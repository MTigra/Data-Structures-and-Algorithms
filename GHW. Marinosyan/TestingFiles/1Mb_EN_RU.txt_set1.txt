     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let honeytrickle over a slice of the loafHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf aboutthe loose collar of his tennis shirt spokeI intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of free thoughtHe walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by hisside Its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels Myfamiliar after me calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen A wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things werecontinually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unpreparedStill an act of perfect contritionFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him andwere salutedFather Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral

bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor peopleOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee SJ of saintFrancis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outwardbound tramOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC C of saint Agathas church north William street on to NewcomenbridgeAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud IslandFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticketThe solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorumIt was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife FatherConmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gentlytiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinilysweetlyFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seatFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky headAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket anda marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU MY CHILD that they have been absolved PRAYFOR ME But they had so many worries in life so many cares poorcreaturesFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather ConmeeFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver SJ and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit LENOMBRE DES ELUS seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created byGod It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost awaste if one might sayAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by theconductor and

the seas adjoiningThen came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one dayThose were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old timesin the baronyFather Conmee walking thought

ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind MOUTONNER the Frenchsaid A just and homely wordFather Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet eveningHe was their rector his reign was mildFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary outAn ivory bookmark told him the pageNones He should have read that

неся в руках чашку с пеной на которой накрест лежали зеркальце и бритва Желтый халат его враспояску слегка вздымался за ним на мягком утреннем ветеркеОн поднял чашку перед собою и возгласил    Остановясь он вгляделся вниз в сумрак винтовой лестницы и грубо крикнул Выходи Клинк Выходи иезуит несчастныйТоржественно он проследовал вперед и взошел на круглую орудийную площадку Обернувшись по сторонам он с важностью троекратно благословил башню окрестный берег и пробуждающиеся горы Потом увидев Стивена Дедала наклонился к нему и начал быстро крестить воздух булькая горлом и подергивая головой Стивен Дедал недовольный и заспанный облокотясь на последнюю ступеньку холодно смотрел на дергающееся булькающее лицо что благословляло его длинное как у лошади и на бестонзурную шевелюру белесую словно окрашенную под светлый дубБык Маллиган заглянул под зеркальце и тут же опять прикрыл чашку По казармам  скомандовал он суровоИ пастырским голосом продолжал Ибо сие о возлюбленные мои есть истинная Христина тело и кровь печенки и селезенки Музыку медленней пожалуйста Господа закройте глаза Минуту Маленькая заминка знаете с белыми шариками Всем помолчатьОн устремил взгляд искоса вверх издал долгий протяжный призывный свист и замер напряженно прислушиваясь Белые ровные зубы койгде поблескивали золотыми крупинками Златоуст Резкий ответный свист дважды прозвучал в тишине Спасибо старина  живо откликнулся он  Так будет чудненько Можешь выключать токОн соскочил с площадки и с важностью поглядел на своего зрителя собирая у ног складки просторного халата Жирное затененное лицо и тяжелый овальный подбородок напоминали средневекового прелата покровителя искусств Довольная улыбка показалась у него на губах Смех да и только  сказал он весело  Это нелепое твое имя как у древнего грекаТкнув пальцем с дружелюбной насмешкой он отошел к парапету посмеиваясь Стивен Дедал поднявшись до конца лестницы устало побрел за ним но не дойдя уселся на край площадки и принялся наблюдать как тот пристроив на парапете зеркальце и обмакнув в пену помазок намыливает шею и щекиВеселый голос Быка Маллигана не умолкал У меня тоже нелепое  Мэйлахи Маллиган два дактиля Но тут звучит чтото эллинское правда ведь Чтото солнечное и резвое как сам бычок Мы непременно должны поехать в Афины Поедешь если я раздобуду у тетушки двадцать фунтовОн положил помазок и в полном восторге воскликнул Это онто поедет Изнуренный иезуитОборвал себя и начал тщательно бриться Послушай Маллиган  промолвил Стивен негромко Да моя радость Долго еще Хейнс будет жить в башнеБык Маллиган явил над правым плечом свежевыбритую щеку Кошмарная личность а  сказал он от души  Этакий толстокожий сакс Он считает что ты не джентльмен Эти мне гнусные англичане Их так и пучит от денег и от запоров Он видите ли из Оксфорда А знаешь Дедал вот у тебято настоящий оксфордский стиль Он все никак тебя не раскусит Нет лучшее тебе имя придумал я Клинк острый клинокОн выбривал с усердием подбородок Всю ночь бредил про какуюто черную пантеру  проговорил Стивен  Где у него ружье Совсем малый спятил  сказал Маллиган  А ты перетрусил не на шутку Еще бы  произнес Стивен с энергией и нарастающим страхом  В кромешном мраке с какимто незнакомцем который стонет и бредит что надо застрелить пантеру Ты спасал тонущих Но я знаешь ли не герой Если он тут останется я ухожуБык Маллиган глядел насупясь на бритву покрытую мыльной пеной Соскочив со своего возвышения он торопливо стал рыться в карманах брюк Драла  пробормотал он сквозь зубыВернувшись к площадке он запустил руку в верхний карман Стивена и сказал Позвольте одолжиться вашим сморкальником вытереть нашу бритвуСтивен покорно дал ему вытащить и развернуть напоказ держа за угол измятый и нечистый платок Бык Маллиган заботливо вытер лезвие Вслед за этим разглядывая платок он объявил Сморкальник барда Новый оттенок в палитру ирландского стихотворца сопливозеленый Почти ощущаешь вкус правдаОн снова поднялся к парапету и бросил долгий взгляд на залив Ветерок шевелил белокурую под светлый дуб шевелюру Господи  сказал он негромко  Как верно названо море у Элджи седая нежная мать Сопливозеленое море Яйцещемящее море Эпи ойнопа понтонАх эти греки Дедал Надо мне тебя обучить Ты должен прочесть их в подлиннике Талатта Талатта  Наша великая и нежная мать Иди сюда и взгляниСтивен встал и подошел к парапету Перегнувшись он посмотрел вниз на воду и на почтовый пароход выходящий из гавани Кингстауна Наша могущественная мать  произнес Бык МаллиганВнезапно он отвел взгляд от моря и большими пытливыми глазами посмотрел Стивену в лицо Моя тетка считает ты убил свою мать  сказал он  Поэтому она бы мне вообще запретила с тобой встречаться Ктото ее убил  сумрачно бросил Стивен Черт побери Клинк уж на колени ты бы мог стать если умирающая мать просит  сказал Бык Маллиган  Я сам гипербореец не хуже тебя Но это ж подумать только мать с последним вздохом умоляет стать на колени помолиться за нее  и ты отказываешься Нет чтото в тебе зловещееОборвал себя и начал намыливать другую щеку Всепрощающая улыбка тронула его губы Но бесподобный комедиант  шепнул он тихонько  Клинк бесподобнейший из комедиантовОн брился плавно и осмотрительно в истовом молчанииСтивен поставив локоть на шершавый гранит подперев лоб ладонью неподвижно смотрел на обтерханные края своего черного лоснистого рукава Боль что не была еще болью любви саднила сердце его Во сне безмолвно она явилась ему после смерти ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева а дыхание когда она с немым укором склонилась над ним веяло сыростью могильного тлена Поверх ветхой манжеты он видел море которое сытый голос превозносил как великую и нежную мать Кольцо залива и горизонта заполняла тусклозеленая влагаБелый фарфоровый сосуд у ее смертного одра заполняла тягучая зеленая желчь которую она с громкими стонами извергала из своей гниющей печени в приступах мучительной рвотыБык Маллиган заново обтер бритву Эх песбедолага  с участием вздохнул он  Надо бы выдать тебе рубашку да хоть пару сморкальников А как те штаны что купили с рук Как будто впору  отвечал СтивенБык Маллиган атаковал ложбинку под нижней губой Смех да и только  произнес он довольно  Верней будет с ног Дознайся какая там пьянь заразная таскала их У меня есть отличная пара серые в узкую полоску Ты бы в них выглядел потрясающе Нет кроме шуток Клинк Ты очень недурно смотришься когда прилично одет Спасибо  ответил Стивен  Если они серые я их не могу носить Он их не может носить  сказал Бык Маллиган своему отражению в зеркале  Этикет значит этикет Он мать родную убил но серые брюки ни за что не оденетОн сложил аккуратно бритву и легкими касаньями пальцев ощупал гладкую кожуСтивен перевел взгляд с залива на жирное лицо с мутноголубыми бегающими глазами Этот малый с кем я сидел в Корабле прошлый вечер  сказал Бык Маллиган  уверяет у тебя ппс Он в желтом доме работает у Конопли Нормана Прогрессивный паралич со слабоумиемОн описал зеркальцем полукруг повсюду просверкав эту весть солнечными лучами уже сияющими над морем Изогнутые бритые губы кончики блестящих белых зубов смеялись Смех овладел всем его сильным и ладным телом На полюбуйсяка на себя горебард  сказал онСтивен наклонился и глянул в подставленное зеркало расколотое кривой трещиной Волосы дыбом Так взор его и прочих видит меня Кто мне выбрал это лицо Эту паршивую шкуру псабедолаги Оно тоже спрашивает меня Я его стянул у служанки из комнаты  поведал Бык Маллиган  Ей в самый раз такое Тетушка ради Мэйлахи всегда нанимает неказистых Не введи его во искушение И зовутто УрсулойСнова залившись смехом он убрал зеркальце изпод упорного взгляда Стивена Ярость Калибана не видящего в зеркале своего отражения  изрек он Как жалко Уайльд не дожил на тебя поглядетьОтступив и показывая на зеркало Стивен с горечью произнес Вот символ ирландского искусства Треснувшее зеркало служанкиНеожиданно и порывисто Бык Маллиган подхватил Стивена под руку и зашагал с ним вокруг башни позвякивая бритвой и зеркальцем засунутыми в карман Грех тебя так дразнить правда Клинк  сказал он дружески  Видит бог в голове у тебя побольше чем у них всехЕще выпад отбит Скальпель художника страшит его как меня  докторский Хладная сталь пера Треснувшее зеркало служанки Ты это скажи тому олуху из Оксфорда да вытяни из него гинею Он весь провонял деньгами и считает что ты не джентльмен А у самого папаша набил мошну сбывая негритосам слабительное а может еще на каких делишках Эх Клинк если бы мы с тобой действовали сообща уж мы бы коечто сделали для нашего острова Эллинизировали бы егоРука Крэнли Его рука И подумать только ты вынужден побираться у этих свиней Я одинединственный понимаю что ты за человек Почему ж ты так мало мне доверяешь Изза чего все воротишь нос Изза Хейнса Да пусть только пикнет я притащу Сеймура и мы ему закатим трепку еще похлеще чем досталась Клайву КемпторпуКрики юных богатеньких голосов в квартире Клайва Кемпторпа Бледнолицые держатся за бока от хохота хватаются друг за друга ох умора Обри бережно весть эту ей передай Сейчас помру В изрезанной рубашке вьющейся лентами по воздуху в съехавших до полу штанах он спотыкаясь скачет вокруг стола а за ним Эйдс из Магдалины с портновскими ножницами Мордочка ошалелого теленка позолоченная вареньем Не надо не сдирайте штаны Не набрасывайтесь на меня как бешеныеКрики из распахнутого окна вспугивают вечер во дворе колледжа Глухой садовник в фартуке замаскированный лицом Мэтью Арнольда продвигается по темному газону с косилкой вглядываясь в танцующий рой травинокНам самим новое язычество омфал Ладно пусть остается  сказал Стивен  Такто он ничего только по ночам Тогда в чем же дело  наседал Бык Маллиган  Давай рожай Ято ведь напрямик с тобой Что у тебя такое против меняОни остановились глядя туда где тупая оконечность мыса БрэйХед покоилась на воде словно голова спящего кита Стивен осторожно высвободил руку Ты хочешь чтобы я сказал тебе  спросил он Да в чем там дело  повторил Бык Маллиган  Я ничего не припоминаюГоворя это он в упор посмотрел на Стивена Легкий ветерок пробежал по его лицу вороша светлую спутанную шевелюру и зажигая в глазах серебряные искорки беспокойстваСтивен удручаясь собственным голосом сказал Ты помнишь как я пришел к тебе домой в первый раз после смерти материБык Маллиган мгновенно нахмурившись отвечал Как Где Убей не могу припомнить Я запоминаю только идеи и ощущения Ну и что Чего там стряслось бога ради Ты готовил чай  продолжал Стивен  а я пошел на кухню за кипятком Из комнат вышла твоя мать и с ней ктото из гостей Она спросила кто у тебя Ну  не отступал Бык Маллиган  А я что сказал Я уже все забыл А ты сказал  ответил Стивен ему  Да так просто Дедал у которого мамаша подохлаБык Маллиган покраснел и стал казаться от этого моложе и привлекательней Я так сказал  переспросил он  И что же Что тут такогоНервным движением он стряхнул свое замешательство А что потвоему смерть  спросил он  твоей матери или твоя или положим моя Ты видел только как умирает твоя мать А я каждый день вижу как они отдают концы и в Ричмонде и в Скорбящей да после их крошат на потроха в анатомичке Это и называется подох ничего больше И не о чем говорить Ты вот не соизволил стать на колени и помолиться за свою мать когда она просила тебя на смертном одре А почему Да потому что в тебе эта проклятая иезуитская закваска только она проявляется наоборот По мне тут одна падаль и пустая комедия Ее лобные доли уже не действуют Она называет доктора сэр Питер Тизл и хочет нарвать лютиков с одеяла Уж не перечь ей вотвот все кончится Ты сам не исполнил ее предсмертную просьбу а теперь дуешься на меня что я не скулил как наемный плакальщик от Лалуэтта Абсурд Допустим я и сказал так Но я вовсе не хотел оскорбить память твоей материЕго речь вернула ему самоуверенность Стивен скрывая зияющие раны оставленные словами в его сердце как можно суше сказал Я и не говорю что это оскорбляет мою мать Так что же тогда  спросил Бык Маллиган Это оскорбляет меня  был ответБык Маллиган круто повернулся на каблуках Нет невозможный субъект  воскликнул онИ пошел прочь быстрым шагом вдоль парапета Стивен остался на месте недвижно глядя на мыс и на спокойную гладь залива Море и мыс сейчас подернулись дымкой В висках стучала кровь застилая взор и он чувствовал как лихорадочно горят его щекиГромкий голос позвал снизу из башни Маллиган вы где наверху Сейчас иду  откликнулся Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Взгляни на море Что ему до всех оскорблений Бросайка лучше Лойолу Клинк и двигаем вниз Наш сакс поджидает уже свой беконГолова его задержалась на миг над лестницей вровень с крышей И не хандри изза этого целый день У меня же семь пятниц на неделеОставь скорбные думыГолова скрылась но мерный голос продолжал опускаясь доноситься из лестничного проемаНе прячь глаза и не скорбиНад горькой тайною любвиТам Фергус правит в полный ростВладыка медных колесницВ мирном спокойствии утра тени лесов неслышно проплывали от лестничного проема к морю туда куда он глядел У берега и мористей водная гладь белела следами стремительных легких стоп Морской волны белеет грудьПопарные сплетения ударений Рука перебирающая струны арфы рождает сплетения аккордов Слитносплетенных словес словно волн белогрудых мерцаньеОблако медленно наползает на солнце и гуще делается в тени зелень залива Он был за спиной у него сосуд горьких вод Песня Фергуса Я пел ее оставшись дома один приглушая долгие сумрачные аккорды Дверь к ней была открыта она хотела слышать меня Безмолвно с жалостью и благоговением я приблизился к ее ложу Она плакала на своем убогом одре Над этими словами Стивен над горькой тайною любвиГде же теперь Ее секреты в запертом ящичке старые веера из перьев бальные книжечки с бахромой пропитанные мускусом убор из янтарных бус Когда она была девочкой у ее окошка висела на солнце клетка с птицей Она видела старика Ройса в представлении Свирепый турка и вместе со всеми смеялась когда он распевалОткрою вамЧто рад бы самЯ невидимкой статьМимолетные радости заботливо сложенные надушенные мускусомНе прячь глаза и не скорбиСложены в памяти природы вместе с ее детскими игрушками Скорбные воспоминания осаждают его разум Стакан воды из крана на кухне когда она собиралась к причастию Яблоко с сахаром внутри испеченное для нее на плите в темный осенний вечер Ее изящные ногти окрашенные кровью вшей с детских рубашонокВо сне безмолвно она явилась ему ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева ее дыхание когда она склонилась над ним с неслышными тайными словами веяло сыростью могильного тленаЕе стекленеющие глаза уставились из глубин смерти поколебать и сломить мою душу На меня одного Призрачная свеча освещает ее агонию Призрачные блики на искаженном мукой лице Громко раздается ее дыхание хриплое прерывающееся от ужаса и став на колени все молятся Взгляд ее на мне повергнуть меня            Упырь ТрупоедНет мать Отпусти меня Дай мне жить Эгей КлинкГолос Быка Маллигана раздался певуче в глубине башни приблизился долетев от лестницы позвал снова Стивен еще содрогаясь от вопля своей души услышал теплый щедрый солнечный свет и в воздухе за своей спиной дружеские слова Будь паинькой спускайся Дедал Завтрак готов Хейнс извиняется за то что мешал нам спать Все улажено Иду  сказал Стивен оборачиваясь Давай Христа ради  говорил Маллиган  И ради меня и ради всеобщего благаЕго голова нырнула и вынырнула Я ему передал про твой символ ирландского искусства Говорит очень остроумно Вытяни из него фунт идет То бишь гинею Мне заплатят сегодня  сказал Стивен В школьной шарашке  осведомился Маллиган  А сколько Четыре фунта Одолжи нам один Как угодно  отвечал Стивен Четыре сверкающих соверена  вскричал с восторгом Бык Маллиган  Устроим роскошный выпивон на зависть всем раздруидам Четыре всемогущих соверенаВоздев руки он затопал по каменным ступеням вниз фальшиво распевая с лондонским простонародным акцентомВеселье будет допозднаМы хлопнем виски и винаВ день КоронацииМы славно покутимВеселье будет допозднаИ все мы покутимЛучи солнца веселились над морем Забытая никелевая чашка для бритья поблескивала на парапете Почему я должен ее относить Может оставить тут на весь день памятником забытой дружбеОн подошел к ней подержал с минуту в руках осязая ее прохладу чувствуя запах липкой пены с торчащим в ней помазком Так прежде я носил кадило в Клонгоузе Сейчас я другой и всетаки еще тот же Опять слуга Прислужник слугиВ мрачном сводчатом помещении внутри башни фигура в халате бодро сновала у очага то скрывая то открывая желтое его пламя Мягкий дневной свет падал двумя снопами через высокие оконца на вымощенный плитами пол и там где снопы встречались плыло медленно вращаясь облако дыма от горящего угля и горелого жира Этак мы задохнемся  заметил Бык Маллиган  Хейнс вы не откроете дверьСтивен поставил бритвенную чашку на шкафчик Долговязый человек сидевший на подвесной койке направился к порогу и отворил внутреннюю дверь А у вас есть ключ  спросил голос Ключ у Дедала  отозвался Бык Маллиган  Черти лохматые я уже задыхаюсьНе отрывая взгляда от очага он взревел Клинк Ключ в скважине  сказал Стивен подходя ближеКлюч с резким скрежетом дважды повернулся в замке и тяжелая наружная дверь впустила долгожданные свет и воздух Хейнс остановился в дверях глядя наружу Стивен придвинул к столу свой чемодан поставив его торчком и уселся ждать Бык Маллиган шваркнул жарево на блюдо рядом с собой Потом отнес блюдо и большой чайник к столу поставил и вздохнул с облегчением Ах я вся таю  произнес он  как сказала свечка когда Но  тес Про это не будем Клинк проснись Подавай хлеб масло мед Присоединяйтесь Хейнс Кормежка готова Благослови Господи нас и эти дары твои Черт побери молока нетСтивен достал из шкафчика масленку хлеб и горшочек с медом Бык Маллиган усевшись вскипел внезапным негодованием Что за бардак  возмутился он  Я ж ей сказал  прийти в начале девятого Можно и без молока обойтись  сказал Стивен  В шкафчике есть лимон Да пошел ты со своими парижскими замашками  отвечал Бык Маллиган  Я хочу молочка из СэндикоуваХейнс направляясь к ним от дверей сообщил Идет ваша молочница с молоком Благодать божия  воскликнул Бык Маллиган вскакивая со стула  Присаживайтесь Наливайте чай Сахар в пакете А с треклятой яичницей я больше не желаю возитьсяОн кое как раскромсал жарево на блюде и раскидал его по трем тарелкам приговаривая        Хейнс сел и принялся разливать чай Кладу всем по два куска  сказал он  Слушайте Маллиган какой вы крепкий завариваетеБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб щедрыми ломтями замурлыкал умильным старушечьим голоском Как надоть мне чай заваривать уж я так заварю говаривала матушка Гроган А надоть нужду справлять уж так справлю Боже правый вот это чай  сказал ХейнсБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб так же умильно продолжал Уж такой мой обычай миссис Кахилл  это она говорит А миссис Кахилл на это Ахти сударыня только упаси вас Господи делать оба дела в одну посудину На кончике ножа он протянул каждому из сотрапезников по толстому ломтю хлеба Это же фольклор  сказал он очень серьезно  это для вашей книги Хейнс Пять строчек текста и десять страниц комментариев насчет фольклора и рыбообразных божеств Дандрама Издано сестрамиколдуньями в год великого ураганаОн обернулся к Стивену и подняв брови спросил его с крайней заинтересованностью Не можете ли напомнить коллега где говорится про посудину матушки Гроган в Мабиногионе или в упанишадах Отнюдь не уверен  солидно отвечал Стивен В самом деле  продолжал Бык Маллиган прежним тоном  А отчего же будьте любезны Мне думается  сказал Стивен не прерывая еды  этого не найти ни в Мабиногионе ни за его пределами Матушка Гроган по всей вероятности состоит в родстве с Мэри ЭннБык Маллиган расплылся от удовольствия Прелестно  произнес он сюсюкающим и слащавым голосом показывая белые зубы и жмурясь довольно  Вы так полагаете Совершенно прелестноЗатем вдруг нарочито нахмурясь он хрипло скрипуче зарычал рьяно нарезая новые ломтиНа старуху Мэри ЭннЕй плевать с высоких стенНо задравши свой подолНабив рот яичницей он жевал и мычалВ дверях заслоняя свет появилась фигура женщины Молоко сэр Заходите сударыня  сказал Маллиган  Клинк подайка кувшинСтарушка вошла и остановилась около Стивена Славное утречко сэр  сказала она  Слава Богу Комукому  спросил Маллиган поглядев на нее  Ах да конечноСтивен протянув руку за спину достал из шкафчика молочный кувшин Наши островитяне  заметил Маллиган Хейнсу как бы вскользь  нередко поминают сборщика крайней плоти Сколько сэр  спросила старушка Одну кварту  ответил СтивенОн смотрел как она наливает в мерку а оттуда в кувшин густое белое молоко не свое Старые сморщенные груди Она налила еще мерку с избыткомДревняя и таинственная она явилась из утреннего мира быть может вестницей Наливая молоко она расхваливала его В сочных лугах чуть свет она уже доила сидя на корточках ведьма на поганке скрюченные пальцы проворны у набухшего вымени Мычанием встречала ее привычный приход скотинка шелковая от росы Бедная старушка шелковая коровка  такие прозвища давались ей в старину Старухастранница низший род бессмертных служащая своему захватчику и своему беззаботному обманщику познавшая измену обоих вестница тайны утра Служить или укорять он не знал однако гнушался заискивать перед нею И впрямь прекрасное сударыня  согласился Бык Маллиган наливая им в чашки молоко Вы сэр отведайте  сказала онаУступая ей он сделал глоток Если бы все мы могли питаться такой вот здоровой пищей  объявил он звучно  в этой стране не было бы столько гнилых зубов и гнилых кишок А то живем в болоте едим дешевую дрянь а улицы вымощены навозом пылью и чахоточными плевками А вы сэр на доктора учитесь  спросила старушка Да сударыня  ответил Бык МаллиганСтивен слушал храня презрительное молчание Она покорно внимает зычному голосу своего костоправа и врачевателя меня она знать не знаетГолосу который отпустит ей грехи и помажет для погребения ее тело кроме женских нечистых чресл сотворенное из плоти мужской не по подобию Божию в добычу змею И тому голосу что сейчас заставляет ее умолкнуть с удивлением озираясь Вы понимаете что он говорит  осведомился у нее Стивен Это вы пофранцузски сэр  спросила старушка ХейнсаХейнс с апломбом обратил к ней новую тираду еще длинней Это поирландски  объяснил Бык Маллиган  Вы гэльский знаете Я так и думала по звуку это ирландский  сказала она  А вы не с запада сэр Я англичанин  ответил Хейнс Он англичанин  повторил Бык Маллиган  и он считает в Ирландии надо говорить поирландски Нет спору надо  сказала старушка  мне и самой стыд что не умею на нашем языке А люди умные говорят языкто великий Великий  это не то слово  заявил Бык Маллиган  Он абсолютно великолепен Плесни нам еще чайку Клинк Не хотите ли чашечку сударыня Нет сэр спасибо  отвечала старушка повесив на руку бидон и собираясь идтиХейнс обратился к ней А счет у вас есть Маллиган надо бы заплатить верноСтивен снова наполнил чашки Счет сэр  неуверенно переспросила она  Это значит семь дней по пинте по два пенса это семь раз по два это шиллинг два пенса да эти три дня по кварте по четыре пенса будет три кварты это выходит шиллинг да там один и два всего два и два сэрБык Маллиган вздохнул и отправив в рот горбушку густо намазанную маслом с обеих сторон вытянул вперед ноги и начал рыться в карманах Платить подобает с любезным видом  сказал улыбаясь ХейнсСтивен налил третью чашку слегка закрасив ложечкой чая густое жирное молоко Бык Маллиган выудил из кармана флорин и повертев его в пальцах воскликнул О чудоОн пододвинул флорин по столу к старушке приговаривая Радость моя для тебя все что имею отдамСтивен вложил монету в ее нежадную руку За нами еще два пенса  заметил он Это не к спеху сэр  уверяла она убирая монету  Совсем не к спеху Всего вам доброго сэрПоклонившись она ушла напутствуемая нежным речитативом Быка Маллигана Я бы с восторгом весь мирК милым повергнул стопамОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Серьезно Дедал Я совсем на мели Беги в свою школьную шарашку да принеси оттуда малость деньжонок Сегодня бардам положено пить и пировать Ирландия ожидает что в этот день каждый выполнит свой долг Что до меня  заметил Хейнс поднимаясь  то я должен сегодня посетить вашу национальную библиотеку Сперва поплавать  заявил Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и самым учтивым тоном спросил Не сегодня ли Клинк день твоего ежемесячного омовенияИ пояснил обращаясь к Хейнсу Оный нечистый бард имеет правило мыться один раз в месяц Всю Ирландию омывает Гольфстрим  промолвил Стивен поливая хлеб струйкой медаХейнс отозвался из угла легким узлом повязывая шейный платок под открытым воротом спортивной рубашки Я буду собирать ваши изречения если вы позволитеОбращено ко мне Они моются банятся оттираются Жагала сраму Совесть А пятно все на месте Это отлично сказано что треснувшее зеркало служанки  символ ирландского искусстваБык Маллиган толкнув Стивена ногой под столом задушевно пообещал Погодите Хейнс вот вы еще послушаете его о Гамлете Нет я в самом деле намерен  продолжал Хейнс обращаясь к Стивену  Я как раз думал на эту тему когда пришло это ветхое создание А я чтонибудь заработаю на этом  спросил СтивенХейнс рассмеялся и сказал снимая мягкую серую шляпу с крюка на котором была подвешена койка Чего не знаю того не знаюНеторопливо он направился к двери Бык Маллиган перегнулся к Стивену и грубо с нажимом прошипел Не можешь без своих штучек Для чего ты это ему А что  возразил Стивен  Задача  раздобыть денег У кого У него или у молочницы Помоему орел или решка Я про тебя ему уши прожужжал  не отставал Бык Маллиган  а тут извольте ты со своим вшивым злопамятством да замогильными иезуитскими шуточками У меня нет особой надежды  заметил Стивен  как на него так и на нееБык Маллиган трагически вздохнул и положил руку Стивену на плечо Лишь на меня Клинк  произнес онИ совсем другим голосом добавил Честно признаться я и сам считаю ты прав На хрена они кроме этого сдались Чего ты их не морочишь как я Пошли они все к ляду Надо выбираться из этого бардакаОн встал важно распустил пояс и совлек с себя свой халат произнося отрешенным тоном И был Маллиган разоблачен от одежд егоСодержимое карманов он выложил на стол со словами Вот тебе твой соплюшникИ надевая жесткий воротничок и строптивый галстук стыдил их и укорял а с ними и запутавшуюся часовую цепочку Руки его нырнув в чемодан шарили там покуда он требовал себе чистый носовой платок Жагала сраму Клянусь богом мы же обязаны поддерживать репутацию Желаю бордовые перчатки и зеленые башмаки Противоречие Я противоречу себе Ну что же значит я противоречу себе Ветреник Малахия Его говорливые руки метнули мягкий черный снаряд И вот твоя шляпа в стиле Латинского КварталаСтивен поймал ее и надел на голову Хейнс окликнул их от дверей Друзья вы двигаетесь Я готов  отозвался Бык Маллиган идя к двери  Пошли Клинк Кажется ты уже все доел после насОтрешенный и важный проследовал он к порогу не без прискорбия сообщая И пойдя вон плюхнулся с горкиСтивен взяв ясеневую тросточку стоявшую у стены тронулся за ним следом Выйдя на лестницу он притянул неподатливую стальную дверь и запер ее Гигантский ключ сунул во внутренний карманУ подножия лестницы Бык Маллиган спросил А ты ключ взял Да он у меня  отвечал Стивен перегоняя ихОн шел вперед За спиной у себя он слышал как Бык Маллиган сбивает тяжелым купальным полотенцем верхушки папоротников или трав Кланяйтесь сэр Да как вы смеете сэрХейнс спросил А вы платите аренду за башню Двенадцать фунтов  ответил Бык Маллиган Военному министру  добавил Стивен через плечоОни приостановились покуда Хейнс разглядывал башню Потом он заметил Зимой унылое зрелище надо думать Как она называется Мартелло Их выстроили по указанию Билли Питта  сказал Бык Маллиган  когда с моря угрожали французы Но наша  это омфал И какие же у вас идеи о Гамлете  спросил у Стивена Хейнс О нет  воскликнул страдальчески Бык Маллиган  Я этого не выдержу я вам не Фома Аквинат измысливший пятьдесят пять причин Дайте мне сперва принять пару кружекОн обернулся к Стивену аккуратно одергивая лимонный жилет Тебе ж самому для такого надо не меньше трех правда Клинк Это уж столько ждет  ответил тот равнодушно  может и еще подождать Вы разжигаете мое любопытство  любезно заметил Хейнс  Тут какойнибудь парадокс Фу  сказал Маллиган  Мы уже переросли Уайльда и парадоксы Все очень просто Он с помощью алгебры доказывает что внук Гамлета  дедушка Шекспира а сам он призрак собственного отца Каккак  переспросил Хейнс показывая было на Стивена  Вот он самБык Маллиган накинул полотенце на шею наподобие столы патера и корчась от смеха шепнул на ухо Стивену О тень Клинкастаршего Иафет в поисках отца Мы по утрам усталые  сказал Стивен Хейнсу  А это довольно долго рассказыватьБык Маллиган снова зашагавший вперед воздел руки к небу Только священная кружка способна развязать Дедалу язык  объявил он Я хочу сказать  Хейнс принялся объяснять Стивену на ходу  эта башня и эти скалы мне чемто напоминают Эльсинор Выступ утеса грозного нависшего над морем не так лиБык Маллиган на миг неожиданно обернулся к Стивену но ничего не сказал В этот сверкнувший безмолвный миг Стивен словно увидел свой облик в пыльном дешевом трауре рядом с их яркими одеяниями Это удивительная история  сказал Хейнс опять останавливая ихГлаза светлые как море под свежим ветром еще светлей твердые и сторожкие Правитель морей он смотрел на юг через пустынный залив где лишь маячил смутно на горизонте дымный плюмаж далекого пакетбота да парусник лавировал у банки Маглине Я гдето читал богословское истолкование  произнес он в задумчивости  Идея Отца и Сына Сын стремящийся к воссоединению с ОтцомБык Маллиган немедля изобразил ликующую физиономию с ухмылкою до ушейОн поглядел на них блаженно разинув красивый рот и глаза его в которых он тут же пригасил всякую мысль моргали с полоумным весельем Он помотал тудасюда болтающейся башкой болванчика тряся полями круглой панамы и запел дурашливым бездумно веселым голосомЯ юноша странный каких поискатьОтец мой был птицей еврейкою  матьС Иосифомплотником жить я не сталБродяжничал и на Голгофу попалОн предостерегающе поднял палецА кто говорит я не бог тем плутамВинца что творю из воды я не дамПусть пьют они воду и тайна яснаКак снова я воду творю из винаБыстрым прощальным жестом он подергал за Стивенову тросточку и устремился вперед к самому краю утеса хлопая себя по бокам как будто плавниками или крыльями готовящимися взлететь и продолжая свое пениеПрощай же и речи мои запишиО том что воскрес я везде расскажиМне плоть не помеха коль скоро я богЛечу я на небо Прощай же дружокВыделывая антраша он подвигался на их глазах к сорокафутовому провалу махая крылоподобными руками легко подскакивая и шляпа ветреника колыхалась на свежем ветру доносившем до них его отрывистые птичьи крикиХейнс который посмеивался весьма сдержанно идя рядом со Стивеном заметил Мне кажется тут не стоит смеяться Он сильно богохульствует Впрочем я лично не из верующих С другой стороны его веселье както придает всему безобидность не правда ли Как это у него называется Иосифплотник Баллада об Иисусешутнике  буркнул Стивен Так вы это раньше слышали  спросил Хейнс Каждый день три раза после еды  последовал сухой ответ Но вы самито не из верующих  продолжал расспрашивать Хейнс  Я хочу сказать верующих в узком смысле слова Творение из ничего чудеса Бог как личность Мне думается у этого слова всего один смысл  сказал СтивенОстановясь Хейнс вынул серебряный портсигар с мерцающим зеленым камнем Нажав на пружину крышки большим пальцем он раскрыл его и протянул Стивену Спасибо  отозвался тот беря сигаретуХейнс взял другую себе и снова защелкнул крышку Спрятав обратно портсигар он вынул из жилетного кармана никелированную трутницу тем же манером раскрыл ее прикурил и заслонив язычок пламени ладонью подставил Стивену Да конечно  проговорил он когда они пошли дальше  Вы либо веруете либо нет верно Лично я не мог бы переварить идею личного Бога Надеюсь вы ее не придерживаетесь Вы видите во мне  произнес Стивен мрачно и недовольно  пример ужасающего вольнодумстваОн шел выжидая продолжения разговора держа сбоку ясеневую тросточкуЕе кованый наконечник легко чертил по тропинке поскрипывая у ног Мой дружочек следом за мной с тоненьким зовом Стиииииивии Волнистая линия вдоль тропинки Они пройдут по ней вечером затемно возвращаясь Он хочет ключ Ключ мой я плачу аренду Но я ем хлеб его что горестен устамОтдай и ключ Все отдай Он спросит про него По глазам было видно В конечном счете  начал ХейнсСтивен обернулся и увидал что холодный взгляд смеривший его был не таким уж недобрым В конечном счете мне кажется вы способны достичь свободы Похоже что вы сами себе господин Я слуга двух господ  отвечал Стивен  или если хотите госпож англичанки и итальянки Итальянки  переспросил ХейнсПолоумная королева старая и ревнивая На колени передо мной А некто третий  продолжал Стивен  желает чтобы я был у него на побегушках Итальянки  спросил снова Хейнс  Что это значит Британской империи  пояснил Стивен покраснев  и Римской святой соборной и апостольской церквиПрежде чем заговорить Хейнс снял с нижней губы приставшие крошки табака Вполне понимаю вас  спокойно заметил он  Я бы даже сказал для ирландца естественно так думать Мы в Англии сознаем что обращались с вами несправедливо Но повинна тут видимо историяГордые полновластные титулы прозвучали в памяти Стивена победным звоном медных колоколов        неспешный рост вызревание догматов и обрядов как его собственных заветных мыслей химия звезд Апостольский символ в мессе папы Марцеллия голоса сливаются в мощное утверждающее соло и под их пение недреманный ангел церкви воинствующей обезоруживал ересиархов и грозил имОрды ересей в скособоченных митрах разбегаются наутек Фотий орава зубоскалов средь коих и Маллиган Арий воевавший всю жизнь против единосущия Сына Отцу Валентин что гнушался земным естеством Христа и хитроумный ересиарх из Африки Савеллий по чьим утверждениям Отец Сам был собственным СыномСлова которые только что сказал Маллиган зубоскаля над чужеземцемПустое зубоскальство Неизбежная пустота ожидает их всех что ткут ветер угрозу обезоруживанье и поражение несут им стройные боевые порядки ангелов церкви воинство Михаила в пору раздоров всегда встающее на ее защиту с копьями и щитамиБраво бис Продолжительные аплодисменты     Я разумеется британец  продолжал голос Хейнса  и мыслю я соответственно К тому же мне вовсе не хочется увидеть свою страну в руках немецких евреев Боюсь что сейчас это главная опасность для нашей нацииДвое наблюдая стояли на краю обрыва  делец и лодочник Плывет в БаллокЛодочник с неким пренебрежением кивнул на север залива Там будет саженей пять  сказал он  Туда его и вынесет после часу когда прилив начнется Нынче девятый деньПро утопленника Парус кружит по пустынной бухте поджидая когда вынырнет раздутый мешок и обернет к солнцу солью беленное вспученное лицоА вот и яИзвилистой тропкой они спустились к неширокому заливчику Бык Маллиган стоял на камне без пиджака отшпиленный галстук струился по ветру за плечом Поблизости от него юноша держась за выступ скалы медленно полягушачьи разводил зелеными ногами в студенистой толще воды А брат с тобой Мэйлахи Да нет он в Уэстмите у Бэннонов Все еще Мне Бэннон прислал открытку Говорит подцепил себе там одну молоденькую Фотодевочка он ее так зовет Заснял значит С короткой выдержкойБык Маллиган уселся снять башмаки Изза выступа скалы высунулось красное отдувающееся лицо Пожилой мужчина вылез на камни вода блестела на его лысине с седоватым венчиком вода струилась по груди по брюху капала с черных мешковатых трусовБык Маллиган посторонился пропуская его и бросив взгляд на Хейнса и Стивена ногтем большого пальца набожно перекрестил себе лоб уста и грудную клетку А Сеймур опять в городе  сказал юноша ухватившись снова за выступ  Медицину побоку решил в армию Да иди ты  хмыкнул Бык Маллиган На той неделе уже в казарму А ты знаешь ту рыженькую из Карлайла Лили Знаю Прошлый вечер на пирсе с ним обжималась У папаши денег до черта Может она залетела Это ты Сеймура спроси Сеймур  кровопускающий офицер  объявил Бык МаллиганКивнув самому себе он стянул с ног брюки выпрямился и изрек избитую истину Рыжие бабы блудливы как козыВстревоженно оборвав принялся щупать свои бока под вздувшейся от ветра рубашкой У меня нет двенадцатого ребра  возопил он  Я  Беззубый Клинк и я мы сверхчеловекиОн выпутался из рубашки и кинул ее к вороху остальной одежды Здесь залезаешь Мэйлахи Ага Дайка местечко на кроватиЮноша в воде оттолкнулся назад и в два сильных ровных гребка выплыл на середину заливчика Хейнс с сигаретой присел на камень А вы не будете  спросил Бык Маллиган Попозже  отвечал Хейнс  После завтрака не сразуСтивен повернулся идти Я ухожу Маллиган  сказал он А дайка тот ключ Клинк  сказал Бык Маллиган  мою рубашку прижатьСтивен протянул ему ключ Бык Маллиган положил его на ворох одежды И двухпенсовик на пинту Кидай туда жеСтивен кинул два пенса на мягкий ворох Одеваются раздеваются Бык Маллиган выпрямившись сложив перед грудью руки торжественно произнес Крадущий у бедного дает взаймы Господу Так говорил ЗаратустраЖирное тело нырнуло в воду Еще увидимся  сказал Хейнс повернувшись к уходящему Стивену и улыбаясь необузданности ирландцевБычьих рогов конских копыт и улыбки сакса В Корабле  крикнул Бык Маллиган  В полпервого Ладно  ответил СтивенОн шел по тропинке что вилась вверх    Седой нимб священника за скалой куда тот скромно удалился для одевания Сегодня я не буду здесь ночевать Домой идти тоже не могуЗов протяжный и мелодичный донесся до него с моря На повороте тропинки он помахал рукой Голос донесся снова Лоснящаяся темная голова тюленья далеко от берега круглаяЗахватчикЭпизод  Кокрейн ты скажи Какой город послал за ним Тарент сэр Правильно А потом Потом было сражение сэр Правильно А гдеМальчуган с пустым выражением уставился в пустоту окнаБасни дочерей памяти Но ведь чем то и непохоже на басни памяти Тогда  фраза сказанная в сердцах шум Блейковых крыл избытка Слышу как рушатся пространства обращаются в осколки стекло и камень и время охвачено синебагровым пламенем конца Что же нам остается Я позабыл место сэр В  году до нашей эры Аскулум  бросил Стивен заглянув в книгу с рубцами кровопролитий Да сэр И он сказал еще одна такая победа  и мы погиблиВот эту фразу мир и запомнил Утеха для скудоумных Над усеянной телами равниной опершись на копье генерал обращается с холма к офицерам Любой генерал к любым офицерам А те внимают Теперь ты Армстронг  сказал Стивен  А каков был конец Пирра Конец Пирра сэр Я знаю сэр Спросите меня сэр  вызвался Комин Нет ты обожди Армстронг Ты чтонибудь знаешь о ПирреВ ранце у Армстронга уютно притаился кулек с вялеными фигами Время от времени он разминал их в ладонях и отправлял потихоньку в рот Крошки приставшие к кожице на губах Подслащенное мальчишеское дыханиеЗажиточная семья гордятся что старший сын во флоте Виксроуд Долки О Пирре сэр Пирр  это пирсВсе засмеялись Визгливый злорадный смех без веселья Армстронг обвел взглядом класс дурашливая ухмылка на профиле Сейчас совсем разойдутся знают что мне их не приструнить а плату их папаши внесли Тогда объясни  сказал Стивен касаясь плеча мальчугана книжкой  что это такое пирс Ну пирс сэр  тянул Армстронг  Такая штука над морем Вроде как мост В Кингстауне пирс сэрКое кто засмеялся снова без веселья но со значением Двое на задней парте начали перешептываться Да Они знали никогда не изведав никогда не были невинны Все Он с завистью оглядел их лица Эдит Этель Герти Лили Похожи на этих дыхание тоже подслащенное от чая с вареньем браслеты звякают во время возни Кингстаунский пирс  повторил Стивен  Да несбывшийся мостИх взгляды смутились от его слов Как это сэр  спросил Комин  Мост он же через рекуХейнсу в его цитатник Не для этих ушей Вечером среди пьянки и пустословия пронзить словно пирс воду ровную гладь его ума А что в том Шут при господском дворе благоволимый и презираемый добился от господина милостивой похвалы Почему все они выбрали эту роль Не только ведь ради ласки и поощрения Для них тоже история  это сказка давно навязшая в ушах а своя страна  закладная лавкаРазве Пирр не пал в Аргосе от руки старой ведьмы а Юлия Цезаря не закололи кинжалом Их уже не изгнать из памяти Время поставило на них свою мету и заключило сковав в пространстве что занимали уничтоженные ими бесчисленные возможности Но были ль они возможны если их так и не было Или то лишь было возможным что состоялось Тките ветра ткачи Сэр а расскажите нам чтонибудь Ага сэр про привидения Где мы остановились тут  спросил Стивен открывая другую книгу Оставь рыданья  сказал Комин Ну давай Толбот А историю сэр Потом  сказал Стивен  Давай ТолботСмуглый мальчуган раскрыл книгу и ловко приладил ее за укрытием своего ранца Он начал читать стихотворение запинаясь и часто подглядывая в текстОставь рыданья о пастух оставь рыданьяЛикид не умирал напрасна скорбь твояХотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертаньяТогда это должно быть движением актуализация возможного как таковогоФраза Аристотеля сложилась из бормотанья ученика и поплыла вдаль в ученую тишину библиотеки Святой Женевьевы где он читал огражден от греховного Парижа вечер за вечером Рядом хрупкий сиамец штудировал учебник стратегии Вокруг меня насыщенные и насыщающиеся мозги  пришпиленные под лампочками слабо подрагивающие щупиками  а во тьме моего ума грузное подземное чудище неповоротливое боящееся света шевелит драконовой чешуей Мысль  это мысль о мысли Безмятежная ясность Душа  это неким образом все сущее душа  форма форм Безмятежность нежданная необъятная лучащаяся форма формТолбот твердилИ дивной властию тогокто шел по водамИ дивной властию Можешь перевернуть  сказал Стивен безразлично  Я ничего не вижу Чего сэр  спросил простодушно Толбот подаваясь впередЕго рука перевернула страницу Он снова выпрямился и продолжал как будто припомнив О том кто шел по водам И здесь лежит его тень на этих малодушных сердцах и на сердце безбожника на его устах на моих Она и на снедаемых любопытством лицах тех что предложили ему динарий Кесарево кесарю а Божие Богу Долгий взгляд темных глаз загадочные слова что без конца будут ткаться на кроснах церкви ДаОтгадай загадку будешь молодецЗернышки посеять мне велел отецТолбот закрыл книжку и сунул ее в ранец Все уже  спросил Стивен Да сэр В десять хоккей сэр Короткий день сэр Четверг А кто отгадает загадку  спросил СтивенОни распихивали учебники падали карандаши шуршали страницыСгрудившись вместе защелкивали и затягивали ранцы разом весело тараторя Загадку сэр Давайте я сэр Я дайте я сэр Какую потрудней сэр Загадка такая  сказал СтивенКочет поетЧист небосводКолокол в небеОдиннадцать бьетБедной душе на небесаЧас улетать настает Отгадайте что это Чего чего сэр Еще разок сэр Мы не расслышалиГлаза их расширились когда он повторил строчки Настала пауза а потом Кокрейн попросил Скажите отгадку сэр Мы сдаемсяСтивен чувствуя подкативший к горлу комок ответил Это лис хоронит свою бабку под остролистомНервически рассмеявшись он встал и эхом ему нестройно раздались их возгласы разочарованияВ дверь стукнули клюшкой и голос из коридора прокричал ХоккейОни кинулись как оголтелые боком выскакивая из за парт перемахивая через сиденья Вмиг комната опустела и из раздевалки послышался их гомон и грохот клюшек и башмаковСарджент единственный кто остался медленно подошел протягивая раскрытую тетрадь Его спутанные волосы и тощая шея выдавали явную неготовность слабые глаза в запотевших очках глядели просяще На блеклой бескровной щеке расплылось чернильное пятно в форме финика еще свежее и влажное как след слизняОн подал тетрадку Наверху страницы было выведено Примеры Дальше шли цифры вкривь и вкось а внизу имелся корявый росчерк с загогулинами и с кляксой Сирил Сарджент личная подпись и печать Мистер Дизи велел все снова переписать и показать вам сэрСтивен потрогал края тетрадки Что толку Ты уже понял как их решать  спросил он С одиннадцатого до пятнадцатого  отвечал Сарджент  Мистер Дизи сказал надо было списать с доски сэр А сам теперь сможешь сделать Нет сэрУродлив и бестолков худая шея спутанные волосы пятно на щеке  след слизня Но ведь какаято любила его выносила под сердцем нянчила на руках Если бы не она мир в своей гонке давно подмял бы его растоптал словно бескостого слизня А она любила его жидкую слабосильную кровь взятую у нее самой Значит это и есть настоящее Единственно истинное в жизни В святом своем рвении пламенный Колумбан перешагнул через тело матери простершейся перед ним Ее не стало дрожащий остов ветки попаленной огнем запах розового дерева и могильного тлена Она спасла его не дала растоптать и ушла почти не коснувшись бытия Бедная душа улетела на небеса  и на вересковой пустоши под мерцающими звездами лис горящие беспощадные глаза рыжим и хищным духом разит от шкуры рыл землю вслушивался откидывал землю вслушивался и рыл рылСидя с ним рядом Стивен решал задачу Он с помощью алгебры доказывает что призрак Шекспира  это дедушка Гамлета Сарджент глядел искоса через съехавшие очки Из раздевалки стук клюшек с поля голоса и глухие удары по мячуЗначки на странице изображали чопорный мавританский танец маскарад букв в причудливых шляпах квадратов и кубов Подача руки поворот поклон партнеру вот так бесовские измышленья мавров И они уже покинули мир Аверроэс и Моисей Маймонид мужи темные обличьем и обхожденьем ловящие в свои глумливые зеркала смутную душу мира и тьма в свете светит и свет не объемлет ее Ну как понял Сможешь сам сделать следующий Да сэрВялыми неуверенными движениями пера Сарджент списал условие То и дело медля в надежде помощи рука его старательно выводила кривые значки слабая краска стыда проступала сквозь блеклую кожу щек   родительный субъекта и объекта Она вскормила его своей жидкой кровью и свернувшимся молоком скрывала от чужих взоров его пеленкиЯ был как он те же косые плечи та же нескладность Детство мое сгорбясь подле меня Ушло и не коснуться его пускай хоть раз хоть слегка Мое ушло а его потаенно как наши взгляды Тайны безмолвно застывшие в темных чертогах двух наших сердец тайны уставшие тиранствовать тираны мечтающие быть свергнутымиПример был решен Вот видишь как просто  сказал Стивен вставая Ага сэр спасибо  ответил СарджентОн промокнул страницу и отнес тетрадь к парте Бери свою клюшку и ступай к ребятам  сказал Стивен направляясь к дверям следом за нескладной фигуркой Ага сэрВ коридоре послышалось его имя его окликали с поля Сарджент Беги мистер Дизи тебя зовет  поторопил СтивенСтоя на крыльце он глядел как пентюх поспешает на поле битвы где голоса затеяли крикливую перебранку Их разделили на команды и мистер Дизи возвращался шагая через метелки травы затянутыми в гетры ногамиЕдва он дошел до школы как снова заспорившие голоса позвали его назад Он обернул к ним сердитые седые усы Ну что еще  прокричал он несколько раз не слушая Кокрейн и Холлидей в одной команде сэр  крикнул ему Стивен Вы не обождете минутку у меня в кабинете  попросил мистер Дизи  пока я тут наведу порядокОн озабоченно зашагал по полю обратно строго покрикивая своим старческим голосом В чем дело Что там ещеПронзительные их крики взметнулись разом со всех сторон от него фигурки их обступили его кольцом а слепящее солнце выбеливало мед его плохо выкрашенной головыПрокуренный застоялый дух царил в кабинете вместе с запахом кожи вытертых тускложелтых кресел Как в первый день когда мы с ним рядились тут Как было вначале так и ныне Сбоку стоял подносик с монетами Стюарта жалкое сокровище ирландских болот и присно И в футляре для ложек на выцветшем алом плюше двенадцать апостолов проповедовавших всем языкам и во веки вековТоропливые шаги по каменному крыльцу в коридоре Раздувая редкие свои усы мистер Дизи остановился у стола Сначала наши небольшие расчетыОн вынул из сюртука перетянутый кожаной ленточкой бумажник Раскрыв его извлек две банкноты одну  из склеенных половинок и бережно положил на стол Два  сказал он вновь перетягивая и убирая бумажникТеперь в хранилище золотых запасов Ладонь Стивена в неловкости блуждала по раковинам лежавшим грудой в холодной каменной ступке волнистые рожки и каури и багрянки а эта вот закручена как тюрбан эмира а эта  гребешок святого Иакова Добро старого пилигрима мертвые сокровища пустые ракушкиСоверен новенький и блестящий упал на мягкий ворс скатерти Три  сказал мистер Дизи вертя в руках свою маленькую копилку  Очень удобная штучка  Смотрите Вот сюда соверены Тут шиллинги полукроны шестипенсовики А сюда  кроны СмотритеОн высыпал на ладонь два шиллинга и две кроны Три двенадцать  сказал он  По моему это правильно Благодарю вас сэр  отвечал Стивен с застенчивою поспешностью собирая деньги и пряча их в карман брюк Не за что  сказал мистер Дизи  Вы это заработалиРука Стивена освободившись вернулась снова к пустым ракушкам Тоже символы красоты и власти Толика денег в моем кармане символы запятнанные алчностью и нищетой Не надо их так носить  предостерег мистер Дизи  Гденибудь вытащите и потеряете Купите лучше такую же штуковину Увидите как это удобноОтвечай чтонибудь У меня она часто будет пустоватьТе же место и час та же премудрость и я тот же Вот уже трижды Три петли вокруг меня Ладно Я их могу разорвать в любой миг если захочу Потому что вы не откладываете  мистер Дизи поднял вверх палец  Вы еще не знаете что такое деньги Деньги  это власть Вот поживете с мое Уж я то знаю Если бы молодость знала Как это там у Шекспира Набей потуже кошелек Яго  пробормотал СтивенОн поднял взгляд от праздных ракушек к глазам старого джентльмена Он знал что такое деньги  продолжал мистер Дизи  он их наживал Поэт но в то же время и англичанин А знаете чем англичане гордятся Какие самые гордые слова у англичанинаПравитель морей Холодные как море глаза смотрели на пустынную бухту повинна история  на меня и мои слова без ненависти Что над его империей никогда не заходит солнце Ха  воскликнул мистер Дизи  Это совсем не англичанин Это сказал французский кельтОн постукал своей копилкой о ноготь большого пальца Я вам скажу  объявил он торжественно  чем он больше всего хвастает и гордится Я никому не долженНадо же какой молодец Я никому не должен Я за всю жизнь не занял ни у кого ни шиллинга Вам понятно такое чувство У меня нет долгов ПонятноМаллигану девять фунтов три пары носков пару обуви галстуки Каррэну десять гиней Макканну гинею Фреду Райену два шиллинга Темплу за два обеда Расселу гинею Казинсу десять шиллингов Бобу Рейнольдсу полгинеи Келеру три гинеи миссис Маккернан за комнату пять недель Малая моя толика бессильна В данный момент нет  ответил СтивенМистер Дизи от души рассмеялся пряча свою копилку Я так и думал  сказал он весело  Но когданибудь вам придется к нему прийти Мы народ щедрый но справедливость тоже нужна Я боюсь этих громких слов  сказал Стивен  они нам приносят столько несчастийМистер Дизи вперил суровый взгляд туда где над камином пребывали дородные стати мужчины в клетчатом килте Альберт Эдуард принц Уэльский Вы меня считаете старым замшелым тори  молвил его задумчивый голос  Со времен ОКоннелла я видел три поколения Я помню голод А вы знаете что ложи оранжистов вели агитацию против унии за двадцать лет до того как этим стал заниматься ОКоннелл причем попы вашей церкви его клеймили как демагога У вас фениев короткая памятьВечная славная и благоговейная память Алмазная ложа в Арме великолепном заваленная трупами папистов При оружии в масках плантаторы хриплыми голосами дают присягу Черный север и истинная голубая библия Берегись стриженыеСтивен сделал легкое движение В моих жилах тоже кровь бунтарей  продолжал мистер Дизи  По женской линии Но прямой мой предок  сэр Джон Блэквуд который голосовал за унию Все мы ирландцы и все потомки королей Увы  сказал Стивен     твердо произнес мистер Дизи Это его девиз Он голосовал за унию и ради этого натянул ботфорты и поскакал в Дублин из Нижнего АрдсаТрала  лала трала лалаНа Дублин путь кремнистДеревенщинасквайр в седле лоснящиеся ботфорты Славный денек сэр Джон Славный денек ваша честь Деньденек Деньденек Ботфорты болтаются трусят в Дублин Трала лала трала лала трусят Кстати это напомнило мне  сказал мистер Дизи  Вы бы могли оказать мне услугу через ваши литературные знакомства У меня тут письмо в газету Вы не присядете на минутку я бы допечатал конецОн подошел к письменному столу у окна подвинул дважды свой стул и перечел несколько слов с листа заправленного в пишущую машинку Присаживайтесь Прошу меня извинить  сказал он через плечо  Законы здравого смысла  Одну минуткуВглядываясь изпод косматых бровей в черновик возле своего локтя и бормоча про себя он принялся тукать по тугим клавишам машинки медленно иногда отдуваясь когда приходилось возвращать валик чтобы стереть опечаткуСтивен бесшумно уселся в присутствии августейшей особы Развешанные по стенам в рамках почтительно застыли изображенья канувших в Лету лошадей уставив кверху кроткие морды Отпор лорда Гастингса Выстрел герцога Вестминстерского Цейлон герцога Бофора взявший Парижский приз в году На седлах легкие жокеи в чутком ожиданье сигнала Он следил за их состязанием поставив на королевские цвета и сливал свои крики с криками канувших в Лету толп Точка  дал указание клавишам мистер Дизи  Однако скорейшее разрешение этого важного вопроса Куда Крэнли меня привел чтобы разом

жуликов мимо игроков в кости спешили мы вслед за копытами картузами и камзолами и мимо мяснолицей зазнобы мясника жадно всосавшейся в апельсинПронзительные крики донеслись с поля и трель свисткаЕще гол Я среди них в свалке их борющихся тел на турнире жизни Ты хочешь сказать тот маменькин сынок заморыш со слегка осовелым видом Турниры Время отражает толчок толчком каждый раз Турниры грязь и рев битв застывшая предсмертная блевотина убитых вопль копий наживленных кровавыми человечьими кишками Готово  произнес мистер Дизи вставая с местаОн подошел к столу скрепляя вместе свои листки Стивен тоже поднялся Я тут все выразил в двух словах  сказал мистер Дизи  Это насчет эпидемии ящура Взгляните бегло пожалуйста Вопрос бесспорныйПозволю себе вторгнуться на ваши уважаемые столбцы Пресловутая политика невмешательства которая столь часто в нашей истории Наша скототорговляСудьба всех наших старинных промыслов Ливерпульская клика похоронившая проект Голуэйского порта Европейские конфликты Перевозки зерна через узкие проливы Завидная невозмутимость ведомства земледелия Не грех вспомнить классиков Кассандра От женщины не блиставшей добродетельюПерейдем к сути дела Я выражаюсь напрямик вы согласны  спросил мистер Дизи у читавшего СтивенаЭпидемия ящура Известен как препарат Коха Сыворотка и вирус Процент вакцинированных лошадей Эпизоотии Императорские конюшни в Мюрцштеге Нижняя Австрия Квалифицированные ветеринары Мистер Генри Блэквуд Прайс Любезное предложение беспристрастной проверки Законы здравого смысла Вопрос чрезвычайно важен Взять быка за рога в прямом и переносном смысле Позвольте поблагодарить за предоставленную возможность Я хочу чтобы это напечатали и прочли  сказал мистер Дизи  Вот увидите при следующей же вспышке они наложат эмбарго на ирландский скот А болезнь излечима И ее лечат Как пишет мне родственник Блэквуд Прайс в Австрии специалисты научились бороться с ней и надежно вылечивают Они предлагают приехать к нам Я пробую найти ходы в ведомстве Сейчас попытаюсь привлечь газеты Но всюду столько препятствий столько интриг закулисных происков чтоПодняв указательный палец он прежде чем продолжать погрозил им стариковато в воздухе Помяните мои слова мистер Дедал  сказал он  Англия в когтях у евреев Финансы пресса на всех самых высоких постах А это признак упадка нации Всюду где они скапливаются они высасывают из нации соки Я это наблюдаю не первый год Ясно как божий день еврейские торгаши уже ведут свою разрушительную работу Старая Англия умираетОн быстро отошел в сторону и глаза его засветились голубизной оказавшись в столбе солнечного света Он оглянулся по сторонам Умирает  повторил он  если уже не умерлаИ крики шлюх глухой поройБритания ткут саван твойГлаза его расширенные представшим видением смотрели сурово сквозь солнечный столб в котором он еще оставался Но торгаш  сказал Стивен  это тот кто дешево покупает и дорого продает будь он еврей или не еврей разве нет Они согрешили против света  внушительно произнес мистер Дизи  У них в глазах тьма Вот потому им и суждено быть вечными скитальцами по сей деньНа ступенях парижской биржи златокожие люди показывают курс на пальцах с драгоценными перстнями Гусиный гогот Развязно и шумно толпятся в храме под неуклюжими цилиндрами зреют замыслы и аферы Все не их и одежда и речь и жесты Их выпуклые медлительные глаза противоречили их словам а жесты были пылки но незлобивы хотя они знали об окружающей вражде и знали что их старания тщетны Тщетно богатеть запасать Время размечет все Богатство запасенное у дороги его разграбят и пустят порукам Глаза их знали годы скитаний и знали смиренные о бесчестье их крови А кто нет  спросил Стивен Что вы хотите сказать  не понял мистер ДизиОн сделал шаг вперед и остановился у стола челюсть косо отвисла в недоумении И это мудрая старость Он ждет пока я ему скажу История  произнес Стивен  это кошмар от которого я пытаюсь проснутьсяНа поле снова крики мальчишек Трель свистка гол А вдруг этот кошмар даст тебе пинка в зад Пути Господни неисповедимы  сказал мистер Дизи  Вся история движется к единой великой цели явлению БогаСтивен ткнув пальцем в окошко проговорил Вот БогУрра Эх фью фьюйть Как это  переспросил мистер Дизи Крик на улице  отвечал Стивен пожав плечамиМистер Дизи опустил взгляд и некоторое время подержал пальцами переносицу Потом поднял взгляд и переносицу отпустил Я счастливей вас  сказал он  Мы совершили много ошибок много грехов Женщина принесла грех в мир Изза женщины не блиставшей добродетелью Елены сбежавшей от Менелая греки десять лет осаждали Трою Неверная жена впервые привела чужеземцев на наши берега жена Макморро и ее любовник ОРурк принц Брефни И Парнелла погубила женщина Много ошибок Много неудач но только не главный грех Сейчас на склоне дней своих я еще борец И я буду бороться за правое дело до концаПраво свое волю свою Ольстер добудет в боюСтивен поднял руку с листками Так значит сэр  начал он Сдается мне  сказал мистер Дизи  что вы не слишком задержитесь на этой работе Вы не родились учителем Хотя возможно я ошибаюсь Скорее я ученик  сказал СтивенА чему тебе тут учиться Мистер Дизи покачал головой Как знать Ученик должен быть смиренным Но жизнь  великий учительСтивен опять зашуршал листками Так насчет этого  начал он Да да  сказал мистер Дизи  Я дал вам два экземпляра Желательно чтобы напечатали сразуТелеграф Айриш Хомстед Я попробую  сказал Стивен  и завтра вам сообщу Я немного знаком с двумя редакторами Вот и хорошо  живо откликнулся мистер Дизи  Вчера вечером я написал письмо мистеру Филду ЧП Сегодня в гостинице Городской герб собрание Ассоциации скотопромышленников Я его попросил огласить мое письмо в этом собрании А вы попробуйте через ваши газетыЭто какие Ивнинг телеграф Вот и хорошо  повторил мистер Дизи  Не будем же терять времени Мне еще надо написать ответ тому родственнику Всего доброго  сказал Стивен пряча листки в карман  Благодарю вас Не за что  отозвался мистер Дизи принимаясь рыться в бумагах у себя на столе  Я хоть и стар сам люблю скрестить с вами копья Всего доброго сэр  повторил Стивен кланяясь его склоненной спинеОн вышел на крыльцо через открытые двери и зашагал под деревьями по гравийной дорожке слыша звонкие голоса и треск клюшек Львы покойно дремали на постаментах когда он проходил мимо через ворота беззубые чудища Что ж помогу ему в его баталии Маллиган даст мне новое прозвище быколюбивый бард Мистер ДедалНагоняет меня Надеюсь не с новым письмом Одну минутку Да сэр  отозвался Стивен поворачивая обратно к воротамМистер Дизи остановился запыхавшись дыша прерывисто и тяжело Я только хотел добавить  проговорил он  Утверждают что Ирландия к своей чести это единственная страна где никогда не преследовали евреев Вы это знаете Нет А вы знаете почему Лицо его сурово нахмурилось от яркого света Почему же сэр  спросил Стивен пряча улыбку Потому что их сюда никогда не пускали  торжественно объявил мистер ДизиКом смеха и кашля вылетел у него из горла потянув за собой трескучую цепь мокроты Он быстро повернул назад кашляя и смеясь размахивая руками над головой Их никогда сюда не пускали  еще раз прокричал он сквозь смех топая по гравию дорожки затянутыми в гетры ногами  Вот почемуСквозь ажур листьев солнце рассыпало на его велемудрые плечи пляшущие золотые звездочки и монеткиЭпизод Неотменимая модальность зримого Хотя бы это если не больше говорят моей мысли мои глаза Я

непрозрачное Куда пролезет вся пятерня это ворота куда нет  дверь Закрой глаза и смотриСтивен закрыв глаза прислушался как хрустят хрупкие ракушки и водоросли у него под ногами Так или иначе ты сквозь это идешь Иду шажок за шажком За малый шажок времени сквозь малый шажок пространстваПять шесть это  Совершенно верно и это  неотменимая модальность слышимого Открой глаза Нет Господи Если я свалюсь с

помчался как заяц уши назад погнавшись за тенью низко летящей чайки Резкий свист мужчины ударил в его вислые ухи Он повернул и помчался назад приблизился мелькающие лапы перешли на рысцу В червленом поле олень бегущий цвета природного без рогов У кружевной кромки прилива остановился упершись передними копытами насторожив уши к морюЗадравши морду облаял шумные волны стада моржей Они подползали к

мешки вытащили вышли обратно Пес с визгом подбежал к ним вскинулся на них лапами потом опустил лапы на песок потом снова вскинул их на хозяев с немою медвежеватою лаской Оставленный без взаимности он потрусил следом за ними на сухое и тряпка волчьего языка краснопыхтела из пастиПятнистое его тело трусцой выдвинулось вперед потом вдруг припустило телячьим галопом Собачий труп лежал у него на пути Он остановился обнюхал обошел кругом братец обнюхал тщательней сделал еще один обход быстро пособачьи обнюхивая всю грязную шкуру дохлого пса Песий череп песий нюх глаза в землю движется к единой великой цели Эх песбедолага Здесь лежит тело псабедолаги Падаль Живо оттуда псинаПрисмирев от окрика он вернулся и несильный пинок босой хозяйской ноги швырнул его сжавшегося на лету за грядку песка Подался обратно описав вороватую кривую Не видит меня У края дамбы задержался посуетился обнюхал валун и помочился на него задрав заднюю ногуПотрусил вперед задрал снова заднюю ногу и быстро коротко помочился на необнюханный валун Простые радости бедняков Потом задние лапы стали раскидывать песок потом передние принялись грести рыть Чтото он тут хоронит бабку свою Он вгрызался в песок разгребая раскидывая остановился прислушался снова принялся рыть яростными когтями но вскоре перестал леопард пантера зачатый в прелюбодействе пожирающий мертвыхПосле того как он меня разбудил этой ночью тот же

Желающие пусть смотрятПозади Кажется ктото естьОн обернулся через плечо взирая назад Пронося в воздухе высокие перекладины трех мачт с парусами убранными по трем крестам салингов домой против течения безмолвно скользя безмолвный корабльЭпизод Мистер Леопольд Блум с удовольствием ел внутренние органы животных и птиц Он любил жирный суп из гусиных потрохов пупки с орехами жареное фаршированное сердце печенку поджаренную ломтиками в сухарях жареные наважьи молоки Всего же больше любил он бараньи почки на углях которые оставляли во рту тонкий привкус с отдаленным ароматом мочиПочки не выходили из головы у него пока он стараясь тихо ступать собирал для нее завтрак на горбатом подносе На кухне было прохладно даже зябко хотя за окном стояло летнее погожее утро Это както еще разжигало аппетитУголь в очаге разгоралсяХлеб с маслом еще ломтик  три четыре  и хватит Она не любит когда гора на тарелке Хватит Отойдя от подноса он снял с полки чайник и поставил на огонь сбоку Чайник сел тусклой глыбой выставив торчком хобот Скоро поспеет Хорошо Во рту сухоКошка ходила на прямых лапах вокруг ножки стола хвост кверху Мррау А вот ты где  сказал мистер Блум оборачиваясь от очагаКошка мяукнула в ответ и продолжала путь вокруг ножки ступая на прямых лапах мяукая Вот так же она разгуливает по моему письменному столуМурр Почеши за ушком МуррМистер Блум с добродушным интересом поглядел на черное гибкое существоЛадный вид шерстка гладкая и блестит белая пуговка под хвостом глаза зеленые светятся Он нагнулся к ней упершись ладонями в колени Молочка киске Мррау  громко мяукнула онаГоворят они глупые Они понимают что мы говорим лучше чем мы их понимаем Вот эта все что хочет поймет И злопамятная Интересно каким я ей кажусь Вышиной с башню Нет она ведь может на меня вспрыгнуть А цыплят боится  поддразнил он ее  Боится цыпцыпочек В жизни не видал такой глупой кискиЖестокая Это у них в природе Странно что мыши при этом не пищат Как будто им нравится Мгррау  мяукнула она громчеГлаза ее жадные полуприкрытые от стыда моргнули и жалобно протяжно мяукнув она выставила свои молочнобелые зубки Он видел как сужаются от жадности черные щелки ее зрачков превращая глаза в зеленые камешки Подойдя к шкафу он взял кувшин свеженаполненный разносчиком от Ханлона налил на блюдце теплопузырчатого молока и осторожно поставил блюдце на пол Мяв  взвизгнула она кидаясь к едеОн смотрел как металлически поблескивают ее усы в тусклом свете и как трижды примерившись она легко принялась лакать Правда или нет что если усы подрезать не сможет охотиться Почему бы Может кончики светят в темноте Или служат как щупики возможноОн слушал как она лакает Яичницу с ветчиной не стоит В такую сушь яйца нехорошо Хочется свежей чистой воды Баранью почку у Бакли сегодня тоже не стоит четверг Обжарить в масле  и с перчиком Лучше свиную почку у Длугача Пока чайник не закипел Она лакала все медленней потом вылизала блюдце Почему у них языки такие шершавые Лакать удобней сплошь пористые в дырочках Ничего она тут не слопает Он поглядел кругомНичегоТихо поскрипывая подошвами он поднялся по лестнице в переднюю и стал у дверей спальни Может она захочет чегонибудь повкусней Обычно предпочитает небольшие бутербродики утром Но всетаки  вдругОн проговорил негромко стоя в пустой передней Я схожу за угол Через минуту вернусьУслышал звуки своего голоса добавил Тебе чегонибудь не захватить к завтракуМягкий и сонный голос пробормотал в ответ НнеНет Ничего не хочет Затем послышался глубокий парной вздох еще мягче это она повернулась в постели и разболтанные медные кольца звякнули Надо чтоб подтянули Жаль Из Гибралтара неблизкий путьСовсем забыла испанский и ту малость что знала Интересно сколько папаша за нее заплатил Фасон старинный Ах да конечно С губернаторского

дальновидностьРука его сняла шляпу с крючка над толстым пальто с его монограммой и над ношеным плащом с распродажи забытых вещей Марка картинка а сзади клей Наверняка из офицеров многие этим промышляют Что говоритьПропотевшее клеймо на дне шляпы молча сообщило ему Плестоу шляпылю Он заглянул воровато за кожаный ободок Белая полоска бумаги Надежное местоНа крыльце он ощупал брючный карман тут ли ключ Нету В тех что оставил Надо бы взять Картофелина на месте Гардероб скрипит Не стоит ее тревожить Была совсем сонная Он притянул дверь к себе осторожно еще чутьчуть пока защитная полоска внизу не прикрыла порожек усталым векомНа вид закрыто Обойдется до моего приходаОн перешел на солнечную сторону минуя открытый люк погреба в семьдесят пятом доме Солнце приближалось к шпилю церкви святого Георгия Похоже день будет жаркий Когда в этом черном особенно чувствуешь Черное проводит отражает а может преломляет тепло Но в светлом костюме никак нельзя Не пикник От ощущения блаженного тепла глаза его часто жмурились фургон из пекарни Боланда лотки наш насущный но ей вчерашний больше по вкусу пироги горячая хрустящая корочка Чувствуешь себя помолодевшим Гденибудь на востоке вот

инструменте как же он называется цимбалы Идешь дальшеА может быть там все и не так Начитался этой ерунды по следам солнца С сияющим солнцем на титуле Он усмехнулся самодовольно Как сказал Артур Гриффит про ту заставку над передовицей во Фримене солнце гомруля восходит на северозападе из переулка за Ирландским банком Он длил усмешку В духе еврейского остроумия солнце гомруля восходит на северозападеОн приблизился к пивной Ларри ОРурка Изпод решетки погреба плыли влажные испарения портера Через раскрытые двери бара несло имбирем бросовым чаем и бисквитной трухой Но заведение стоящее как раз у трамвайного кольца Скажем Маколи там подальше гиблое место А если бы провели линию вдоль Северной окружной от скотного рынка к набережным цена тут же бы подскочилаЛысая голова над занавеской Прижимист старый пройдоха Насчет рекламы с ним бесполезно Что ж в своем деле ему видней Вон он наш бравый Ларри без пиджака прислонясь к мешкам с сахаром созерцает как прислужник в фартуке орудует с ведром и шваброй Саймон Дедал его отлично копирует как он щурит свои глазенки Знаете я вам что скажу Что же мистер ОРурк Знаете для японцев русские  только закуска к завтракуСтоп надо перекинуться

Пятнадцать помножить на Цифры ускользая вертелись в его мозгу он недовольно прогнал их Глянцевитые кольца туго начиненные мясом насыщали его взгляд и он безмятежно вдыхал пряный и парной запах вареной свиной кровиПочка сочила кровь на блюдо с рисунком из ивовых ветвей последняя Он стоял у прилавка следом за соседской прислугой Возьмет ее или нет Она вычитывала по пунктам держа в руке списочек Руки потрескались от стирки И полтора фунта сосисок Денни Взгляд его приковали мощные бедраВудс его фамилия Чем занимается неизвестно Жена уже старовата Свежая кровь Ухажеров не разрешают Руки крепкие

поутру на скотном рынке ревут быки клейменые овцы в загонах шлепается навоз скотоводы чавкают по грязи в кованых сапогах держа неошкуренные прутья похлопывают скотину по мясистым задам гляди  первый

стопки завернул первосортные сосиски осклабил медную рожу Пожалте миссС дерзкой ухмылкой она протянула ему монету в своей мощной руке Благодарим мисс Сдача шиллинг три пенса А вам сэрМистер Блум не

ярком солнце и двинулась ленивой походкой направо Он вздохнул выпустив воздух через нос они никогда не понимают Руки огрубели от стирки И на ногах ногти с наростами Изодранная темная власяница защищает все подступы Укол от ее равнодушия разгорелся в груди у него до слабого наслаждения Не тебе другому какойто констебль на досуге тискал ее на Экклслейн Они любят когда есть за что

сумрак приблизился к ее растрепанной голове Кому там письмаОн поглядел на них Моллингар Милли Письмо мне от Милли  сказал он следя за своим голосом  а тебе открытка И письмо тебеОн положил ее письмо и открытку на саржевое покрывало у сгиба ее колен Тебе шторы поднятьПодтягивая осторожно шторы до половины он видел через плечо как она глянула на конверт и сунула его под подушку Хватит так  спросил он оборачиваясьОна читала открытку приподнявшись на локте Посылка дошла уже  сказала онаОн не уходил она отложила открытку и медленно с блаженным вздохом опять свернулась клубком Давайка чай поскорей  поторопила она  Совсем горло пересохло Чайник уже кипитОднако он задержался убрать со стула полосатая нижняя юбка нечистое мятое белье и взяв все в охапку положил в ноги постелиКогда он был уже на ступеньках она окликнула Польди Что Ошпарь заварной чайникВполне закипел пар валит из носика Он ошпарил и сполоснул заварной чайник насыпал четыре полных ложечки чаю и наклонив большой чайник залил чай водой Поставив чай настояться он отодвинул большой чайник в сторону и вдавив сковороду прямо в жар угля смотрел как масло плавится и скользит по ней Когда он развернул почку кошка жадно мяукнула рядом с ним Если ей давать много мяса не будет мышей ловить Говорят они не едят свинину Кошер Он бросил ей окровавленную обертку и положил почку в шипящее масло Перцу Он взял щепотку из выщербленной рюмки для яйца посыпал круговыми движениямиПотом он распечатал письмо скользнул глазами по всей странице Спасибо  новая беретка  мистер Коклан  пикник на озере Оул  студент  приморские красотки Буяна

поддел почку вилкой перевернул потом поставил заварной чайник на поднос Горб стал пружинить когда он поднял поднос Все взял Бутерброды  четыре сахар ложечка сливки Так Он направился с подносом наверх продев большой палец в ручку чайникаТолкнув дверь коленом он вошел и поставил поднос на стул у изголовья постели До чего же ты долго  сказала онаМедь задребезжала когда она проворно приподнялась упершись локтем в подушку Он спокойно смотрел на ее полные формы и на ложбинку между мягких больших грудей круглившихся в ночной рубашке как козье вымя Тепло шедшее от ее тела мешалось в воздухе с душистым запахом наливаемого чаяКраешек распечатанного конверта торчал изпод примятой подушки Уже уходя он остановился поправить покрывало А от кого письмо  спросил онДерзкий почерк Мэрион Да от

Должно быть упала  сказала онаОн поглядел по сторонам     Интересно правильно ли она произносит  На кровати нигдеЗавалилась кудато Он нагнулся и приподнял подзор Упавшая книга распласталась на пузе ночного горшка в оранжевую полоску Дайка мне  сказала она  Я тут отметила Хотела одно слово спроситьСделав глоток из чашки которую держала за неручку и обтерев бесцеремонно пальцы об одеяло она принялась водить по странице шпилькой покуда не нашла слово Метим что  переспросил он Вот это  сказала она  Что это значитНаклонившись он прочел подле холеного ногтя на ее большом пальце Метемпсихоз Вотвот С чем это вообще едят Метемпсихоз  начал он морща лоб  это греческое Из греческого языка Это означает переселение душ Ну и дичь  оценила она  А теперь скажи попростомуОн улыбнулся искоса глянув в ее смеющиеся глаза Все те же молодые глаза Первый вечер после игры в шарады Долфинсбарн Он полистал замусоленные страницы Руби  краса арены Ага картинка Свирепый итальянец с хлыстом А это видно Руби краса чего там положено голая на полу Милостиво дали прикрыться Злодей Маффей остановился и с проклятиями отшвырнул прочь свою жертву Всюду жестокость Одурманенные звери Трапеция в цирке Хенглера Не мог смотреть отвернулся А толпа глазеет Ты там надрывай силы а мы животики себе надорвем Их целые семьиВдалбливают им смолоду они и метемпсихозят Будто бы мы живем после смерти Души наши Будто душа человека когда он умрет Дигнама вот душа Ты ее уже кончила  спросил он Да  сказала она  Совсем никакой клубнички Она что все время любила того первого Я даже не заглядывал Хочешь другую Ага Принеси еще Поль де Кока Такое симпатичное имяОна подлила себе чаю глядя сбоку на струйкуНадо продлить ту книжку из библиотеки на Кейплстрит а то напишут Карни моему поручителю Перевоплощение вот то самое слово Некоторые верят  начал он  что после смерти мы будем снова жить в другом теле и что уже жили раньше Это называется перевоплощение Что все мы уже жили раньше тысячи лет назад на земле или на какойнибудь другой планете Они считают мы забыли про это А некоторые говорят будто помнят свои прошлые жизниГустые сливки вились витками у нее в чашке Как бы ей лучше запомнить это слово метемпсихоз Хорошо бы пример ПримерНад кроватью Купанье нимфы Приложение к пасхальному номеру Фотокартинок роскошный шедевр великолепные краски Как чай до того как налили молока Похожа на нее с распущенными волосами только потоньше За рамку отдано три и шесть Она сказала над кроватью будет красивоОбнаженные нимфы  Греция  а вот и пример  все люди что тогда жилиОн перелистал страницы обратно Метемпсихоз  сказал он  так это называли древние греки Они верили что человек может превратиться в животное или скажем в деревоЧто они называли нимфами напримерОна перестала вдруг помешивать ложечкой Смотрела прямо перед собой и втягивала воздух округлившимися ноздрями Горелым пахнет  сказала она  У тебя там ничего на огне Почка  возопил онОн сунул не глядя книжку во внутренний карман и стукнувшись носком ноги о хромой комод ринулся на запах сбегая по лестнице прыжками всполошенного аиста Пахучий дым поднимался сердитой струйкой с одного края сковороды Поддев почку вилкой он отодрал ее и перевернул как на спину черепаху Совсем чутьчуть подгорела Он перебросил ее на тарелку и полил оставшимся бурым сокомТеперь чайку Он уселся отрезал ломоть хлеба намазал маслом Срезал пригорелую мякоть и бросил кошке Наконец отправил кусочек на вилке в рот и принялся жевать разборчиво смакуя упругое аппетитное мясо В самый разГлоток чаю Потом он нарезал хлеб на кубики обмакнул один в соус и сунул в рот Так что там у нее про студента и про пикник Он разложил около себя листок с письмом и медленно стал читать жуя макая кубики в соус и отправляя их в ротДражайший папулькаПреогромнейшее спасибо за твой чудный

Передай ему от меня что Миллиглупышка ему шлет привет Пора кончать письмо с любовьютвоя любящая дочь Милли Извини за каракули очень спешу Пока МПятнадцать вчера Как сошлось и число пятнадцатое Первый день рождения в чужих местах Разлука Помню летнее утро когда она родиласьПомчался за миссис Торнтон на Дензиллстрит Бодрая старушка Куче младенцев помогла явиться на свет Она с первой минуты знала бедняжке Руди не жить Авось Бог милостив сэр А сама уже знала Остался бы жить сейчас было бы одиннадцатьОтсутствующим печальным взглядом он смотрел на постскриптум Извини за каракули Спешу Внизу пианино Выпорхнула из гнезда Сцена с ней изза браслета в кафе  Не стала есть пирожные не глядела не разговаривала Дерзкая девчонка Он обмакнул в соус еще кубик хлеба машинально продолжая доедать почку Двенадцать и шесть в неделю Не густоНо могло и похуже быть Мюзикхолл скажем Студент Он глотнул остывшего чаю запить еду Потом опять перечел письмо дваждыНу ладно она умеет вести себя осмотрительно А вдруг нет Оставь ничего еще не случилось Все возможно конечно Во всяком случае обождемБесенок Вечно бегом по лестнице ножки тонкие стройные СудьбаНаступает зрелость Кокетка  страшнаяОн улыбнулся в кухонное окно с теплотой с тревогой Однажды вижу ее на улице щиплет себя за щеки чтоб разрумянились Слегка малокровная Поздно отняли от груди В тот день на Короле Эрина вокруг маяка Киш Старую посудину качало вовсю А ей хоть бы что Шарф по ветру светлоголубой распущенные волосы по ветруЩечки в ямочках кудряшкиВскружат голову бедняжкеПриморские красотки Распечатанный конверт Руки в брюки и распевает ни дать ни взять извозчик навеселе Друг дома Вскрюжат  он так поетОсвещенный пирс летний вечер звуки оркестраДо чего ж милы и кроткиТе приморские красоткиИ Милли тоже Первые юные поцелуи Как давно минуло Миссис МэрионСейчас снова легла читает перебирая прядки волос заплетая их улыбаясьСожаление и потерянность нарастая смутной волной расползались вниз по спине Да случится Помешать Бесполезно что сделаешь Девичьи губы нежные легкие Случится то же Он чувствовал как волна потерянности охватывает его Бесполезно тут чтото делать Губы целуют целующие целуемые Женские губы полные клейкиеЛучше пусть там где она сейчас подальше И занята Хотела собаку от нечего делать Можно бы туда съездить На табельные дни в августе всего два и шесть в оба конца Но это через полтора месяца Можно бы устроить бесплатный проезд как журналисту Или через МаккояКошка вылизав свою шерстку вернулась к обертке в кровяных пятнах потыкала ее носом и пошла к двери Оглянулась на него мяукнула Хочет выйти Жди перед дверью  когданибудь отворится Пусть подождет Както занервничала Электричество Гроза в воздухе И умывала ушко спиной к огнюОн ощутил сытую тяжесть  потом легкие позывы в желудке Поднялся изза стола распуская брючный ремень Кошка настойчиво мяукнула Мяу  передразнил он  Обождешь пока я сам соберусьТяжесть день будет жаркий Лень подыматься на площадку по лестницеГазетку В сортире он любил читать Надеюсь никакая макака туда не забредет пока яВ ящике стола ему попался старый номер Осколков Свернув он сунул его под мышку подошел к двери и отворил Кошка кинулась мягкими прыжками наверх А вон ты куда  свернуться на постели клубкомПрислушавшись он услыхал ее голос Поди сюда кисонька Ну подиОн вышел с черного хода во двор постоял прислушиваясь к звукам соседнего двора Все тихо Может быть вешают белье Королевна в парке вешает белье Славное утроОн наклонился взглянуть на чахлые кустики мяты посаженной вдоль стеныПоставить беседку здесь Бобы дикий виноград И надо везде удобрить земля плохая Бурая корка серы Почва всегда такая без навоза Кухонные помои Перегной  что бы это за штука У соседей куры вот их помет  отличное удобрение Но самое лучшее от скота особенно если кормили жмыхами Сухой навоз Лучшее средство для чистки лайковых перчаток Грязь очищает И зола Надо тут все переделать В том углу горох Салат Всегда будет свежая зелень Но с этими садиками свои неудобства Тот шмель или овод в Духов деньОн двинулся по дорожке А где моя шляпа кстати Должно быть повесил обратно на крючок Или оставил наверху Вот номер совсем не помню На вешалке в прихожей слишком полно Четыре зонтика ее плащ Подбирал письма У Дрейго колокольчик звонил Как странно именно в этот момент я думал Его волосы каштановые напомаженные над воротничком Свежевымыт и свежепричесан Не знаю успею ли зайти в баню Тарастрит Тип что у них за кассой устроил побег Джеймсу Стивенсу Такие слухи ОБрайенКаким он басом говорит этот Длугач Агенда  как там Пожалте миссЭнтузиастОн отворил толкнув носком ветхую дверь сортира Смотри чтобы не запачкать брюки потом на похороны Вошел пригнув голову стараясь не задеть о низкий косяк Оставив дверь приоткрытой посреди пыльной паутины и вони заплесневелой хлорки не спеша отстегнул подтяжки Перед тем как усесться бросил через щель взгляд на соседское окно А король на троне пишет манифест Никого нетРаскорячившись на позорном стуле он развернул журнал на оголенных коленях и стал читать Чтонибудь новенькое и полегче Не торопись особоПопридержи Наш премированный осколок Мастерский удар Мэтчена Автор  мистер Филип Бьюфой член лондонского Клуба театралов Гонорар по гинее за столбец Три с половиной Три фунта три Три фунта тринадцать и шестьОн мирно прочел сдерживая себя первый столбец затем уступая но еще придерживая начал второй На середине окончательно уступив он дал кишечнику опорожниться свободно продолжая мирно неторопливо читать вчерашний легкий запор прошел без следа Авось не слишком толсто геморрой снова не разойдется Нет самый раз Ага Уфф Для страдающих запором одна таблетка святой коры В жизни может такое быть Это не тронуло и не взволновало его но в общем было бойко и живо Теперь что хочешь печатают На безрыбье Он читал дальше спокойно сидя над своими подымавшимися миазмами Бойко что говорить Мэтчен часто вспоминает свой мастерский удар покоривший сердце смеющейся чаровницы которая нынеМораль в конце и в начале Рука об руку Лихо Он снова окинул взглядом прочитанное и выпуская ровную заключительную струю благодушно позавидовал мистеру Бьюфою который сочинил это и получил гонорар в размере трех фунтов тринадцати шиллингов и шести пенсовЯ б тоже мог коечто накропать Авторы  мистер и миссис ЛМБлумПридумать историйку на тему пословицы Какой только Както пробовал записывать на манжете что она говорит пока собирается Не люблю собираться вместе Порезался бреясь Покусывает нижнюю губку застегивая крючки на платье Я засекаю время  Робертс тебе заплатил уже  А в чем была Грета Конрой  Чего меня угораздило купить такую гребенку  С этой капусты меня всегда пучит Заметит пылинки на обуви  потрет каждую туфельку об чулки на икрах обе по очереди так ловкоНаутро после благотворительного бала когда оркестр Мэя исполнял танец часов Понкьелли Объяснял ей утренние часы потом день вечер потом ночные часы Она чистила зубы Это была первая встреча У нее голова кружилась Пощелкивали пластинки веера А этот Бойлан богатый Да он со средствами А что Я во время танца заметила у него пахнет чемто приятным изо рта Тогда не стоит мурлыкать Надо бы намекнуть В последний раз какаято странная музыка Зеркало было в темноте Она взяла свое маленькое потерла о кофточку на грудях нервно так и заколыхались Потом смотрелась Нахмуренный взгляд Чегото там такое не сладилосьВечерние часы девушки в серых газовых платьях Потом ночные часы в черном с кинжалами в полумасках Это поэтично розовое потом золотое потом серое потом черное И в то же время как в жизни День потом ночьОн смело оторвал половину премированного рассказа и подтерся ею Потом поднял брюки застегнул надел подтяжки Потянул на себя кривую шаткую дверь сортира и вышел из полумрака на воздухПри ярком свете облегченный и освеженный в членах он тщательно осмотрел свои черные брюки их обшлага колени и за коленями Во сколько похороны Надо уточнить по газетеМрачные скрипучие звуки высоко в воздухе Колокола церкви святого Георгия Они отбивали время гулкий мрачный металлЭй  гей Эй  гейЭй  гей Эй  гейЭй  гей Эй  гейБез четверти Потом снова по воздуху донесся обертон терцияБедный ДигнамЭпизод По набережной сэра Джона Роджерсона шагал собранным шагом мистер Блум мимо ломовых подвод мимо маслобойни Лиска льняное масло жмыхи мимо Уиндмилллейн и мимо почтовотелеграфного отделения На этот адрес тоже было бы можно И мимо богадельни для моряков С шумливой утренней набережной он повернул на Лаймстрит У коттеджей Брэди шатался мальчишкасвалочник примкнув ведерко с требухой сосал жеваный окурокДевчонка помладше с изъеденным коростой лбом глазела на него вяло придерживая ржавый обруч Сказать ему если курит  перестанет расти Да ладно оставь в покое И так житье у него не рай Ждать у трактира тащить папашу домой Тять ну пойдем мамка ждет Как раз затишье не будет много народу Он перешел Таунсендстрит миновал хмурый фасад Бетеля Да ЭльЕго дом Алеф Бет Потом похоронное бюро Николса В одиннадцать Времени хватит Ейей Корни Келлехер подкинул эту работенку ОНилу Напевает прикрыв глаза Корни Повстречал я в темном парке Одну пташку Возле арки Работает на полицию Свое имя мне сказала и мои труляля труляля там там Ясное дело он подкинул Схоронитека по дешевке в сухомнемазаном И мои труляля труляля труляля труляляНа Уэстлендроу он остановился перед витриной Белфастской и Восточной чайной компании прочел ярлыки на пачках в свинцовой фольге отборная смесь высшее качество семейный чай Жарко становится Чай Надо бы им разжиться у Тома Кернана Хотя похороны  неподходящий случай Покуда глаза его невозмутимо читали он снял не торопясь шляпу вдохнув запах своего брильянтина и плавным неторопливым жестом провел правой рукой по лбу и по волосам Какое жаркое утро Глаза изпод приспущенных век отыскали чуть заметную выпуклость на кожаном ободке внутри его шляпылюВот она Правая рука погрузилась в тулью Пальцы живо нащупали за ободком карточку переместили в карман жилетаДо того жарко Правая рука еще раз еще неторопливей

секунду Закон падения тел в секунду за секунду Все они падают на землюЗемля Сила земного тяготения вот это что такое весОн повернулся и неспешно перешел через улицу Как это она вышагивала с сосисками Примерно так вот На ходу он вынул из бокового кармана сложенный Фримен развернул его скатал в трубку по длине и начал похлопывать себя по брюкам при каждом неспешном шаге Беззаботный вид заглянул просто так В секунду за секунду Это значит в секунду на каждую секунду С тротуара он метнул цепкий взгляд в двери почты Ящик для опоздавших писем Опускать сюда Никого ПошелОн протянул свою карточку через медную решетку Нет ли для меня писем  спросил онПока почтовая барышня смотрела в ячейке он разглядывал плакат вербовочной службы солдаты всех родов войск на параде и держа конец своей трубки у самых ноздрей вдыхал запах свежей типографской краскиНет наверно ответа В последний раз зашел слишком далекоБарышня сквозь решетку подала ему карточку и письмо Он поблагодарил бросив быстрый взгляд на конверт заадресованный на машинкеЗдесьПочтовое Отделение Уэстлендроу до востребованияГенри Флауэру эсквайруОтветила всетаки Сунув письмо и карточку в боковой карман он вернулся к параду всех родов

никогда не наденет Масон даБеспечной походкой он вышел с почты и повернул направо Говорильня как будто этим чтото исправишь Рука его опустилась в карман указательный палец просунулся под клапан конверта и вскрыл его несколькими рывками Не думаю чтобы женщины особо обращали внимание Пальцы вытащили письмо и скомкали в кармане конверт Чтото подколото наверно фотография Прядь волос НетМаккой Как бы поскорей отвязаться Одна помеха Чужое присутствие только злит когда ты Здравствуйте Блум Куда направляетесь Здравствуйте Маккой Да так никуда Как самочувствие Прекрасно А вы как Скрипим

спокойно стояла в ожидании а мужчина муж брат похож на нее искал мелочь в карманахПальто модного фасона с круглым воротником слишком теплое для такой погоды на вид как байка Стоит в небрежной позе руки в карманы накладные сейчас так носят Как та надменная дамочка на игре в поло Все женщины свысока пока не раскусишь Красив телом красив и деломНеприступны до первого приступа Достойная госпожа и

Рад это слышать старина А кто это все устраиваетМиссис Мэрион Блум Еще не вставала Королева в спальне хлеб с вареньем Не за книгой Замусоленные карты одни картинки разложены по семеркам вдоль бедра На

пошел в комнату и не видел его лицо В тот день Боже Боже Эх Кто знает быть может так было лучше для негоМистер Блум завернул за угол прошел мимо понурых одров на извозчичьей стоянке Что толку об этом думать Пора для торбы с овсом Лучше бы я не встретил его этого МаккояОн подошел ближе услышал хруст золоченого овса жующие мирно челюстиИх выпуклые оленьи глаза смотрели на него когда он шел мимо

корм и кров обеспечены Холощеные черный обрубок болтается как резиновый между ляжками Что ж может они и так счастливы На вид славная смирная животинка Но как примутся ржать это бывает невыносимоОн вынул из кармана письмо и положил в газету которую нес Можно здесь натолкнуться на нее В переулке надежнейОн миновал Приют извозчика Странная у извозчика жизнь тудасюда в любую погоду в любое место на время или в один конец все не по своей воле    Люблю иногда их угостить сигареткой Общительны Катит мимо покрикивает на лету Он замурлыкал    Ла ла дала ла лаОн повернул на Камберлендстрит и пройдя несколько шагов остановился под стеной станции Никого Лесосклад Мида Кучи досок Развалины и хибарки Осторожно пересек клетки классиков в одной  позабытый камушекНе сгорел Возле склада мальчик на

исчезнувший запах и положил в кармашек у сердца Язык цветов Им это нравится потому что нельзя подслушать Или отравленный букет разделаться с ним Шагая медленно дальше он перечел еще раз письмо шепча отдельные слова про себя Сердились тюльпаны на тебя миленький мужецвет проучить твой кактус если ты пожалуйста бедняжка незабудка я так мечтаю фиалки мой милый розы когда же мы анемоны встретимся противный ночной пестик жена духи Марте Он перечел до конца вынул его из газеты и спрятал обратно в боковой карманТихая радость приоткрыла его губы Не сравнить с первым письмомИнтересно сама писала Разыгрывает возмущение я девушка из хорошей семьи пример добродетели Могли бы встретиться в воскресенье после мессыБольшое спасибо  не по моей части Обычная любовная драчка Потом разбегутся по углам Не лучше чем сцены с Молли Сигара успокаиваетНаркотик В следующий раз пойти еще дальше Противный мальчишка проучить боится слов конечно Чтонибудь шокирующее а Стоит попробовать Каждый раз понемножкуПродолжая ощупывать письмо в кармане он вытащил из него булавкуПростая булавка Он бросил ее на землю Откуданибудь из одежды чтото закалывала Это немыслимо сколько на них булавок Нет розы без шиповГрубые дублинские голоса взвыли у него в голове В ту ночь в Куме две девки обнявшись под дождемЭх у Мэри панталоны на одной булавкеА булавка упадет Как домой она дойдетКак домой она дойдетКто Мэри Ужасно болит голова Наверно их месячные розы Или целый день за машинкой Вредно для нервов желудка Зрительное напряжение Какими духами душится твоя жена Додумалась аКак домой она дойдетМарта Мэри Мария и Марфа Гдето я видел эту картину забыл уже старого мастера или подделка Он сидит у них в доме разговариваетТаинственно Те девки из Кума тоже слушали быКак домой она дойдетПриятное вечернее чувство Скитанья кончены Можешь расслабиться  мирные сумерки  пусть все идет своим чередом Забудь Рассказывай о тех местах где ты был о чужих обычаях Другая с кувшином на голове готовила ужин фрукты маслины прохладная вода из колодца хладнокаменного как дырка в стене в Эштауне В следующий раз как пойду на бега надо будет прихватить бумажный стаканчик Она слушает с расширенными глазами темные ласковые глаза Рассказывай  еще и еще  все расскажи И потом вздох молчание Долгий  долгий  долгий покойПроходя под железнодорожным мостом он вынул конверт проворно изорвал на клочки и пустил по ветру Клочки разлетелись быстро падая вниз в сыром воздухе белая стайка потом все попадалиГенри Флауэр Вот так можно разорвать и чек на сто фунтов Простой листик бумаги Лорд Айви явился както в Ирландский банк с семизначным чеком получил миллион наличными Вот и смотри что можно взять на портере Зато другой братец лорд Ардилон говорят должен менять рубашку четыре раза на день Какието вши не то черви Миллион фунтов минуткуДва пенса  это пинта четыре  кварта значит галлон портера восемь пенсов хотя нет шиллинг четыре пенса Двадцать поделить на один и четыре примерно пятнадцать Так точно Пятнадцать миллионов бочонков портераЧто я говорю бочонков Галлонов Но все равно около миллиона бочонковПрибывающий поезд тяжело пролязгал над головой у него один вагон за другим В голове стукались бочонки плескался и переливался мутный портерЗатычки вылетели полился мощный мутный поток растекаясь по грязной земле петляя образуя озерки и водовороты хмельной влаги и увлекая с собой широколистые цветы ее пеныОн подошел к отворенным задним дверям церкви Всех Святых Ступив на крыльцо снял шляпу вытащил из кармана визитную карточку и снова засунул ее за кожаный ободок Тьфу ты Ведь мог прощупать Маккоя насчет бесплатного проезда в МоллингарПрежнее объявление на дверях Проповедь высокопреподобного Джона Конми ОИ о святом Петре Клавере ОИ и об африканской миссии Спасать миллионы китайцев Как они ухитряются это растолковать косоглазым Те предпочли бы унцию опиума Жители Небесной Империи Для них первейшая ересь За обращение Гладстона молились когда был уже почти в беспамятстве Протестанты такие же Обратить в истинную веру Вильяма ДжУолша доктора Богословия Ихний бог  Будда что на боку в музее лежит Подложил руку под голову прохлаждается Возжигают куренияНепохоже на   Терновый венец и крестТрилистник  хорошая придумка святого Патрика А едят палочками КонмиМартин Каннингем с ним знаком почтенного вида Надо было к нему пойти когда устраивал Молли в хор а не к этому отцу Фарли что на вид простачок а на самом деле Так учат их Уж этот не отправится крестить негритят пот ручьями солнечные очки А те дивились бы на очки как сверкают Забавно бы поглядеть как они там сидят в кружок развесив толстые губищи и в полном восторге слушают Натюрморт Лакают как молочкоПрохладный запах святых камней влек его Он поднялся по истертым ступеням толкнул дверь и тихонько вошелЧто то тут делается служба какойто общины Жаль что так пустоОтличное укромное местечко где бы пристроиться рядом с приятной девушкойКто мой ближний Часами в тесноте под тягучую музыку Та женщина у вечерней мессы На седьмом небе Женщины стали на колени у своих скамей опустив головы вокруг шей алые ленточки Часть стала на колени у алтарной решетки Священник обходил их шепотом бормоча держа в руках эту штукуВозле каждой он останавливался вынимал причастие стряхивал однудве капли они что в воде и аккуратненько клал ей в рот Ее шляпа и голова дернулись вниз К следующей маленькая старушка Священник наклонился чтобы положить его ей в рот все время продолжая шептать Латынь К следующей Закрой глаза открой рот Что  ТелоТруп Хорошая находка латынь Первым делом их одурманить Приют для умирающих Кажется они это не жуют сразу глотают Дикая идея  есть куски трупа Тото каннибалы клюют на этоОн стоял чуть поодаль глядя как их незрячие маски движутся вереницей по проходу ищут свои места Потом подошел к скамье и сел с краю продолжая держать свои газету и шляпу И что за горшки мы носим Шляпы надо бы делать по форме головы Они были рассеяны вокруг там и сям головы все еще опущены алые ленточки ждут пока это растопится в их желудках Вроде мацы тот же сорт хлеба пресные хлебы предложения Только посмотреть на них Так и видно как счастливы Конфетка Счастливы до предела Да это называется хлеб ангелов За этим большая идея чувствуешь чтото в том роде что Царство Божие внутри нас Первые причастники Чудо для крошек леденец за грошик После этого они все чувствуют себя как одна семья то же самое в театре все заодно Конечно чувствуют я уверен Не так одиноко мы все собратья Потом в приподнятых чувствах Дает разрядкуВо что веришь понастоящему это и существует Исцеления в Лурде воды забвения явление в Ноке кровоточащие статуи Старикан заснул возле исповедальни Оттуда и храп Слепая вера Обеспечил местечко в грядущем царствии Убаюкивает все страдания Разбудите в это же время через годОн увидел как священник убрал чашу с причастием кудато внутрь и на мгновение стал на колени перед ней выставив серую большую подметку изпод кружевного балахона что был на нем А вдруг и у него на одной булавкеКак он домой дойдет Сзади круглая плешь На спине буквы ИНЦИ Нет ИХС Молли мне както объяснила Ищу храм святости  или нет ищу храм страдания вот как А те другие И нас целиком искупилВстретиться в воскресенье после мессы Исполни эту мою просьбуПоявится под вуалью и с черной сумочкой В сумерках и против света Могла бы быть тут с ленточкой на шее и все равно тайком проделывать такие делишки Они способны Тот гусь что выдал непобедимых он каждое утро ходил Кэри его звали к причастию Вот в эту самую церковь Питер КэриНет это у меня Петр Клавер в голове Дэнис Кэри Представить только себеДома жена и шестеро детей И все время готовил это убийство Эти святоши вот самое подходящее для них слово в них всегда чтото скользкое И в делах тоже они виляют Да нет ее нет здесь  цветок  нет нет А кстати конвертто я разорвал Дада под мостомСвященник ополоснул потир потом залпом ловко опрокинул остатки ВиноТак аристократичней чем если бы он пил что уж они там пьют портер Гиннесса или чтонибудь безалкогольное дублинское горькое Уитли или имбирный эль ароматизированный Кантрелла и Кокрейна Им не дает вино предложения только то другое Скупятся Святые мошенники но правильно делают иначе бы все пьянчужки сбегались клянчить Странная атмосфера в этих Правильно делают Совершенно правыМистер Блум оглянулся на хоры Музыки никакой не будет Жаль Кто у них органист Старый Глинн вот тот умел заставить инструмент говорить вибрато  по слухам пятьдесят фунтов в год ему платили на Гардинерстрит В тот день Молли была очень в голосе   Россини Сначала проповедь отца Бернарда ВохенаХристос или Пилат Да Христос только не томи нас всю ночь Вот музыку они хотели Шарканье прекратилось Булавка упадет  слышно Я ей посоветовал направлять голос в тот угол Волнение так и чувствовалось в воздухе на пределе все даже головы подняли  В этой старой церковной музыке есть чудесные вещи Меркаданте семь последних слов Двенадцатая месса Моцарта а из нее   Папы в старину знали толк и в музыке и в искусстве во всяческих статуях картинах Или Палестрина к примеру Пока так было в добрые старые времена славная была жизнь И для здоровья полезно пение правильный режим потом варили ликеры Бенедиктин Зеленый шартрез Но всетаки держать в хоре кастратов это уж чтото слишком А какие это голоса Наверно интересно было слушать после их собственных густых басовЗнатоки Должно быть они после этого ничего не чувствуют Некая безмятежность Не о чем беспокоиться Жиреют что им еще Высокие длинноногие обжоры Кто знает Кастрат Тоже выход из положенияОн увидел как священник нагнулся и поцеловал алтарь потом повернувшись к собравшимся благословил их Все перекрестились и всталиМистер Блум оглянулся по сторонам и тоже встал глядя поверх поднявшихся шляп Встают  это конечно для евангелия Потом все опять стали на колени а он спокойно уселся на скамью Священник сошел с алтарного возвышения держа перед собой предмет и они с прислужником стали друг другу отвечать полатыни Потом священник стал на колени и начал читать по бумажке Господь наше прибежище и сила нашаМистер Блум подался вперед чтобы уловить слова Английский Бросить им кость Еще чтото помню Когда был у мессы последний раз Преславная и непорочная дева Супруг ее Иосиф Петр и Павел Так интересней когда понимаешь о чем все это Блестящая организация это факт работает как часы Исповедь Все стремятся Тогда я скажу тебе все Раскаяние Прошу вас накажите меня Сильнейшее оружие в их руках Сильней чем у доктора или адвоката Женщины просто с ума сходят А я шушушушушушу А вы бубубубубубу Зачем же это вы Разглядывает свое кольцо ищет оправданиеШепчущая галерея у стен есть уши Муж к своему изумлению узнаетГосподь слегка подшутил Потом она выходит Раскаяние на пять минут Мило пристыжена Молитва у алтаря Аве Мария да святая Мария Цветы ладан оплывающие свечи Прячет румянец Армия спасения  жалкая подделка Перед нашим собранием выступит раскаявшаяся блудница Как я обрела Господа В Риме должно быть головастые парни это они ведь заправляют всей лавочкой И денежки хорошие загребают Завещания приходскому священнику в его полное распоряжение Служить мессы за упокой моей души всенародно при открытых дверях Монастыри мужские и женские В деле о завещании Ферманы священник в числе свидетелей Этого не собьешь Ответ заранее на все готов Свобода и возвышение нашей святой матери церкви Учители церкви они на это придумали целое богословиеСвященник молился Блаженный архангеле Михаиле огради нас в час бедствий Сохрани нас от злобы и козней диавола смиренно молим да укротит его Господь и властию Божией о княже воинства небесного низрини его сатану во ад и с ним купно прочих злых бесов кои рыщут по свету погибели ради душ нашихСвященник с прислужником встали и пошли прочь Кончено Женщины еще остались благодарениеПора убираться Брат Обирало Вдруг пойдет с блюдом Вноси свою лептуОн поднялся Эге Это что же две пуговицы на жилете так и были расстегнуты Женщины в таких случаях в восторге Никогда не скажут тебеЛюбят когда у тебя слегка растрепанный вид А уж мыто Простите мисс тут у вас гмм крохотная гмм пушинка Или крючок расстегнется сзади на юбке Проблеск луны Досадуют если ты не Что же ты раньше не сказалХорошо еще тут а не дальше к югу Он прошел меж скамей незаметно застегиваясь на ходу и главною дверью вышел на свет Зажмурясь он остановился на миг возле холодной черной мраморной чаши покуда сзади и спереди от него две богомолки окунали робкие руки в мелководье святой воды Трамваи  фургон из красильни Прескотта  вдовица в трауре Замечаю потому что сам в трауре Он

склянка у вас найдется с собой Нет  сказал мистер Блум  Вы приготовьте пожалуйста а я зайду попоздней сегодня И я возьму еще мыло какоенибудь из этих Они почем Четыре пенса сэрМистер Блум поднес кусок к носу Сладковатолимонный воск Вот это я возьму  решил он  Итого будет три и пенни Да сэр  сказал аптекарь  Вы можете заплатить за все сразу когда придете Хорошо  сказал мистер БлумОн вышел из аптеки не торопясь держа под мышкой трубку газеты и в левой руке мыло в прохладной оберткеУ самой подмышки голос и рука Бэнтама Лайонса сказали Приветствую Блум что новенького Это сегодняшняя Вы не покажете на минуткуФу ты опять усы сбрил Длинная холодная верхняя губа Чтобы выглядеть помоложе А выглядит подурацки Он моложе меняПальцы Бэнтама Лайонса желтые с чернотой под ногтями развернули газету Ему бы тоже помыться Содрать корку грязи Доброе утро вы не забыли воспользоваться мылом Пирса По плечам перхоть Череп бы смазывал Хочу взглянуть насчет французской лошадки что сегодня бежит  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс  Черт да где тут онаОн шелестел мятыми страницами ерзая подбородком тудасюда по тугому воротничку Зуд после бритья От такого воротничка волосы будут лезтьОставить ему газету чтоб отвязался Можете взять себе  сказал мистер Блум Аскот Золотой кубок Постойте  бормотал Бэнтам Лайонс  Один моМаксим Второй Я здесь только рекламу смотрел  добавил мистер БлумВнезапно Бэнтам Лайонс поднял на него глаза в которых мелькнуло хитрое выражение Каккак вы сказали  переспросил он отрывисто Я говорю можете взять себе  повторил мистер Блум  Я все равно хотел выбросить только посмотрел рекламуБэнтам Лайонс с тем же выражением в глазах поколебался минуту  потом сунул раскрытые листы обратно мистеру Блуму Ладно рискну  проговорил он  Держите спасибоЕдва не бегом он двинулся в сторону Конвея Прыть как у зайцаМистер Блум усмехнувшись снова сложил листы аккуратным прямоугольником и поместил между ними мыло Дурацкие стали губы Играет на скачках Последнее время просто повальная зараза

гонки  гонки а по ободу университетские Вот это бы бросалось в глазаВон и Хорнблоуэр у ворот С ним стоит поддерживать мог бы туда пропускать за так Как поживаете мистер Хорнблоуэр Как поживаете

потоке жизни наш взгляд что нам дороооже всегоА теперь насладимся баней чистая ванна с водой прохладная эмаль теплый ласкающий поток Сие есть тело моеОн видел заранее свое бледное тело целиком погруженное туда нагое в лоне тепла умащенное душистым тающим мылом мягко омываемое Он видел свое туловище и члены покрытые струйной рябью невесомо зависшие слегка увлекаемые вверх лимонножелтые свой пуп завязь плоти и видел как струятся темные спутанные пряди поросли и струятся пряди потока вокруг поникшего отца тысяч вяло колышущегося цветкаЭпизод Мартин Каннингем первый просунул оцилиндренную голову внутрь скрипучей кареты и ловко войдя уселся За ним шагнул мистер Пауэр пригибаясь изза своего роста Садитесь Саймон После вас  сказал мистер БлумМистер Дедал надел живо шляпу и поднялся в карету проговорив Дада Все уже здесь  спросил Мартин Каннингем  Забирайтесь БлумМистер Блум вошел и сел на свободное место Потом взялся за дверцу и плотно притянул ее пока она не закрылась плотно Продел руку в петлю и с серьезным видом посмотрел через открытое окошко кареты на спущенные шторы соседских окон Одна отдернута старуха глазеет Приплюснула нос к стеклу побелел Благодарит небо что не ее черед Поразительно какой у них интерес к трупам Рады нас проводить на тот свет так тяжко родить на этотЗанятие в самый раз по ним Шушуканье по углам Шмыгают неслышно в шлепанцах боятся еще проснется Потом прибрать его Положить на столМолли и миссис Флеминг стелют ложе Подтяните слегка к себе Наш саван Не узнаешь кто тебя мертвого будет трогать Обмыть тело голову Ногти и волосы кажется подрезают Часть на память в конвертик Потом все равно отрастают Нечистое занятиеВсе ждали не говоря ни слова Наверно венки выносят На чтото твердое сел А это мыло в заднем кармане Лучше убрать оттуда Подожди случаяВсе ждали Потом спереди донеслись звуки колес  ближе  потом стук копыт Тряхнуло Карета тронулась скрипя и покачиваясь Послышались другие копыта и скрипучие колеса сзади Проплыли соседские окна и номер девятый с открытой дверью с крепом на дверном молотке ШагомОни еще выжидали с подпрыгивающими коленями покуда не повернули и не поехали вдоль трамвайной линии Трайтонвиллроуд Быстрей Колеса застучали по булыжной мостовой и расшатанные стекла запрыгали стуча в рамах По какой это он дороге  спросил мистер Пауэр в оба окошка Айриштаун  ответил Мартин Каннингем  Рингсенд БрансвикстритМистер Дедал поглядев наружу кивнул Хороший старый обычай  сказал он  Отрадно что еще не забытС минуту все смотрели в окна на фуражки и шляпы приподнимаемые прохожими Дань уважения Карета миновав Уотерилейн свернула с рельсов на более гладкую дорогу Взгляд мистера Блума заметил стройного юношу в трауре и широкополой шляпе Тут мимо один ваш друг Дедал  сказал он Кто это Ваш сын и наследник Где он там  спросил мистер Дедал перегибаясь к окну напротивКарета миновав улицу с доходными домами и развороченной в канавах и ямах мостовой свернула накренившись за угол и снова покатила вдоль рельсов громко стуча колесами Мистер Дедал откинулся назад и спросил А этот прохвост Маллиган тоже с ним Его   Да нет он один  ответил мистер Блум От тетушки Салли надо думать  сказал мистер Дедал  Эта шайка Гулдингов пьяненький счетоводишка и Крисси папочкина вошкасикушка то мудрое дитя что узнает отцаМистер Блум бесстрастно усмехнулся глядя на Рингсендроуд Братья Уоллес производство

Игнатием Галлахером на Стеймерстрит напялив две хозяйкины шляпы на голову Ночи напролет куролесил Теперь начинает расплачиваться боюсь что эта его боль в пояснице Жена утюжит спину Думает вылечиться пилюльками А в них один хлеб Процентов шестьсот чистой прибыли Связался со всяким сбродом  продолжал сварливо мистер Дедал  Этот Маллиган вам любой скажет это отпетый бандит насквозь испорченный тип От одного его имени воняет по всему Дублину Но с помощью Божией и Пресвятой Девы я им особо займусь я напишу его матери или тетке или кто она там ему такое письмо что у нее глаза полезут на лоб Я тыл ему коленом почешу могу вас заверитьОн силился перекричать громыханье колес Я не позволю чтобы этот ублюдок ее племянничек губил бы моего сына Отродье зазывалы из лавки Шнурки продает у моего родича Питера Пола Максвайни Не выйдетОн смолк Мистер Блум перевел взгляд с его сердитых усов на кроткое лицо мистера Пауэра потом на глаза и бороду Мартина Каннингема которые солидно покачивались Шумливый человек своевольный Носится со своим сыном И правильно Чтото после себя оставить Если бы Руди малютка остался жить Видеть как он растет Слышать голосок в доме Как идет рядом с Молли в итонской курточке Мой сын Я в его глазах Странное было бы ощущение От меня Слепой случай Это видно тем утром на Реймондтеррас она из окна глядела как две собаки случаются под стеной не содейте зла И сержант ухмылялся Она была в том палевом халате с прорехой так и не собралась зашить Польди давай мы Ох я так хочу умираю Так начинается жизньПотом в положении Пришлось отменить концерт в Грейстоуне Мой сын в ней Я мог бы его поставить на ноги Мог бы Сделать самостоятельным Немецкому научить Мы не опаздываем  спросил мистер Пауэр На десять минут  сказал Мартин Каннингем посмотрев на часыМолли Милли То же самое но пожиже Ругается как мальчишка Катись колбаской Чертики с рожками Нет она милая девчушка Станет уж скоро женщиной Моллингар Дражайший папулька Студент Да да тоже женщина Жизнь ЖизньКарету качнуло взадвперед и с ней четыре их ту лова Корни мог бы нам дать какуюнибудь колымагу поудобней  заметил мистер Пауэр Мог бы  сказал мистер Дедал  если бы он так не косил Вы меня понимаетеОн прищурил левый глаз Мартин Каннингем начал смахивать хлебные крошки со своего сиденья Что это еще Боже милостивый  проговорил он  Крошки Похоже что ктото тут устраивал недавно пикник  сказал мистер ПауэрВсе привстали недовольно оглядывая прелую с оборванными пуговицами кожу сидений Мистер Дедал покрутил носом глядя вниз поморщился и сказал Или я сильно ошибаюсь Как вам кажется Мартин Я и сам поразился  сказал Мартин КаннингемМистер Блум опустился на сиденье Удачно что зашел в баню Ноги чувствуешь совершенно чистыми Вот только бы еще миссис Флеминг заштопала эти носки получшеМистер Дедал отрешенно вздохнув сказал В конце концов это самая естественная вещь на свете А Том Кернан появился  спросил Мартин Каннингем слегка теребя кончик бороды Да  ответил мистер Блум  Он едет за нами с Хайнсом и с Недом Лэмбертом А сам Корни Келлехер  спросил мистер Пауэр На кладбище  сказал Мартин Каннингем Я встретил утром Маккоя  сообщил мистер Блум  и он сказал тоже постарается приехатьКарета резко остановилась Что там такое Застряли Где мыМистер Блум высунул голову из окна Большой канал  сказал онГазовый завод Говорят вылечивает коклюш Повезло что у Милли этого не было Бедные дети Сгибаются пополам в конвульсиях синеют чернеютПросто кошмар С болезнями сравнительно легко обошлось Одна корь Чай из льняного семени Скарлатина эпидемии инфлюэнцы Рекламные агенты смертиНе упустите такого случая Вон там собачий приют Старый Атос беднягаБудь добрым к Атосу Леопольд это мое последнее желание Да будет воля твоя Слушаемся их когда они в могиле Предсмертные каракули Он себе места не находил тосковал Смирный пес У стариков обычно такиеКапля дождя упала ему на шляпу Он спрятал голову и увидел как серые плиты моментально усеялись темными точками По отдельности Интересно Как через сито Я так и думал пойдет Помнится подошвы скрипели Погода меняется  спокойно сообщил он Жаль быстро испортилась  откликнулся Мартин Каннингем Для полей нужно  сказал мистер Пауэр  А вон и солнце

все это испытали  заметил неопределенно Мартин КаннингемГлаза его встретились с глазами мистера Блума Погладив свою бороду он добавил Ну скажем почти все из насМистер Блум заговорил с внезапною живостью вглядываясь в лица спутников Это просто отличная история что ходит насчет Рувима Дж и его сына Про лодочника  спросил мистер Пауэр Дада Отличная ведь история А что там  спросил мистер Дедал  Я не слышал Там возникла какаято девица  начал мистер Блум  и он решил услать его от греха подальше на остров Мэн но когда они оба Чточто  переспросил мистер Дедал  Это этот окаянный уродец Ну да  сказал мистер Блум  Они оба уже шли на пароход и тот вдруг в воду Варавва в воду  воскликнул мистер Дедал  Экая жалость не утонулМистер Пауэр снова зашелся смехом выпуская воздух через заслоненные ноздри Да нет  принялся объяснять мистер Блум  это сынМартин Каннингем бесцеремонно вмешался в его речь Рувим Дж с сыном шли по набережной реки к пароходу на остров Мэн и тут вдруг юный балбес

серьезный вид  сказал Мартин КаннингемМистер Дедал вздохнул Бедняга Падди не стал бы ворчать на нас что мы посмеялись В свое время сам порассказывал хороших историй Да простит мне Бог  проговорил мистер Пауэр вытирая влажные глаза пальцами  Бедный Падди Не думал я неделю назад когда его встретил последний раз и был он как всегда здоровехонек что буду ехать за ним вот так Ушел от нас Из всех кто только носил шляпу на голове самый достойный крепышок  выразился мистер Дедал  Ушел в одночасье Удар  молвил Мартин Каннингем  СердцеПечально он похлопал себя по грудиЛицо как распаренное багровое Злоупотреблял горячительным Средство от красноты носа Пей до чертиков покуда не станет трупносерым Порядком он денег потратил чтоб перекраситьМистер Пауэр смотрел на проплывающие дома со скорбным

сказал мистер Пауэр  это когда человек кончает с собойМартин Каннингем быстрым движением вынул часы кашлянул спрятал часы обратно И это такое бесчестье если у когото в семье  продолжал мистер Пауэр Временное умопомрачение разумеется  решительно произнес Мартин Каннингем  Надо к этому относиться с милосердием Говорят тот кто так поступает трус  сказал мистер Дедал Не нам судить  возразил Мартин КаннингемМистер Блум собравшись было заговорить снова сомкнул уста Большие глаза Мартина Каннингема Сейчас отвернулся Гуманный сострадательный человек И умный На Шекспира похож Всегда найдет доброе слово А у них никакой жалости насчет этого и насчет детоубийства тоже Лишают христианского погребения Раньше загоняли в могилу кол в сердце ему Как будто и так уже не разбито Но иногда те раскаиваются

большие гонки Кубок Гордона Беннета Да убей бог  хмыкнул мистер Дедал  Это бы стоило посмотретьКогда они свернули на Берклистрит уличная шарманка возле Бассейна встретила и проводила их разухабистым

родильный приют Из одной крайности в другуюКарета завернула галопом за угол  и стала Что там ещеСтадо клейменого скота разделившись обтекало карету тяжело ступая разбитыми копытами мыча лениво обмахивая хвостами загаженные костлявые крупы По бокам и в гуще гурта трусили меченые овцы блея от страха Эмигранты  сказал мистер Пауэр Гей Гей  покрикивал голос скотогона бич его щелкал по их бокам

было мясо с душком покупать прямо с поезда в КлонзиллеКарета пробиралась сквозь стадо Не могу понять почему муниципалитет не проложит линию трамвая от ворот парка к набережным  сказал мистер Блум  Можно было бы весь этот скот доставлять вагонами прямо на пароходы Чем загораживать движение  поддержал Мартин Каннингем  Очень правильно Так и надо бы сделать Да  продолжал мистер Блум  и еще другое я часто думаю это чтобы устроили похоронные трамваи знаете как в Милане Провести линию до кладбища и пустить специальные трамваи катафалк траурный кортеж все как положено Вы понимаете мою идею Ну это уж анекдот какойто  молвил мистер Дедал  Вагон спальный и вагонресторан Печальные перспективы для Корни  добавил мистер Пауэр Почему же  возразил мистер Блум оборачиваясь к мистеру Дедалу  Разве не будет это приличней чем трястись вот так парами нос к носу Ну ладно может тут и есть чтото  снизошел мистер Дедал И к тому же  сказал Мартин Каннингем  мы бы избавились от сцен вроде той когда катафалк перевернулся у Данфи и опрокинул гроб на дорогу Совершенно ужасный случай  сказало потрясенное лицо мистера Пауэра И труп вывалился на мостовую Ужасно Первым на повороте у Данфи  одобрительно кивнул мистер Дедал  На кубок Гордона Беннета Господи помилуй  произнес набожно Мартин КаннингемТрах На попа Гроб грохается об мостовую Крышка долой Падди Дигнам вылетает и катится в пыли как колода в коричневом костюме который ему велик Красное лицо  сейчас серое Рот разинут Спрашивает чего такое творится Правильно закрывают им Жуткое зрелище с открытым И внутренности быстрей разлагаются Самое лучшее закрыть все отверстия Ага и там Воском Сфинктер расслабляется Все заткнуть Данфи  объявил мистер Пауэр когда карета повернула направоПерекресток Данфи Стоят траурные кареты залить горе Придорожный привал Для трактира идеальное место Наверняка заглянем на обратном пути пропустить за его здоровье Чаша утешения Эликсир жизниА допустим правда случилось бы Пошла бы у него кровь скажем

Как так  спросил Мартин Каннингем  Я думал он ему сделал ручкой Хоть скрылся из глаз но для памяти дорог  промолвил мистер ДедалКарета повернула налево по ФингласроудНаправо камнерезные мастерские

зияющей пастью После жизненного странствияПотянулись угрюмые сады один за другим  угрюмые домаМистер Пауэр показал рукой Вон там был убит Чайлдс  сказал он  В крайнем доме Там  подтвердил мистер Дедал  Жуткая история Братоубийство Так считали по крайней мере А Сеймур Буш его вытянул Улик не было  сказал мистер Пауэр Одни косвенные  сказал Мартин Каннингем  Таков принцип правосудия Пусть лучше

распахнул дверцу толкнув коленом Он вышел За ним мистер Пауэр и мистер ДедалМомент переложить мыло Рука мистера Блума проворно расстегнула задний брючный карман и отправила мыло слипшееся с оберткой во внутренний карман с носовым платком Он вышел сунув обратно газету которую все еще держала другая рукаУбогие похороны три кареты и катафалк Какая разница Факельщики золоченая сбруя заупокойная месса артиллерийский салют Смерть с помпойУ последней кареты стоял разносчик с лотком фруктов и пирожков Черствые пирожки ссохлись вместе пирожки для покойников Собачья радость Кто их ест Те кто обратно с кладбищаОн шел за своими спутниками позади мистер Кернан и Нед Лэмберт за ними Хайнс Корни Келлехер стоявший у открытого катафалка взял два венка и передал один мальчикуА куда же делись те детские похороныУпряжка лошадей со стороны Фингласроуд натужно тащила в похоронном молчании скрипучую телегу с глыбой гранита Шагавший впереди возчик снял шапкуТеперь гроб Хоть мертвый а поспел раньше Лошадь

гроб и понесли в ворота Мертвый вес больше Я сам себя чувствовал тяжелей когда вылезал из ванны Сначала труп потом друзья трупа За гробом с венками шли Корни Келлехер и мальчик А кто это рядом с ними Ах да своякВсе двигались следомМартин Каннингем зашептал Я так и обомлел когда вы при Блуме начали о самоубийствах Чточто  зашептал мистер Пауэр  А почему Его отец отравился  шептал Мартин Каннингем  Он был хозяин отеля Куинз в Эннисе Слышали он сказал он едет в Клэр Годовщина О Господи  шептал мистер Пауэр  В первый раз слышу ОтравилсяОн оглянулся туда где в сторону усыпальницы кардинала двигалось лицо с темными задумчивыми глазами Беседуя А он был застрахован  спросил мистер Блум Кажется да  отвечал мистер Кернан  но только он заложил свой полис Мартин хлопочет чтобы младшего устроить в Артейн А сколько всего детишек Пятеро Нед Лэмберт обещает устроить одну из девочек к Тодду Печальный случай  с сочувствием произнес мистер Блум  Пятеро маленьких детей А какой удар для жены  добавил мистер Кернан Еще бы  согласился мистер БлумЧихала она теперь на негоОн опустил взгляд на свои начищенные ботинки Она пережила егоОвдовела Для нее он мертвее чем для меня Всегда один должен пережить другого Мудрецы говорят Женщин на свете больше мужчин меньше Выразить ей соболезнование Ваша ужасная утрата Надеюсь вы вскоре последуете за ним Это только вдовы индусов Она может выйти за другого За него НетХотя кто знает Вдовство больше не в чести как старая королева умерлаВезли на лафете Виктория и Альберт Траурная церемония во Фрогморе Но в конце она себе позволила парочку фиалок на шляпку Тщеславие в сердце сердца Все ради тени Консорт даже не король Ее сын вот где было чтото реальное Какаято новая надежда а не то прошлое которое она все ждала вернется Оно не может вернуться Комуто уйти первым  в одиночку под землю  и не лежать уж в ее теплой постели Как поживаете Саймон  тихо спросил Нед Лэмберт пожимая руку  Не виделись с вами целую вечность Лучше не бывает А что новенького в нашем преславном Корке Я ездил туда на скачки на светлой неделе  сказал Нед Лэмберт  Нового одно старое Остановился у Дика Тайви И как там наш Дик честняга Как есть ничего между ним и небом  выразился Нед Лэмберт Силы небесные  ахнул мистер Дедал в тихом изумлении  Дик Тайви облысел Мартин Каннингем пустил подписной лист в пользу ребятни  сказал Нед Лэмберт кивнув вперед  По нескольку шиллингов с души Чтобы им продержаться пока получат страховку Дада  произнес неопределенно мистер Дедал  Это что старший там впереди Да  сказал Нед Лэмберт  и брат жены За ними Джон Генри Ментон Он уже подписался на фунт Я был всегда в нем уверен  заявил мистер Дедал  Сколько раз я говорил Падди чтоб он держался за ту работу Джон Генри  это не худшее что бывает А как он потерял это место  спросил Нед Лэмберт  Попивал чересчур Грешок многих добрых людей  со вздохом молвил мистер ДедалОни остановились у входа в часовню Мистер Блум стоял позади мальчика с венком глядя вниз на его прилизанные волосы и тонкую с ложбинкой шею в новеньком тесном воротничке Бедный мальчуган Был ли он при этом когда отец Оба без сознания В последний миг приходит в себя и узнает всех в последний раз Все что он мог бы сделать Я должен три шиллинга ОГрэдиПонимал ли он Служители внесли гроб в часовню Где голова у негоЧерез мгновение он прошел за другими моргая после яркого света Гроб стоял перед алтарем на подставке по углам четыре высокие желтые свечиВсегда впереди нас Корни Келлехер прислонив венки у передних углов знаком указал мальчику стать на колени Вошедшие стали там и сям на колени у мест для молящихся Мистер Блум стоял позади невдалеке от купели и когда все стали на колени аккуратно уронил из кармана развернутую газету и стал на нее правым коленом На левое колено он осторожно поместил свою шляпу и придерживая ее за поля благочестиво склонил головуИз дверей появился служка неся медное ведерко с чемто внутри За ним шел священник в белом одной рукой поправляя столу другой придерживая маленькую книжицу у своего жабьего брюха А кто будет нам читать Каркнул ворон я опятьОни стали у гроба и священник принялся быстро каркать по своей книжкеОтец Гробби Я помню както похоже на гроб  Здоровенная морда Заправляет спектаклем Дюжий христианин Горе тому кто на него косо глянет священник Ты еси ПетрОтъел бока как баран на клевере сказал бы Дедал И брюхо раздулось как у дохлого пса Где он такие выражения находит диву даешься Пуфф бока лопаются        Дает им чувство собственной важности когда над ними молятся полатыниЗаупокойная месса Все в трауре рыдают Бумага с траурной каймой Твое имя в поминальном листе Как зябко тут Его и тянет поесть когда сидит уныло все утро притопывает ногами да ждет следующего милости просим И глаза жабьи С чего его так пучит Молли эту с капусты Может быть тут воздух такой На вид как будто раздут от газов В таком месте должна быть адская пропасть газов Мясников взять сами становятся как сырые бифштексы Кто мне рассказывал Мервин Браун В крипте святой Верберги у них чудный орган старинный полтораста лет им там пришлось пробуравить дырки в гробах чтобы газы выпустить и поджечь Со свистом вырывается синий Свистнуло  и тебя нетКолено больно Ох Вот так лучшеСвященник взял из служкиного ведерка палку с шишкой на конце и помахал ей над гробом Потом пошел в ноги гроба помахал там Вернулся на место и положил ее обратно в ведерко Каким и был покуда не упокоился Это все записано он это все обязан проделать      Служка вторил ему писклявым дискантом Я часто думал что лучше брать прислугу из мальчиков Лет до пятнадцати Старше уже конечноА там святая вода должно быть Окропляет сном Небось уже обрыдло ему махать махалкой над всеми трупами что подвозят Пускай бы полюбовался над чем он машет Каждый божий день свежая порция мужчины средних лет старухи дети женщины умершие родами бородачи лысые бизнесмены чахоточные девицы с цыплячьими грудками Круглый год бормочет над ними одно и то же потом покропит водой спите Сейчас вот Дигнама  Говорит он пойдет в рай или уже в раю Над каждым повторяет Нудное дело Но чтото он должен говоритьСвященник закрыл книжку и вышел служка за ним Корни Келлехер открыл боковые двери и вошли могильщики Они снова подняли гроб вынесли его и опустили на свою каталку Корни Келлехер дал один венок мальчику другой свояку и все следом за ними вышли через боковые двери на воздух теплый и пасмурный Мистер Блум вышел последним сунув обратно в карман сложенную газету Взор его оставался чинно потуплен пока каталка с гробом не повернула налево Железные колеса визгливо скрежетнули по гравию и отряд тупоносых башмаков двинулся за каталкой по аллее могилТари тара тари тара тару Батюшки тут разве можно петь Мавзолей ОКоннелла  сказал Дедал рядом с нимКроткие глаза мистера Пауэра поднялись к вершине высокого обелиска Тут он покоится  произнес он  среди своего народа старый Дэн ОНо сердце его погребено в Риме А сколько разбитых сердец погребено тут Саймон Там вон ее могила Джек  сказал мистер Дедал  Скоро и я лягу рядом Да призовет Он меня когда будет воля ЕгоНе удержавшись он начал тихо всхлипывать бредя неровной оступающейся походкой Мистер Пауэр взял его под руку Ей лучше там где она сейчас  мягко промолвил он Да я знаю  ответил сдавленно мистер Дедал  Она сейчас на небе если только есть небоКорни Келлехер шагнул в сторону и пропустил остальных вперед Печальные события  учтиво заговорил мистер КернанМистер Блум прикрыл глаза и дважды скорбно покивал головой Все остальные надели шляпы  заметил мистер Кернан  Я думаю и нам тоже стоит Мы последние Это кладбище коварное местоОни покрыли головы А вам не кажется что его преподобие отслужил слишком скоропалительно  сказал с неодобрением мистер КернанМистер Блум солидно кивнул глянув в живые глаза с красными прожилкамиСкрытные глаза скрытные и обыскивающие Видимо масон точно не знаюОпять рядом с ним Мы последние В равном положении Авось он чтонибудь еще скажетМистер Кернан добавил Служба Ирландской Церкви на Иеронимовой Горе и проще и более впечатляет я должен это сказатьМистер Блум выразил сдержанное согласие Язык конечно многое значитМистер Кернан торжественно произнес Я есмь воскресение и жизнь  Это проникает до самой глубины сердца Действительно  сказал мистер БлумТвоего то может и да но какой прок малому в ящике шесть футов на два с цветочком из пятки Ему проникает Седалище страстей Разбитое сердце В конечном счете насос качает каждый день сотни галлонов крови Потом в один прекрасный день закупорка и ты с концами Их тут вокруг навалом кишки печенки сердца Старые ржавые насосы и ни черта большеВоскресение и жизнь Уж если умер так умер Или идея насчет страшного суда Всех вытряхнуть из могил Лазарь иди вон А пошла вонь и трюк провалился Подъем Страшный суд И все шныряют как мыши разыскивают свои печенки и селезенки и прочие потроха Чтоб все до крохи собрал за утро так твою и растак Ползолотника праху в черепе Двенадцать гран ползолотника Тройская мераКорни Келлехер пристроился к ним Все было экстракласс  сказал он  АОн искоса поглядел на них тягучим взглядом Грудь полисмена С твоим труляля труляля Как полагается  согласился мистер Кернан Что А  переспросил Корни КеллехерМистер Кернан повторил А кто это позади нас с Томом Кернаном  спросил Джон Генри Ментон  Лицо знакомоеНед Лэмберт мельком оглянулся назад Блум  ответил он  Мадам Мэрион Твиди та что была вернее она и есть певица сопрано Это жена его А вон что  протянул Джон Генри Ментон  Давненько я ее не видал Была эффектная женщина Я танцевал с ней постойка тому назад пятнадцать  семнадцать золотых годиков у Мэта Диллона в Раундтауне Было что подержать в рукахОн оглянулся в конец процессии А что он такое Чем занимается Он не был в писчебумажной торговлеПомню я с ним расплевался както вечером в кегельбанеНед Лэмберт усмехнулся Ну как же был Пропагандист промокашек Бога ради  посетовал Джон Генри Ментон  и что она вышла за этого гуся лапчатого Ведь какая была с изюминкой с огоньком Такой пока и осталась  заверил Нед Лэмберт  А он сейчас рекламный агентБольшие выпуклые глаза Джона Генри Ментона глядели неподвижно впередТележка свернула в боковую аллею Солидный мужчина выступил из засады за кустами и снял шляпу Могильщики тронули свои кепки Джон ОКоннелл  сказал мистер Пауэр довольный  Никогда не забудет другаМистер ОКоннелл молча пожал всем руки Мистер Дедал сказал Я снова с визитом к вам Любезный Саймон  произнес негромко смотритель  я совсем не желаю вас в свои завсегдатаиПоклонившись Неду Лэмберту и Джону Генри Ментону он пошел рядом с Мартином Каннингемом позвякивая связкой ключей у себя за спиной А вы не слышали историю  спросил он у всех  насчет Малкэхи из Кума Я не слыхал  ответил Мартин КаннингемВсе дружно склонили к нему цилиндры Хайнс тоже подставил ухоСмотритель подцепил большими пальцами золотую цепочку от часов и деликатно понизив голос заговорил обращаясь к их выжидательным улыбкам Рассказывают будто бы двое дружков подвыпив в один туманный вечер заявились сюда навестить могилу приятеля Спросили где тут лежит Малкэхи из Кума им объяснили куда идти Нус проплутав сколькото в тумане они находят могилу Один из пьяниц читает по буквам Теренс Малкэхи Другой в это время хлопает глазами на статую Спасителя которую вдова заказала и поставилаСмотритель похлопал глазами на один из попутных памятников Потом снова продолжал Ну поморгал он поморгал на божественную статую и говорит Да ни хрена он не похож на нашего Малкэхи Какойто сапожник делал ни малейшего сходства Вознагражденный улыбками он пропустил их вперед и принялся тихо толковать с Корни Келлехером забирая у него квитанции листая и проглядывая их на ходу Это он специально  объяснил Мартин Каннингем Хайнсу Знаю  ответил Хайнс  я раскусил Подбодрить публику  сказал Мартин Каннингем  Из чистой доброты ничего другогоМистера Блума восхищала осанистая фигура смотрителя С ним все хотят быть в хороших отношениях Глубоко порядочный человек Джон ОКоннелл отличной выпечки Ключи  как реклама для Ключчи  нет опасения что ктото сбежит на выходе не проверяем Хабеат корпус После похорон надо заняться этой рекламой Кажется я написал Боллсбридж на том конверте которым прикрыл листок когда она вдруг вошла а я писал Марте Еще застрянет как неверно заадресованное Не мешало бы побриться Щетина седая Это первый признак когда волос седеет у корней Еще характер портится И в седых волосах уж блестит серебро Интересно что чувствует его жена Как у него хватило духу сделать комуто предложение Пошли будешь жить на кладбище Огорошить ее этим Сначала может это ее возбудит Смерть в ухажерах Тут всюду ночные тени роятся при таком множестве мертвецов Тени могил когда скрипят гроба и Дэниэл ОКоннелл наверно он потомок его кто ж это уверял будто он был со странностями и любвеобилен на редкость но все равно великий католик как огромный гигант во тьме Блуждающие огоньки Могильные газы Ей надо отвлекать мысли от этого а то не сможет зачать Женщины особенно впечатлительны Рассказать ей в постели историю с привидениями чтоб заснула Ты видела когданибудь привидение Знаешь а я видел Стояла тьма хоть глаз выколи Часы пробили двенадцать Но могут и целоваться со всем пылом стоит только настроить В Турции шлюхи на кладбищах Если взять молодую чему угодно научитсяМожешь тут подцепить молодую вдовушку Мужчинам такое нравится Любовь среди могил Ромео Обостряет удовольствие В расцвете смерти объяты мы жизнью Крайности сходятся Танталовы муки для бедных мертвецов Запахи жареных бифштексов для голодных Гложущих собственные потроха Желание подразнить других Молли хотелось заняться любовью перед окном Как бы там ни было восемь детей у негоОн тут насмотрелся вдоволь на уходящих в землю укладывает ими участок за участком вокруг Святые поля Больше было бы места если хоронить стояСидя или же на коленях не выйдет Стоя В один прекрасный день оползень или что вдруг голова показывается наружу и протянутая рука Тут вся земля кругом наверное как соты продолговатые ячейки Содержит все в чистоте бордюры трава подрезана Майор Гэмбл называет Иеронимову Гору мой сад А что верно Должны быть сонные цветы Мастянский говорил в Китае гигантские маки на кладбищах дают самый лучший опиум Ботанический сад тут недалеко Кровь впитывается в землю дает новую жизнь Та же идея у тех евреев что говорят убили христианского мальчика Каждому человеку своя цена Хорошо сохранившийся жирный труп джентльменаэпикурейца необходим для вашего сада Цена дешевая Туша Вильяма Уилкинсона ревизора и бухгалтера недавно скончавшегося три фунта тринадцать и шесть Рады служить вамМожно ручаться почва тучнеет на славу от трупного удобрения кости мясо ногти Начинка склепов Жуть Делаются зеленые и розовые разлагаются В сырой земле гниют быстро Тощие старики дольше держатсяСтановятся не то сальные не то творожистые Потом чернеют сочатся черной вонючей патокой Потом высыхают Мотыльки смерти Конечно клетки или что там есть живут дальше Изменяются но по сути вечные Нечем кормиться кормятся собойНа них ведь должна развестись чертова погибель червей Должно быть в почве так и кишат так и кружат Вскрюжат голову бедняжке Щечки в ямочках кудряшки А вид у него вполне бодрый Дает ему ощущение власти видеть как все уходят в землю раньше него Интересно как он смотрит на жизнь Не прочь пошутить отвести душу Анекдотсообщение Сперджен отправился на небо сегодня утром в  часа Сейчас  вечера время закрытия Еще не прибыл Петр Мертвецы и сами по крайней мере мужчины вполне бы послушали анекдотец а женщинам бы разузнать насчет моды Сочную грушу или дамский пунш крепкий сладкий горячий Предохраняет от сырости Смеяться полезно так что это самое лучшее когда в таком стиле Могильщики в Гамлете говорит о глубоком знании наших душ О мертвых нельзя шутить по крайней мере два года      Сначала чтобы кончился траур Трудно представить себе его похороны Как будто каламбур Говорят прочесть собственный некролог будешь жить дольше Дает второе дыхание Новый контракт на жизнь Сколько у нас на завтра  спросил смотритель Двое  ответил Корни Келлехер  В полодиннадцатого и в одиннадцатьСмотритель сунул бумаги в карман Колеса каталки остановилисьПрисутствующие разделившись пройдя осторожно между могил стали по обе стороны ямы Могильщики сняли гроб и поставили его носом на край подведя снизу веревкиХороним его Днесь Цезаря пришли мы хоронить Его мартовские или июньские иды Он не знает кто тут и ему все равноНет а этото еще кто этот долговязый раззява в макинтоше Нет правда кто хочу знать Нет грош я дам за то чтоб узнать Всегда ктонибудь объявится о ком ты отродясь не слыхивал Человек может всю жизнь прожить в одиночестве А что может Но всетаки ктото ему нужен кто бы его зарыл хотя могилу он себе может выкопать сам Это мы все делаем Только человек погребает Нет еще муравьи Первое что всех поражает Хоронить мертвыхГоворят Робинзон Крузо был на самом деле Тогда стало быть Пятница его и похоронил Каждая Пятница хоронит четверг если так поглядетьО бедный Крузо РобинзонИ как же смог прожить там онБедный Дигнам Последнее земное ложе его в этом ящике Как подумаешь сколько их кажется такой тратой дерева Все равно сгложут А можно было бы придумать нарядный гроб с какойто скажем панелью чтобы с нее соскальзывали Эх только будут возражать чтобы их хоронили в изпод другого Страшная привередливость Положите меня в родной земле Горсточку глины из Палестины Только мать и мертворожденного могут похоронить в одном гробу А я понимаю почему Понимаю Чтобы его защищать как можно дольше даже в земле Дом ирландца его гроб Бальзамирование в катакомбах мумии тот же смыслМистер Блум стоял поодаль со шляпой в руках считая обнаженные головыДвенадцать я тринадцатый Нет Чудик в макинтоше тринадцатый Число смерти И откуда он выскочил В часовне не было за это я поручусьГлупейший предрассудок насчет тринадцатиХороший твид мягкий у Неда Лэмберта на костюме Красноватая искра У меня был похожий когда жили на Западной Ломбардстрит Раньше он был большой щеголь Три раза на день менял костюм А мой серый надо снести к Мизайесу чтоб перелицевал Эге Да он перекрашен Надо бы его жене хотя у него нет жены или там хозяйке повыдергивать эти ниткиГроб уходил из вида могильщики спускали его крепко уперев ноги на подгробных подпорах Они выпрямились и отошли и все обнажили головыДвадцатьПаузаЕсли бы все мы вдруг стали кемто ещеВдалеке проревел осел К дождю Не такой уж осел Говорят никогда не увидишь мертвого осла Стыд смерти Прячутся Бедный папа тоже уехалЛегкий ветерок овевал обнаженные головы шепча Шепот Мальчик возле могилы держал обеими руками венок покорно глядя в открытый черный провалМистер Блум стал позади осанистого и благожелательного смотрителя Фрак хорошо пошит Прикидывает наверно кто из нас следующий Что ж это долгий отдых Ничего не чувствуешь Только сам момент чувствуешь Должно быть чертовски неприятно Сперва не можешь поверить Должно быть ошибка это не меня Спросите в доме напротив Обождите я хотел то Я не успел этоПотом затемненная палата для смертников Им хочется света Кругом перешептываются Вы не хотите позвать священника Потом бессвязная речь мысли путаются Бред все что ты скрывал всю жизнь Борьба со смертью Это у него не естественный сон Оттяните нижнее веко Смотрят а нос заострился а челюсть отвисла а подошвы ног пожелтели Заберите подушку и пусть кончается на полу все равно обречен На той картинке смерть грешника ему дьявол показывает женщину И он умирающий в рубашке тянется ее обнятьПоследний акт Лючии Ужель никогда не увижу тебя Бамм Испустил духОтошел наконецто Люди слегка поговорят о тебе  и забудут Не забывайте молиться о нем Поминайте его в своих молитвах Даже Парнелл День плюща отмирает Потом и сами за ним один за другим все в ямуМы сейчас молимся за упокой его души Три к носу брат и не угоди в адПриятная перемена климата Со сковородки жизни в огонь чистилищаА думает он когданибудь про яму ждущую его самого Говорят про это думаешь если внезапно дрожь проберет в жаркий день Ктото прошел по твоей могиле Предупреждение скоро на выход За другими Моя в том конце к Фингласу участок что я купил Мама бедная мамочка и малютка РудиМогильщики взялись за лопаты и начали швырять на гроб тяжелые комья глины Мистер Блум отвернул лицо А если он все это время был жив БррВот это уж было бы ужасно Нет нет он мертвый конечно Конечно мертвыйВ понедельник умер Надо бы какойто закон чтобы протыкать им сердце для верности или электрический звонок в гробу или телефон и какуюнибудь решетку для доступа воздуха Сигнал бедствия Три дня Летом это довольно долго Пожалуй лучше сразу сплавлять как только уверились что неГлина падала мягче Начинают забывать С глаз долой из сердца вонСмотритель отошел в сторону и надел шляпу С него хватит Провожающие понемногу приободрились и неприметно один за другим тоже покрывали головы Мистер Блум надел шляпу и увидел как осанистая фигура споро прокладывает путь в лабиринте могил Спокойно с хозяйской уверенностью пересекал он поля скорби Хайнс чтото строчит в блокнотике А имена Он же их все знает Нет идет ко мне Я тут записываю имена и фамилии  полушепотом сказал Хайнс  Ваше как имя Я не совсем помню На эл  отвечал мистер Блум  Леопольд И можете еще записать Маккоя Он меня попросил Чарли  произнес Хайнс записывая  Знаю его Он когдато работал во ФрименеВерно работал до того как устроился в морге под началом Луиса БернаХорошая мысль чтобы доктора делали посмертные вскрытия Выяснить то что им кажется они и так знают Он скончался от Вторника Намазал пятки Смылся прихватив выручку с нескольких объявлений Чарли ты моя душка Потому он меня и попросил Ладно кому от этого вред Я все сделал Маккой Спасибо старина премного обязан Вот и пускай будет обязан  а мне ничего не стоит И скажитека  продолжал Хайнс  вы не знаете этого типа ну там вон стоял еще на немОн поискал глазами вокруг Макинтош  сказал мистер Блум  Да я его видел Куда же он делся Макинтош  повторил Хайнс записывая  Не знаю кто он такой Это его фамилияОн двинулся дальше оглядываясь по сторонам Да нет  начал мистер Блум оборачиваясь задержать его  Нет же ХайнсНе слышит А Куда же тот испарился Ни следа Ну что же из всех ктоНе видали Ка е два эл Стал невидимкой Господи что с ним сталосьСедьмой могильщик подошел к мистеру Блуму взять лежавшую рядом с ним лопату О извинитеОн поспешно посторонилсяБурая сырая глина уже видна была в яме Она поднималась Вровень Гора сырых комьев росла все выше росла и могильщики опустили свои лопаты На минуту все опять обнажили головы Мальчик прислонил венок сбоку свояк положил свой сверху Могильщики надели кепки и понесли обглиненные лопаты к тележке Постукали лезвием по земле очистили Один нагнулся и снял с черенка длинный пучок травы Еще один отделился от товарищей и медленно побрел прочь взяв на плечо оружие с синеблещущим лезвием Другой в головах могилы медленно сматывал веревки на которых спускали гроб Его пуповина Свояк отвернувшись чтото вложил в его свободную рукуБезмолвная благодарность Сочувствуем сэр такое горе Кивок ПонимаюВот лично вамУчастники похорон разбредались медленно бесцельно окольными тропками задерживались у могил прочесть имена Давайте кругом мимо могилы вождя  предложил Хайнс  Время есть Давайте  сказал мистер ПауэрОни свернули направо следуя медленному течению своих мыслей Тусклый голос мистера Пауэра с суеверным почтением произнес Говорят его вовсе и нет в могиле Гроб был набит камнями И что он еще вернется когданибудьХайнс покачал головой Парнелл никогда не вернется  сказал он  Он там все то что было смертного в нем Мир праху егоМистер Блум шагал в одиночестве под деревьями меж опечаленных ангелов крестов обломанных колонн фамильных склепов каменных надежд молящихся с поднятыми горе взорами мимо старой Ирландии рук и сердец Разумнее тратить эти деньги на добрые дела для живых Молитесь за упокой души егоКак будто ктото на самом деле Спустили в яму и кончено Как уголь по желобу Потом для экономии времени за всех чохом День поминовенияДвадцать седьмого я буду у него на могиле Садовнику десять шиллинговВыпалывает сорняки Сам старик Сгорбленный в три погибели щелкает своими ножницами В могиле одной ногой Ушедший от нас Покинувший этот мир Как будто они по своей воле Всех выкинули пинком Сыгравший в ящикИнтересней если б писали кто они были Имярек колесник Я был коммивояжер сбывал коркский линолеум Я выплачивал по пять шиллингов за фунт Или женщина с кастрюлей Я стряпала добрую ирландскую похлебку Как там это стихотворение эклогия на сельском кладбище написал то ли Вордсворт то ли Томас Кемпбелл У протестантов говорят обрел вечный покой Или старый доктор Моррен великая исцелительница позвала его к себе Для них это Божий надел Очень милая загородная резиденция Заново оштукатурена и покрашена Идеальное местечко чтобы спокойно покурить и почитать Черч таймсОбъявления о свадьбах никогда не берут в веночек Проржавелые венки гирлянды из фольги висели на крестах и оградках Вот это выгодней Хотя цветы более поэтично А такое надоедает не вянет никогда Совершенно

красным как настоящее сердце Ирландия была ему посвящена или в этом роде Выглядит страшно недовольным За что мне такое наказание Птицы слетались бы и клевали как там про мальчика с корзинкой плодов но он сказал нет потому что они бы испугались мальчика Аполлон это былСколько их И все когдато разгуливали по Дублину В бозе почившие И мы были прежде такими как ты теперьИ потом как можно всех запомнить

съежившегося мальчишку за шиворот а остальные врассыпную бросились наутек из вестибюля и вниз по лестнице Сквозняк с мягким шелестом подхватил листки и они описав голубые закорючки в воздухе приземлились под столом Я не виноват сэр Это тот длинный меня впихнул сэр Да вышвырни его и закрой ту дверь  сказал редактор  А то целый ураган поднялсяЛенехан нагибаясь и покряхтывая начал подбирать

Гряди  возгласил он  Перед тобою весь мирДжДжОМоллой взял листки у Ленехана из рук и начал читать осторожными дуновениями отделяя их друг от друга не говоря ни слова Он устроит эту рекламу  сказал профессор глядя через очки в черной оправе поверх занавески  Полюбуйтесь как эти юные бездельники за ним увязались Где Покажите  закричал Ленехан подбегая к окнуУЛИЧНОЕ ШЕСТВИЕОба посмеялись глядя

принялся карикатурить мазурку через всю комнату мимо камина скольженьями устремляясь к ОМоллою который опустил листки в готовно протянутые его руки Что это здесь  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд словно очнувшись  А где остальные двое Кто  обернулся профессор  Они отправились в Овал малость выпитьТам Падди Хупер а с ним Джек Холл Приехали вчера вечером Пошли раз так  решил Майлс Кроуфорд  Где моя

помолчать Моя новейшая загадка    произнес негромко ДжДжОМоллой  Это звучит куда благородней чем британская или брикстонская Слова чемто напоминают про масло подливаемое в огоньМайлс Кроуфорд мощно выпустил в потолок первую струю дыма Это точно  сказал он  Мы и есть масло Вы и я  масло в огонь И шансов у нас еще меньше чем у снежного кома в адском пеклеВЕЛИЧИЕ ЧЬЕ ИМЯ  РИМ Одну минуту  сказал профессор Макхью подняв два спокойных когтя  Не следует поддаваться словам звучанию слов Мы думаем о Риме имперском императорском императивномОн сделал паузу и ораторски простер руки вылезающие из обтрепанных и грязных манжет Но какова была их цивилизация Бескрайна согласен но и бездушна  сточные канавы Евреи в пустыне или на вершине горы говорили Отрадно быть здесь Поставим жертвенник Иегове А

озирался кругом и говорил Отрадно быть здесь Соорудим же ватерклозет  Каковой неукоснительно и сооружали  сказал Ленехан  Наши древние далекие предки как можно прочесть в первой главе книги Пития

обмахивать лицо его шелестящими листочкамиПрофессор возвращаясь на место мимо подшивок тронул легонько рукою распущенные галстуки Стивена и мистера ОМэддена Берка Париж в прошлом и настоящем Вы выглядите как коммунары Как те парни что взорвали Бастилию  сказал ДжДжОМоллой с мягкой иронией  Или может это как раз вы с ним пристрелили генералгубернатора Финляндии Судя по виду вы бы вполне могли

подкрепляя слова энергичным жестом  Вот погодите Мы парализуем Европу как выражался Игнатий Галлахер когда он мытарствовал подрабатывал маркером на бильярде в отеле Кларенс Галлахер вот это был

Ленехан  И даже очень Преподнес им все на тарелочке  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Всю эту дьявольскую историюКошмар от которого ты никогда не проснешься Я видел сам  с гордостью произнес редактор  Я сам был при этомДик Адаме золотое сердце добрейший из всех мерзавцев кого только Господь сподобил родиться в Корке  и яЛенехан отвесил поклон воображаемой фигуре и объявил Мадам а там Адам А роза упала на лапу Азора Всю историю  восклицал Майлс Кроуфорд  Старушка с Принсстрит оказалась первой И был там плач и скрежет зубов Все изза одного рекламного объявления Грегор Грэй сделал эскиз для него и сразу на этом пошел в гору А потом Падди Хупер обработал Тэй Пэя и тот взял его к себе в Стар Сейчас он у Блюменфельда Вот это пресса Вот это талантПайетт Вот кто им всем был папочкой Отец сенсационной

главному судье Дада  с живостью подхватил ДжДжОМоллой  Леди Дадли шла домой через парк хотела поглядеть как там прошлогодний циклон повалил деревья и решила купить открытку с видом Дублина А открыткато эта оказалась выпущенной в честь то ли Джо Брэди то ли Главного или Козьей Шкуры И продавали у самой резиденции вицекороля можете себе представить Теперешние годятся только в департамент мелкого вздора  продолжал свое Майлс Кроуфорд  Тьфу Что пресса что суд Где вы теперь найдете такого юриста как те прежние как Уайтсайд как Айзек Батт как среброустый ОХейган А Эх чушь собачья Тьфу Гроша ломаного не стоятОн смолк но нервная и презрительная гримаса еще продолжала змеиться на губах у негоЗахотела бы какаянибудь поцеловать эти губы Как знать А зачем тогда ты это писалСКЛАД И ЛАДГубы клубы Губы  это какимто образом клубы так что ли Или же клубы  это губы Чтото такое должно быть Клубы тубы любы зубы грубы Рифмы два человека одеты одинаково выглядят одинаково по двое парами

подчернотою ночи губы клубы могила пленила Говорите лишь за себя  сказал мистер ОМэдден БеркДОВЛЕЕТ ДНЕВИДжДжОМоллой со слабою улыбкою принял вызов Дорогой Майлс  проговорил он отбрасывая свою сигарету  вы сделали неверные выводы из моих слов В настоящий момент на меня не возложена защита третьей профессии  профессии но все же резвость ваших коркских ног слишком заносит вас Отчего нам не вспомнить Генри Граттана и Флуда или Демосфена или Эдмунда Берка Мы все знаем Игнатия Галлахера и его шефа из Чейплизода Хармсуорта издававшего желтые газетенки а также и его американского кузена из помойного листка в стиле Бауэри не говоря уж про Новости Падди Келли Приключения Пью и нашего недремлющего друга Скиберинского орла Зачем непременно вспоминать такого мастера адвокатских речей как Уайтсайд Довлеет дневи газета егоОТЗВУКИ ДАВНИХ ДНЕЙ Граттан и Флуд писали вот для этой самой газеты  выкрикнул редактор ему в лицо  Патриоты и добровольцы А теперь вы где Основана в мДоктор Льюкас А кого сейчас можно сравнить с Джоном Филпотом КаррэномТьфу Ну что ж  сказал ДжДжОМоллой  вот скажем королевский адвокат Буш Буш  повторил редактор  Что же согласен Буш я согласен У него в крови это есть Кендал Буш то есть я хочу сказать Сеймур Буш Он бы уже давно восседал в судьях  сказал профессор  если бы не Ну ладно не будемДжДжОМоллой повернулся к Стивену и тихо с расстановкой сказал Я думаю самая отточенная фраза какую я слышал в жизни вышла из уст Сеймура Буша Слушалось дело о братоубийстве то самое дело Чайлдса Буш защищал егоИ мне в ушную полость влил настойКстати как же он узнал это Ведь он умер во сне Или эту другую историю про зверя с двумя спинами И какова же она была  спросил профессор   Он говорил о принципе правосудия на основе доказательств согласно римскому праву  сказал ОМоллой  Он противопоставлял его более древнему Моисееву закону   и здесь напомнил про Моисея Микеланджело в Ватикане Мда Несколько тщательно подобранных слов  возвестил Ленехан  ТишинаПоследовала пауза ДжДжОМоллой извлек свой портсигарНапрасно замерли Какаянибудь ерундаВестник задумчиво вынул спички и закурил сигаруПозднее я часто думал оглядываясь назад на эти странные дни не это ли крохотное действие столь само по себе пустое это чирканье этой спички определило впоследствии всю судьбу двух наших существованийОТТОЧЕННАЯ ФРАЗАДжДжОМоллой продолжал оттеняя каждое слово Он сказал о нем это музыка застывшая в мраморе каменное изваяние рогатое и устрашающее божественное в человеческой форме это вечный символ мудрости и прозрения который достоин жить если только достойно жить чтолибо исполненное воображением или рукою скульптора во мраморе духовно преображенном и преображающем Волнистое движение его гибкой руки эхом сопровождало фразу Блестяще  тотчас отозвался Майлс Кроуфорд Божественное вдохновение  промолвил мистер ОМэдден Берк А вам понравилось  спросил ДжДжОМоллой у СтивенаСтивен плененный до глубины красотой языка и жеста лишь молча покраснел Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара и ДжДжОМоллой протянул портсигар Майлсу Кроуфорду Ленехан как и прежде дал им прикурить а потом уцепил трофей говоря Премногус благодаримусВЫСОКОНРАВСТВЕННЫЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК Профессор Мэйдженнис мне говорил про вас  обратился ОМоллой к Стивену  Скажите по правде что вы думаете обо всей этой толпе герметистов поэтов опалового безмолвия с верховным мистом АЭ Все началось с этой дамы Блаватской Уж это была замысловатая штучка В одном интервью которое он дал какомуто янки АЭ рассказывал как вы однажды явились к нему чуть свет и стали допытываться о планах сознанияМэйдженнис считает что вы должно быть решили попросту разыграть АЭ Он человек высочайшей нравственности МэйдженнисГоворил обо мне Но что он сказал Что он сказал Что он сказал обо мне Нет не спрошу Спасибо  сказал профессор Макхью отклоняя от себя портсигар  Погодите минуту Позвольте я коечто скажу Прекраснейшим образцом ораторского искусства какой я слышал была речь Джона ФТэйлора на заседании университетского исторического общества Сначала говорил судья Фицгиббон теперешний глава апелляционного суда а обсуждали они нечто довольно новое по тем временам эссе где ратовалось за возрождение ирландского языкаОн обернулся к Майлсу Кроуфорду и сказал Вы ведь знаете Джеральда Фицгиббона так что можете себе представить стиль его речи По слухам он заседает с Тимом Хили  вставил ДжДжОМоллой  в административной комиссии колледжа Тринити Он заседает с милым крошкой в детском нагрудничке  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Валяйте дальше Ну и что Прошу заметить  продолжал профессор  что это была речь опытного оратора с безупречной дикцией исполненная учтивого высокомерия и изливающая не скажу чашу гнева но скорей горделивое презрение к новому движению Тогда это было новым движением Мы были слабы и стало быть ни на что не годныНа мгновение он сомкнул свои тонкие длинные губы но стремясь продолжать поднес широко отставленную руку к очкам и коснувшись черной оправы подрагивающими пальцами безымянным и большим слегка передвинул фокусИМПРОВИЗАЦИЯНарочито будничным тоном он обратился к ДжДжОМоллою А Тэйлор надо вам знать явился туда больной встал с постели И я не верю что он заранее приготовил речь потому что во всем зале не было ни единой стенографистки Лицо у него было смуглое исхудалое с лохматой бородой во все стороны На шее болтался какойто шарф а сам он выглядел едва ли не умирающим хотя таковым и не былВзгляд его тут же хотя и без торопливости двинулся от ДжДжОМоллоя к Стивену и тут же потом обратился книзу будто ища чтото За склоненною головой обнаружился ненакрахмаленный полотняный воротничок засаленный от редеющих волос Все так же ища он сказал Когда Фицгиббон закончил речь Джон ФТэйлор взял ответное слово И вот что он говорил вкратце и насколько могу припомнитьТвердым движением он поднял голову Глаза снова погрузились во вспоминание Неразумные моллюски плавали в толстых линзах туда и сюда ища выходаОн начал Господин председатель леди и джентльмены Велико было мое восхищение словами с которыми только что обратился к молодежи Ирландии мой ученый друг Мне чудилось будто я перенесся в страну очень отдаленную от нашей и в эпоху очень далекую от нынешней будто я нахожусь в Древнем Египте и слушаю речь некоего первосвященника той земли обращенную к юному Моисею Его слушатели все внимание застыли с сигаретами в пальцах и дым от них восходил тонкими побегами распускавшимися по мере его речи Пусть дым от алтарей Близятся благородные слова Посмотрим А если бы самому попробовать силы И чудилось мне будто я слышу как в голосе этого египетского первосвященника звучат надменность и горделивость И услышал я слова его и смысл их открылся мне ИЗ ОТЦОВ ЦЕРКВИОткрылось мне что только доброе может стать хуже если бы это было абсолютное добро или вовсе бы не было добром то оно не могло бы стать хуже А черт побери Это же из святого Августина Отчего вы евреи не хотите принять нашей культуры и нашей религии и нашего языка Вы  племя кочующих пастухов мы  могущественный народ У вас нет городов и нет богатств наши города словно людские муравейники и наши барки триремы и квадриремы груженные всевозможными товарами бороздят воды всего известного мира Вы едва вышли из первобытного состояния у нас есть литература священство многовековая история и государственные законы НилРебенок  мужчина  изваяниеНа берегу Нила прислужницы преклонили колена тростниковая люлька  муж искусный в битве  каменнорогий каменнобородый сердце каменное Вы поклоняетесь темному безвестному идолу в наших храмах таинственных и великолепных обитают Изида и Озирис Гор и Амон Ра Ваш удел  рабство страх унижения наш  громы и моря Израиль слаб и малочисленны сыны его Египет  несметное воинство и грозно его оружие Бродягами и поденщиками зоветесь вы от нашего имени содрогается мир Беззвучная голодная отрыжка ворвалась в его речь Повышением голоса он отважно поборол ее Но леди и джентльмены если бы юноша Моисей внял этой речи и принял бы этот взгляд на жизнь если бы он склонил свою голову склонил свою волю склонил дух свой пред этим надменным поучением то никогда бы не вывел он избранный народ из дома рабства и не последовал бы днем за столпом облачным Никогда бы не говорил он с Предвечным средь молний на вершине Синая и не сошел бы с нее сияя отсветами боговдохновения на лице неся в руках скрижали закона выбитые на языке изгоев Он смолк и оглядел их наслаждаясь молчаниемЗЛОВЕЩИЙ ЗНАК  ДЛЯ НЕГОДжДжОМоллой не без сожаленья заметил И все же он умер не ступив на землю обетованную Внезапная  в  тот  миг  хотя  и  от  продолжительной  болезни  нередко  задолго  сжижаемая  кончина  изрек Ленехан  И позади у него лежало великое будущееПослышалось как стадо босых ног ринулось через вестибюль и по лестнице вверх Вот что такое искусство речи  сказал профессор не встретив ничьего возраженияУнесено ветром Людские скопища в Моллахмасте и в Таре королевской На целые мили  ушные полости Громовые речи трибуна звучат  и развеиваются ветром Народ обретал убежище в его голосе Умершие звуки Акашахроника где все что происходило когданибудь гденибудь где угодно Обожайте его и восхваляйте  но с меня хватитУ меня есть деньги Джентльмены  произнес Стивен  Следующим пунктом повестки дня позвольте внести предложение о переносе заседания в другое место Вы меня изумляете Надеюсь это не пустая любезность на французский манер  спросил мистер ОМэдден Берк  Ибо мыслю сие есть время когда винный кувшин выражаясь метафорически особливо приятствен в древней вашей гостинице Быть по сему и настоящим решительно решено Все кто за говори в глаза  возгласил Ленехан  Прочим молчок Объявляю предложение принятым В какое же именно питейное заведение Подаю свой голос за МуниОн возглавил шествие поучая Мы резко отвергнем возлияния крепких напитков разве не так Так да не так Ни под каким видомМистер ОМэдден Берк шедший за ним вплотную произнес делая соратнический выпад зонтом Рази Макдуф Весь в папашу  воскликнул редактор хлопнув Стивена по плечу  Двинулись Где эти чертовы ключиОн порылся в кармане и вытащил смятые листки Ящур Помню Все будет в порядке Пойдет Где же они Все в порядкеОн снова сунул листки в карман и ушел в кабинетБУДЕМ НАДЕЯТЬСЯДжДжОМоллой собравшись последовать за ним тихо сказал Стивену Надеюсь вы доживете пока это напечатают Майлс одну минуткуОн прошел в кабинет затворив дверь за собой Пойдемте Стивен  позвал профессор  Это было блестяще не правда ли Прямотаки пророческие виденья   Разграбление бурной Трои Царства мира сего Былые властители Средиземноморья  ныне феллахиПервый мальчишкагазетчик стуча пятками промчался по лестнице и ринулся мимо них

с ним в ногу  Кроуфорд нас догонитЕще один мальчишка пронесся мимо них вопя на бегу Специальный выпуск скачкиДОБРЫЙ ДРЯХЛЫЙ ДУБЛИНДублинцы Две дублинские весталки  начал Стивен  престарелые и набожные прожили пятьдесят и пятьдесят три года на Фамболлилейн Это где такое  спросил профессор Неподалеку от БлэкпиттсаСырая ночь с голодными запахами пекарни У стены Пухлое лицо поблескивает под дешевою шалью Неистовые сердца Акашахроника Поживей милокВперед Попробуй рискни Да будет жизнь Они желают посмотреть панораму Дублина с вершины колонны Нельсона У них накоплено три шиллинга десять пенсов в красной жестяной копилке в виде почтового ящика Они вытряхивают оттуда трехпенсовые монетки и шестипенсовики а пенсы выуживают помогая себе лезвием ножа Два шиллинга три пенса серебром один шиллинг семь пенсов медью Они надевают шляпки и воскресные платья берут с собой зонтики на случай дождя Мудрые девы  сказал профессор МакхьюЖИЗНЬ БЕЗ ПРИКРАС Они покупают на шиллинг четыре пенса грудинки и четыре ломтя формового хлеба у мисс Кейт Коллинз хозяйки Северных Столовых на Мальборострит Потом они покупают двадцать и четыре спелые сливы у девчонки торгующей у самого подножия колонны Нельсона чтобы утолять жажду после грудинки И заплатив две трехпенсовые монетки джентльмену у турникета они медленно начинают взбираться по винтовой лестнице кряхтя подбадривая друг друга пугаясь темных мест борясь с одышкой переспрашивая одна другую а грудинка у вас вознося хвалы Господу и Пречистой Деве грозясь повернуть назад и выглядывая в смотровые щелиУ уфф слава Богу Мы и понятия не имели что это так высокоЗовут их Энн Карнс и Флоренс Маккейб Энн Карнс страдает радикулитом и растирается от него лурдской водой которую ей дала одна леди а та получила бутылочку от одного монахапассиониста У Флоренс Маккейб каждую субботу на ужин свиные ножки и бутылка двойного пива Антитезис  молвил профессор кивая дважды  Девывесталки Так и вижу их Но что же наш друг там мешкаетОн обернулсяСтая стремглав летящих мальчишек неслась вниз по ступеням разлетаясь во все стороны вопя размахивая белыми листами газет За ними на лестнице появился Майлс Кроуфорд в нимбе шляпы вокруг малиновой физиономии продолжая беседовать с ДжДжОМоллоем Нагоняйте  крикнул ему профессор и помахал рукойЗатем он снова зашагал рядом со СтивеномВОЗВРАЩЕНИЕ БЛУМА Дада  сказал он  я их вижуМистер Блум весь запыхавшийся попавший в оголтелый водоворот мальчишекгазетчиков возле редакций Айриш католик и Дублин пенни джорнэл воззвал Мистер Кроуфорд Минуточку Телеграф Специальный выпуск скачки Ну в чем дело  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд замедляя шагВыкрик газетчика раздался перед самым носом мистера Блума Ужасная трагедия в Рэтмайнсе Ребенка защемило тискамиИНТЕРВЬЮ С РЕДАКТОРОМ Все об этой рекламе  начал мистер Блум проталкиваясь к ступеням отдуваясь и вынимая вырезку из кармана  Я только что говорил с мистером Ключчи Он сказал что закажет на два месяца А там посмотрит Но он еще хочет заметку в Телеграфе в субботнем розовом чтобы привлечь вниманиеЯ уже говорил советнику Наннетти он хочет такую же как была в Килкенни пипл если еще не слишком поздно Я бы мог ее взять в Национальной Библиотеке Понимаете дом ключей Его фамилия Ключчи получается игра слов Но он можно считать обещал что закажет Но он только хочет чтобы это немножко раздуть Что мне ему передать мистер КроуфордПМЖ Передайте что он может поцеловать меня в жопу  отрезал Майлс Кроуфорд сделав выразительный жест  Вот так в натуре и передайтеСлегка нервничает Надо поосторожней Все двинулись выпить Рука об руку Морская фуражка Ленехана поспешает на дармовщинку Как всегда подольстился Интересно кто всех подбил молодой Дедал что ли Сегодня на нем вполне приличные башмаки В последний раз как я его видел у него пятки высвечивали И гдето вляпался в грязь Беззаботный малый Что же он делал в Айриштауне Что же  сказал мистер Блум снова переводя взгляд на редактора  Если я достану эскиз стоит помоему поместить маленькую заметку Думаю он даст это объявление Я ему передамПМБИЖ Он может поцеловать мою благородную ирландскую жопу  громогласно объявил Майлс Кроуфорд  Совершенно в любое время так вот и передайтеИ покуда мистер Блум стоял взвешивая положение и нерешительно улыбаясь он двинулся дальше своей подергивающейся походкойВ ПОИСКАХ ССУДЫ   Джек  сказал он поднося руку к подбородку  Я и сам вот посюда Тоже крупные передряги Не далее как на прошлой неделе разыскивал кто бы дал поручительство под мой вексель Мне очень жаль Джек Будь хоть малейшая возможность Если бы мог гденибудь найти я бы со всей душойДжДжОМоллой кисло поморщился и молча зашагал дальше Они нагнали остальных и пошли рядом с ними И когда они съели свою грудинку и хлеб и вытерли все двадцать пальцев о бумагу от хлеба тогда они подошли поближе к перилам Тут коечто для вас  пояснил профессор Майлсу Кроуфорду  Две дублинские старушки на вершине колонны НельсонаНУ И КОЛОННА  ВОТ ЧТО СКАЗАЛА ПЕРВАЯ ИЗ ВЗОБРАВШИХСЯ Это свежо  одобрил Майлс Кроуфорд  Это материал Выбрались на гулянье сапожников в Дагл Две старые плутовки а дальше что Но они боятся что колонна упадет  продолжал Стивен  Они глядят на крыши и спорят о том где какая церковь голубой купол в Рэтмайнсе Адама и Евы святого Лаврентия ОТула Но когда смотрят у них начинает кружиться голова так что они задирают платьяЛЕГКАЯ НЕОБУЗДАННОСТЬ ЭТИХ ЖЕНЩИН Полегче  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Без поэтических вольностей Мы тут в епархии архиепископа И усаживаются на свои полосатые исподние юбки взирая вверх на статую однорукого прелюбодея Однорукий прелюбодей  воскликнул профессор  Мне это нравится Я уловил мысль Я вижу что вы хотите сказатьМОЖНО ПОДУМАТЬ ДАМЫ ОДАРИВАЮТ ГРАЖДАН ДУБЛИНА СКОРОСТНЫМИ ПИЛЮЛЯМИ И БЫСТРОЛЕТНЫМИ МЕТЕОРИТАМИ Но у них от этого затекает шея  говорил Стивен  и они так устали что уже не могут смотреть ни вверх ни вниз ни даже говорить Они ставят между собой пакет со сливами и начинают их поедать одну за другой утирая платочками сливовый сок стекающий изо рта и не спеша выплевывая косточки через перилаВ конце у него вдруг вырвался громкий молодой смех Услышав его Ленехан и мистер ОМэдден Берк обернулись и помахав им повернули наискосок в сторону Муни Это все  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд  Закончим пока они не сделали чего похужеСОФИСТ ПОРАЖАЕТ НАДМЕННУЮ ЕЛЕНУ ПРЯМЫМ ПО СОПАТКЕ СПАРТАНЦЫ СКРЕЖЕЩУТ КОРЕННЫМИ ИТАКИЙЦЫ

досталась двум окнам портового управления По сути она права Выдумывают пышные названия обычным вещамЗвучности ради Она остроумием не отличается Бывает и грубой Может выболтать что у меня на уме И всетаки не уверен Скажем она придумала что у Бена Долларда не басбаритон а басбормотон Потому что когда поет половину звуков глотает и ни слова не разберешь Чем это не остроумно Ему раньше дали прозвище Большой Бен Совсем не так остроумно как басбормотон никакого сравнения Прожорлив как альбатрос Уплел подчистую цельный говяжий филей И в выпивке удержу не знает налижется как последний

упустить бы чегоЖенщины тут же Любопытство Соляной столп Конечно он отказался потому что не он первый придумал Или еще я предложил пузырек для чернил с обманным пятном из целлулоида Егото рекламные
