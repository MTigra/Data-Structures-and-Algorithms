    -- I --Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. Heheld the bowl aloft and intoned:--INTROIBO AD ALTARE DEI.Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:--Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and theawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat andshaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair,grained and hued like pale oak.Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartly.--Back to barracks! he said sternly.He added in a preachers tone:--For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul andblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, thenpaused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calm.--Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off thecurrent, will you?He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher,gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middleages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.--The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neck.Buck Mulligans gay voice went on.--My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has aHellenic ring, hasnt it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. Wemust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twentyquid?He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:--Will he come? The jejune jesuit!Ceasing, he began to shave with care.--Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.--Yes, my love?--How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.--God, isnt he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinksyoure not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with moneyand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, youhave the real Oxford manner. He cant make you out. O, my name for youis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.He shaved warily over his chin.--He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where ishis guncase?--A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?--I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the darkwith a man I dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting ablack panther. You saved men from drowning. Im not a hero, however. Ifhe stays on here I am off.Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.--Scutter! he cried thickly.He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket, said:--Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:--The bards noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.You can almost taste it, cant you?He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, hisfair oakpale hair stirring slightly.--God! he said quietly. Isnt the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweetmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. EPI OINOPA PONTON.Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in theoriginal. THALATTA! THALATTA! She is our great sweet mother. Come andlook.Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it helooked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouthof Kingstown.--Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephensface.--The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with you.--Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.--You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying motherasked you, Buck Mulligan said. Im hyperborean as much as you. But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you ...He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerantsmile curled his lips.--But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliestmummer of them all!He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoat-sleeve. Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faintodour of wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.--Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt anda few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?--They fit well enough, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.--The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. Godknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hairstripe, grey. Youll look spiffing in them. Im not joking, Kinch. Youlook damn well when youre dressed.--Thanks, Stephen said. I cant wear them if they are grey.--He cant wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he cant wear greytrousers.He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skin.Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyes.--That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, saysyou have g.p.i. Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. Generalparalysis of the insane!He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunk.--Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleftby a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose thisface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.--I pinched it out of the skivvys room, Buck Mulligan said. It does herall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Leadhim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyes.--The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. IfWilde were only alive to see you!Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:--It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust them.--Its not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. Godknows you have more spirit than any of them.Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. Thecold steelpen.--Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairsand touch him for a guinea. Hes stinking with money and thinks yourenot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus orsome bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only worktogether we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.Cranlys arm. His arm.--And to think of your having to beg from these swine. Im the only onethat knows what you are. Why dont you trust me more? What have you upyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here Ill bringdown Seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave CliveKempthorpe.Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpes rooms. Palefaces:they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, Ishall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slitribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table,with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailorsshears. A scared calfs face gilded with marmalade. I dont want to bedebagged! Dont you play the giddy ox with me!Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. Adeaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnolds face, pushes hismower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes ofgrasshalms.To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos.--Let him stay, Stephen said. Theres nothing wrong with him except atnight.--Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. Imquite frank with you. What have you against me now?They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay onthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his armquietly.--Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.--Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I dont remember anything.He looked in Stephens face as he spoke. A light wind passed hisbrow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyes.Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:--Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeath?Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:--What? Where? I cant remember anything. I remember only ideas andsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?--You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to getmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.--Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.--You said, Stephen answered, O, ITS ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER ISBEASTLY DEAD.A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose toBuck Mulligans cheek.--Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?He shook his constraint from him nervously.--And what is death, he asked, your mothers or yours or my own? Yousaw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater andRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. Its a beastlything and nothing else. It simply doesnt matter. You wouldnt kneel downto pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Becauseyou have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only its injected the wrongway. To me its all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are notfunctioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercupsoff the quilt. Humour her till its over. You crossed her last wish indeath and yet you sulk with me because I dont whinge like some hired mutefrom Lalouettes. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didnt mean to offendthe memory of your mother.He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gapingwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:--I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.--Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.--Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.--O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland nowgrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and hefelt the fever of his cheeks.A voice within the tower called loudly:--Are you up there, Mulligan?--Im coming, Buck Mulligan answered.He turned towards Stephen and said:--Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, levelwith the roof:--Dont mope over it all day, he said. Im inconsequent. Give up themoody brooding.His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed outof the stairhead:    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD   UPON LOVES BITTER MYSTERY   FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS.Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from thestairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror ofwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of thedim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking theharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded wordsshimmering on the dim tide.A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay indeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus song: Isang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her doorwas open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went toher bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen:loves bitter mystery.Where now?Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered withmusk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in thesunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce singin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when hesang:    I AM THE BOY    THAT CAN ENJOY    INVISIBILITY.Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD.Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories besethis brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she hadapproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roastingfor her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernailsreddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts.In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within itsloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. Onme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on thetortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayedon their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TECONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT.Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!No, mother! Let me be and let me live.--Kinch ahoy!Buck Mulligans voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer upthe staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his souls cry,heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.--Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines isapologising for waking us last night. Its all right.--Im coming, Stephen said, turning.--Do, for Jesus sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all oursakes.His head disappeared and reappeared.--I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says its very clever. Touchhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.--I get paid this morning, Stephen said.--The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend usone.--If you want it, Stephen said.--Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. Well have aglorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing outof tune with a Cockney accent:    O, WONT WE HAVE A MERRY TIME,    DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE!    ON CORONATION,    CORONATION DAY!    O, WONT WE HAVE A MERRY TIME    ON CORONATION DAY!Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it thereall day, forgotten friendship?He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. SoI carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yetthe same. A servant too. A server of a servant.In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligansgowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding andrevealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across theflagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays acloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.--Well be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from thehammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled openthe inner doors.--Have you the key? a voice asked.--Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, Im choked!He howled, without looking up from the fire:--Kinch!--Its in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door hadbeen set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at thedoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table andsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set themdown heavily and sighed with relief.--Im melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... But, hush! Not aword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Wheresthe sugar? O, jay, theres no milk.Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercoolerfrom the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.--What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.--We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. Theres a lemon in thelocker.--O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycovemilk.Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:--That woman is coming up with the milk.--The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from hischair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, Icant go fumbling at the damned eggs.He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on threeplates, saying:--IN NOMINE PATRIS ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI.Haines sat down to pour out the tea.--Im giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you domake strong tea, dont you?Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an oldwomans wheedling voice:--When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when Imakes water I makes water.--By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:--SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. BEGOB, MAAM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SENDYOU DONT MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT.He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread,impaled on his knife.--Thats folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five linesof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting hisbrows:--Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?--I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.--Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?--I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of MaryAnn.Buck Mulligans face smiled with delight.--Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth andblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in ahoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  --FOR OLD MARY ANN    SHE DOESNT CARE A DAMN.    BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ...He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.The doorway was darkened by an entering form.--The milk, sir!--Come in, maam, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.An old woman came forward and stood by Stephens elbow.--Thats a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.--To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.--The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently ofthe collector of prepuces.--How much, sir? asked the old woman.--A quart, Stephen said.He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug richwhite milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measurefuland a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe amessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouchingby a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool,her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about herwhom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman,names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortalserving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, amessenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether hecould not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.--It is indeed, maam, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.--Taste it, sir, she said.He drank at her bidding.--If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhatloudly, we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust,horsedung and consumptives spits.--Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.--I am, maam, Buck Mulligan answered.--Look at that now, she said.Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voicethat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me sheslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there isof her but her womans unclean loins, of mans flesh made not in Godslikeness, the serpents prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her besilent with wondering unsteady eyes.--Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.--Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.--Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?--I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from thewest, sir?--I am an Englishman, Haines answered.--Hes English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irishin Ireland.--Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and Im ashamed I dont speak thelanguage myself. Im told its a grand language by them that knows.--Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fillus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, maam?--No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of themilkcan on her forearm and about to go.Haines said to her:--Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadnt we?Stephen filled again the three cups.--Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, its seven mornings a pint attwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these threemornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. Thats ashilling and one and two is two and two, sir.Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crustthickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began tosearch his trouser pockets.--Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thickrich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in hisfingers and cried:--A miracle!He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:--Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.--Well owe twopence, he said.--Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,sir.She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligans tenderchant:  --HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE,    MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET.He turned to Stephen and said:--Seriously, Dedalus. Im stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bringus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expectsthat every man this day will do his duty.--That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit yournational library today.--Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:--Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?Then he said to Haines:--The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.--All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honeytrickle over a slice of the loaf.Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf aboutthe loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:--I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.Conscience. Yet heres a spot.--That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced good.Buck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of tone:--Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.--Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.--Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock, said:--I dont know, Im sure.He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigour:--You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?--Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From themilkwoman or from him. Its a toss up, I think.--I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.--I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens arm.--From me, Kinch, he said.In a suddenly changed tone he added:--To tell you the Gods truth I think youre right. Damn all else theyare good for. Why dont you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Letus get out of the kip.He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown,saying resignedly:--Mulligan is stripped of his garments.He emptied his pockets on to the table.--Theres your snotrag, he said.And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, wellsimply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots.Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradictmyself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghands.--And theres your Latin quarter hat, he said.Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from thedoorway:--Are you coming, you fellows?--Im ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:--And going forth he met Butterly.Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them outand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:--Did you bring the key?--I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.--Down, sir! How dare you, sir!Haines asked:--Do you pay rent for this tower?--Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.--To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:--Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?--Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were onthe sea. But ours is the omphalos.--What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.--No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait tillI have a few pints in me first.He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoat:--You couldnt manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?--It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.--You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?--Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.Its quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfather.--What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bendingin loose laughter, said to Stephens ear:--O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!--Were always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it israther long to tell.Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.--The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.--I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA, ISNT IT?Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.--Its a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.The seas ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the Muglins.--I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with theFather.Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. Helooked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. Hemoved a dolls head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  --IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD.    MY MOTHERS A JEW, MY FATHERS A BIRD.    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE.    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY.He held up a forefinger of warning.  --IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN.He tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and, runningforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  --GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD.    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE!He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, flutteringhis winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephenand said:--We oughtnt to laugh, I suppose. Hes rather blasphemous. Im not abeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow, doesnt it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?--The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.--O, Haines said, you have heard it before?--Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.--Youre not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in thenarrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal God.--Theres only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.--Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang itopen too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his hands.--Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe oryou dont, isnt it? Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod. You dont stand for that, I suppose?--You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horribleexample of free thought.He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by hisside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. Myfamiliar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along thepath. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants thatkey. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him thekey too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.--After all, Haines began ...Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured himwas not all unkind.--After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are yourown master, it seems to me.--I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.--Italian? Haines said.A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.--And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.--Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?--The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, andthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before hespoke.--I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must thinklike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you ratherunfairly. It seems history is to blame.The proud potent titles clanged over Stephens memory the triumphof their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAMECCLESIAM: the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rarethoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass forpope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: andbehind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed andmenaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry:Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius,warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with theFather, and Valentine, spurning Christs terrene body, and the subtleAfrican heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His ownSon. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: amenace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of thechurch, Michaels host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict withtheir lances and their shields.Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. ZUT! NOM DE DIEU!--Of course Im a Britisher, Hainess voice said, and I feel as one. Idont want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.Thats our national problem, Im afraid, just now.Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,boatman.--Shes making for Bullock harbour.The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.--Theres five fathoms out there, he said. Itll be swept up that waywhen the tide comes in about one. Its nine days today.The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank baywaiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,saltwhite. Here I am.They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulliganstood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over hisshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowlyfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.--Is the brother with you, Malachi?--Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.--Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet youngthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.--Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot upnear the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, waterrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his blacksagging loincloth.Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing atHaines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at browand lips and breastbone.--Seymours back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur ofrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.--Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.--Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?--Yes.--Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto withmoney.--Is she up the pole?--Better ask Seymour that.--Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, sayingtritely:--Redheaded women buck like goats.He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.--My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. Im the ubermench. Toothless Kinchand I, the supermen.He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where hisclothes lay.--Are you going in here, Malachi?--Yes. Make room in the bed.The young man shoved himself backward through the water andreached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat downon a stone, smoking.--Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.--Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.Stephen turned away.--Im going, Mulligan, he said.--Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heapedclothes.--And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing.Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:--He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spakeZarathustra.His plump body plunged.--Well see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the pathand smiling at wild Irish.Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.--The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.--Good, Stephen said.He walked along the upwardcurving path.    LILIATA RUTILANTIUM.    TURMA CIRCUMDET.    IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM.The priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I willnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head,a seals, far out on the water, round.Usurper.    * * * * * * *--You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?--Tarentum, sir.--Very good. Well?--There was a battle, sir.--Very good. Where?The boys blank face asked the blank window.Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if notas memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blakes wingsof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and topplingmasonry, and time one livid final flame. Whats left us then?--I forget the place, sir.  B. C.--Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarredbook.--Yes, sir. And he said: ANOTHER VICTORY LIKE THAT AND WE ARE DONE FOR.That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind.From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.--You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?--End of Pyrrhus, sir?--I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.--Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrongs satchel. He curled thembetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered tothe tissue of his lips. A sweetened boys breath. Welloff people, proudthat their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.--Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong lookedround at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they willlaugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papaspay.--Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boys shoulder with the book,what is a pier.--A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of abridge. Kingstown pier, sir.Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the backbench whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever beeninnocent. All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty,Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, theirbracelets tittering in the struggle.--Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.The words troubled their gaze.--How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.For Hainess chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amidwild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? Ajester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning aclement masters praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly forthe smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other toooften heard, their land a pawnshop.Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in Argos or Julius Caesarnot been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time hasbranded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinitepossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeingthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave,weaver of the wind.--Tell us a story, sir.--O, do, sir. A ghoststory.--Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.--WEEP NO MORE, Comyn said.--Go on then, Talbot.--And the story, sir?--After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under thebreastwork of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances atthe text:  --WEEP NO MORE, WOFUL SHEPHERDS, WEEP NO MORE    FOR LYCIDAS, YOUR SORROW, IS NOT DEAD,    SUNK THOUGH HE BE BENEATH THE WATERY FLOOR ...It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.Aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated outinto the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he hadread, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow adelicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brainsabout me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and inmy minds darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy ofbrightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought ofthought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: thesoul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form offorms.Talbot repeated:  --THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT OF HIM THAT WALKED THE WAVES,    THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT ...--Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I dont see anything.--What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again,having just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also overthese craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lipsand on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of thetribute. To Caesar what is Caesars, to God what is Gods. A long lookfrom dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchslooms. Ay.    RIDDLE ME, RIDDLE ME, RANDY RO.    MY FATHER GAVE ME SEEDS TO SOW.Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.--Have I heard all? Stephen asked.--Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.--Half day, sir. Thursday.--Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabblinggaily:--A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.--O, ask me, sir.--A hard one, sir.--This is the riddle, Stephen said:    THE COCK CREW,    THE SKY WAS BLUE:    THE BELLS IN HEAVEN    WERE STRIKING ELEVEN.    TIS TIME FOR THIS POOR SOUL    TO GO TO HEAVEN.What is that?--What, sir?--Again, sir. We didnt hear.Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silenceCochrane said:--What is it, sir? We give it up.Stephen, his throat itching, answered:--The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their criesechoed dismay.A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:--Hockey!They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticksand clamour of their boots and tongues.Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing anopen copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped,recent and damp as a snails bed.He held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on theheadline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signaturewith blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.--Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them toyou, sir.Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.--Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.--Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was tocopy them off the board, sir.--Can you do them. yourself? Stephen asked.--No, sir.Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snailsbed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, asquashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained fromher own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mothersprostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was nomore: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour ofrosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampledunderfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven:and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur,with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up theearth, listened, scraped and scraped.Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves byalgebra that Shakespeares ghost is Hamlets grandfather. Sargent peeredaskance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in thelumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummeryof their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too fromthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien andmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of theworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could notcomprehend.--Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?--Yes, sir.In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for aword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hueof shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective andobjective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed himand hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. Mychildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of theirtyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.The sum was done.--It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.--Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried hiscopybook back to his bench.--You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said ashe followed towards the door the boys graceless form.--Yes, sir.In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.--Sargent!--Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards thescrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teamsand Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called tohim. He turned his angry white moustache.--What is it now? he cried continually without listening.--Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.--Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restoreorder here.And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternly:--What is the matter? What is it now?Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many formsclosed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyedhead.Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abradedleather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. Asit was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuartcoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in theirspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached toall the gentiles: world without end.A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out hisrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.--First, our little financial settlement, he said.He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. Itslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laidthem carefully on the table.--Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephens embarrassed handmoved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and moneycowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emirs turban, andthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrims hoard, dead treasure,hollow shells.A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.--Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is forshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.--Three twelve, he said. I think youll find thats right.--Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shyhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.--No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.Stephens hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbolstoo of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greedand misery.--Dont carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. Youll pull it out somewhereand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. Youll find them veryhandy.Answer something.--Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Threetimes now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in thisinstant if I will.--Because you dont save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You dontknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as Ihave. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?PUT BUT MONEY IN THY PURSE.--Iago, Stephen murmured.He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare.--He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes,but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Doyou know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from anEnglishmans mouth?The seas ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seemshistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.--That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.--Ba! Mr Deasy cried. Thats not English. A French Celt said that. Hetapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.--I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I PAIDMY WAY.Good man, good man.--I PAID MY WAY. I NEVER BORROWED A SHILLING IN MY LIFE. Can you feelthat? I OWE NOTHING. Can you?Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, BobReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, fiveweeks board. The lump I have is useless.--For the moment, no, Stephen answered.Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.--I knew you couldnt, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. Weare a generous people but we must also be just.--I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece atthe shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince ofWales.--You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. Isaw three generations since OConnells time. I remember the faminein . Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of theunion twenty years before OConnell did or before the prelates of yourcommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond inArmagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked andarmed, the planters covenant. The black north and true blue bible.Croppies lie down.Stephen sketched a brief gesture.--I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But Iam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are allIrish, all kings sons.--Alas, Stephen said.--PER VIAS RECTAS, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for itand put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.    LAL THE RAL THE RA    THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN.A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!Soft day, your honour! ... Day! ... Day! ... Two topboots jog danglingon to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.--That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice andread off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.--Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, THE DICTATES OF COMMONSENSE. Just a moment.He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by hiselbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboardslowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, theirmeek heads poised in air: lord Hastings Repulse, the duke ofWestminsters Shotover, the duke of Beauforts Ceylon, PRIX DE PARIS,. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds,backing kings colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.--Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of thisallimportant question ...Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners amongthe mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches andreek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Evenmoney the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers wehurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past themeatfaced woman, a butchers dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.Shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle.Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in amedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mothers darling whoseems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock byshock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of theslain, a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts.--Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.--I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. Its about thefoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinionson the matter.May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of LAISSEZ FAIREwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our oldindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of thechannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department ofagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman whowas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.--I dont mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.Foot and mouth disease. Known as Kochs preparation. Serum andvirus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperors horses atMurzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price.Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportantquestion. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thankingyou for the hospitality of your columns.--I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at thenext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can becured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it isregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offerto come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department.Now Im going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties,by ... intrigues by ... backstairs influence by ...He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.--Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of thejews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are thesigns of a nations decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nationsvital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we arestanding here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.Old England is dying.He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed abroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.--Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.    THE HARLOTS CRY FROM STREET TO STREET    SHALL WEAVE OLD ENGLANDS WINDINGSHEET.His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam inwhich he halted.--A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew orgentile, is he not?--They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can seethe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on theearth to this day.On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quotingprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silkhats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their fullslow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knewthe rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patienceto heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by theroadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years ofwandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.--Who has not? Stephen said.--What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fellsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.--History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?--The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All humanhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:--That is God.Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!--What? Mr Deasy asked.--A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nosetweaked between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.--I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors andmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was nobetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten yearsthe Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangersto our shore here, MacMurroughs wife and her leman, ORourke, prince ofBreffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures butnot the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I willfight for the right till the end.    FOR ULSTER WILL FIGHT    AND ULSTER WILL BE RIGHT.Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.--Well, sir, he began ...--I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long atthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong.--A learner rather, Stephen said.And here what will you learn more?Mr Deasy shook his head.--Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the greatteacher.Stephen rustled the sheets again.--As regards these, he began.--Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have thempublished at once.TELEGRAPH. IRISH HOMESTEAD.--I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editorsslightly.--That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at theCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You seeif you can get it into your two papers. What are they?--THE EVENING TELEGRAPH ...--That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have toanswer that letter from my cousin.--Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.Thank you.--Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I liketo break a lance with you, old as I am.--Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under thetrees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dubme a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.--Mr Dedalus!Running after me. No more letters, I hope.--Just one moment.--Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.--I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour ofbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that?No. And do you know why?He frowned sternly on the bright air.--Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.--Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it arattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, hislifted arms waving to the air.--She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as hestamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. Thats why.On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flungspangles, dancing coins.    * * * * * * *Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thoughtthrough my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn andseawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then hewas aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking hissconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, MAESTRODI COLOR CHE SANNO. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane,adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, ifnot a door. Shut your eyes and see.Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack andshells.

All days make their end.By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all theglad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentlemanpoet. GIA. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont,gentleman journalist. Gia. My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder. Feel.That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, withthat money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, Iwonder, or does it mean something perhaps?My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didnt. Better buy one.He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,carefully. For the rest let look who will.Behind. Perhaps there is someone.He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving throughthe air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on thecrosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.+    -- II -- Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts andfowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods roes. Most of all heliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang offaintly scented urine.Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly,righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and airwere in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.Made him feel a bit peckish.The coals were reddening.Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didnt likeher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off thehob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, itsspout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stifflyround a leg of the table with tail on high.--Mkgnao!--O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of thetable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch myhead. Prr.Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean tosee: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of hertail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on hisknees.--Milk for the pussens, he said.--Mrkgnao! the cat cried.They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than weunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel.Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I looklike to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.--Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of thechookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.--Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintivelyand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslitsnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to thedresser, took the jug Hanlons milkman had just filled for him, pouredwarmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.--Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tippedthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them theycant mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kindof feelers in the dark, perhaps.He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs withthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for amutton kidney at Buckleys. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better apork kidney at Dlugaczs. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower,then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lapbetter, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, pausedby the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread andbutter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.He said softly in the bare hall:--Im going round the corner. Be back in a minute.And when he had heard his voice say it he added:--You dont want anything for breakfast?A sleepy soft grunt answered:--Mn.No. She didnt want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh,softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedsteadjingled. Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it.Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governors auction. Got ashort knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevnathat was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and Im proud of it. Still he hadbrains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoatand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickybackpictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plastos highgrade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip ofpaper. Quite safe.On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled thehalldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gentlyover the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come backanyhow.He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of numberseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of Georges church. Be a warmday I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Blackconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldnt go in thatlight suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as hewalked in happy warmth. Bolands breadvan delivering with trays our dailybut she prefers yesterdays loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes youfeel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travelround in front of the sun, steal a days march on him. Keep it up for evernever grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land,come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedys bigmoustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awnedstreets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man,Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries ofsellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Danderalong all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on tosundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with ascroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I passon. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls herchildren home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged.Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Mollys new garters. Strings. Listen.A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.I pass.Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track ofthe sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. WhatArthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the FREEMAN leader: ahomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bankof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sunrising up in the north-west.He approached Larry ORourkes. From the cellar grating floated upthe flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted outwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the endof the city traffic. For instance MAuleys down there: n. g. as position.Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from thecattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him foran ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, mybold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching theaproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes himoff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what Im going to tellyou? Whats that, Mr ORourke? Do you know what? The Russians,theyd only be an eight oclock breakfast for the Japanese.Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing aboutpoor Dignam, Mr ORourke.Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through thedoorway:--Good day, Mr ORourke.--Good day to you.--Lovely weather, sir.--Tis all that.Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates fromthe county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, loand behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thinof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublinwithout passing a pub. Save it they cant. Off the drunks perhaps. Putdown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs anddrabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with thetown travellers. Square it you with the boss and well split the job, see?How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say tenbarrels of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passedSaint Josephs National school. Brats clamour. Windows open. Fresh airhelps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouveedoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At theirjoggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.He halted before Dlugaczs window, staring at the hanks of sausages,polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened inhis mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packedwith forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarmbreath of cooked spicy pigs blood.A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. Hestood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, callingthe items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and ahalf of Dennys sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods hisname is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followersallowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. Shedoes whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped offwith blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfedheifer.He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm atKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal wintersanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it,blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read itnearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A youngwhite heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing intheir pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders inhobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on aripemeated hindquarter, theres a prime one, unpeeled switches in theirhands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will,his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whackby whack.The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up herprime sausages and made a red grimace.--Now, my miss, he said.She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.--Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,please?Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if shewent slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in themorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stoodoutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sigheddown his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crustedtoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. Thesting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another:a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable.Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, Im lost in the wood.--Threepence, please.His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them onthe rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc bydisc, into the till.--Thank you, sir. Another time.A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew hisgaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.--Good morning, he said, moving away.--Good morning, sir.No sign. Gone. What matter?He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. AgendathNetaim: planters company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkishgovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel andconstruction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. Youpay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificialirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name enteredfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and thebalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse , Berlin, W. .Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowderedolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars,eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows thetaste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too.Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevins parade. And Mastiansky withthe old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citronsbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it tothe nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moiseltold me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must bewithout a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chapticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soileddungarees. Theres whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesnt see. Chapyou know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegiancaptains. Wonder if Ill meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke therain. On earth as it is in heaven.A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the deadsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift thosewaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called itraining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All deadnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore theoldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidys, clutching anaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over allthe earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being borneverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an oldwomans: the grey sunken cunt of the world.Desolation.Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket heturned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along hisveins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I amhere now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong sideof the bed. Must begin again those Sandows exercises. On the hands down.Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell thegentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her amplebedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, inslim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, agirl with gold hair on the wind.Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gatheredthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.Mrs Marion.--Poldy!Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked throughwarm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.--Who are the letters for?He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.--A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And aletter for you.He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve ofher knees.--Do you want the blind up?Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw herglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.--That do? he asked, turning.She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.--She got the things, she said.He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself backslowly with a snug sigh.--Hurry up with that tea, she said. Im parched.--The kettle is boiling, he said.But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiledlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:--Poldy!--What?--Scald the teapot.On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. Hescalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea,tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw hetook off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watchedthe lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the catmewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she wont mouse. Saythey wont eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall toher and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. Hesprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: BlazesBoylans seaside girls.The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crownDerby, smiling. Silly Millys birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces offolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.    O, MILLY BLOOM, YOU ARE MY DARLING.    YOU ARE MY LOOKINGGLASS FROM NIGHT TO MORNING.    ID RATHER HAVE YOU WITHOUT A FARTHING    THAN KATEY KEOGH WITH HER ASS AND GARDEN.Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was acourteous old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off theplatform. And the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly broughtit into the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwins hat! Allwe laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted theteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried itupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set iton the chair by the bedhead.--What a time you were! she said.She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow onthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large softbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder. The warmth ofher couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the teashe poured.A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In theact of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.--Who was the letter from? he asked.Bold hand. Marion.--O, Boylan, she said. Hes bringing the programme.--What are you singing?--LA CI DAREM with J. C. Doyle, she said, and LOVES OLD SWEET SONG.Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leavesnext day. Like foul flowerwater.--Would you like the window open a little?She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:--What time is the funeral?--Eleven, I think, he answered. I didnt see the paper.Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soileddrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round astocking: rumpled, shiny sole.--No: that book.Other stocking. Her petticoat.--It must have fell down, she said.He felt here and there. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. Wonder if she pronouncesthat right: VOGLIO. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped andlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of theorangekeyed chamberpot.--Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. Theres a word I wanted to askyou.She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search thetext with the hairpin till she reached the word.--Met him what? he asked.--Here, she said. What does that mean?He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.--Metempsychosis?--Yes. Whos he when hes at home?--Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. Its Greek: from the Greek. Thatmeans the transmigration of souls.--O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same youngeyes. The first night after the charades. Dolphins Barn. He turned overthe smudged pages. RUBY: THE PRIDE OF THE RING. Hello. Illustration.Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floornaked. Sheet kindly lent. THE MONSTER MAFFEI DESISTED AND FLUNG HISVICTIM FROM HIM WITH AN OATH. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals.Trapeze at Henglers. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping.

Dignams soul ...--Did you finish it? he asked.--Yes, she said. Theres nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with thefirst fellow all the time?--Never read it. Do you want another?--Yes. Get another of Paul de Kocks. Nice name he has.She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.Must get that Capel street library book renewed or theyll write toKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: thats the word.--Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another bodyafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we alllived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Betteremind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. Anexample?The BATH OF THE NYMPH over the bed. Given away with the Easternumber of PHOTO BITS: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before youput milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six Igave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Nakednymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.He turned the pages back.--Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. Theyused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, forinstance. What they called nymphs, for example.Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,inhaling through her arched nostrils.--Theres a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?--The kidney! he cried suddenly.He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toesagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, steppinghastily down the stairs with a flurried storks legs. Pungent smoke shotup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the forkunder the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only alittle burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scantybrown gravy trickle over it.Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. Heshore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkfulinto his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Doneto a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped onein the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some youngstudent and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading itslowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raisingit to his mouth.    Dearest PapliThanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits mesplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummysIovely box of creams and am writing.

Not much. Still, she might doworse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler teato wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing hashappened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild pieceof goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now.Vain: very.He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day Icaught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.

Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has thefidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with herback to the fire too.He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,undoing the waistband of his trousers.

Hope no ape comes knocking justas Im.In the tabledrawer he found an old number of TITBITS. He folded itunder his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in softbounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.Listening, he heard her voice:--Come, come, pussy. Come.He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listentowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.The maid was in the garden.

Enthusiast.He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to getthese trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head underthe low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewashand stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peeredthrough a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in hiscountinghouse. Nobody.Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pagesover on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep ita bit.

About a million barrels all the same.An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. Thebungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl ofliquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.

Like to see them sittinground in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap itup like milk, I suppose.The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet placeto be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slowmusic. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in thebenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch kneltat the altarrails.

He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook adrop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then thenext one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into hermouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes andopen your mouth. What? CORPUS: body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin.Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They dont seem to chew it:only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibalscotton to it.He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one byone, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself inits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. Weought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here andthere, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it tomelt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: its that sort ofbread: unleavened shewbread.

Wake this time next year.He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneelan instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the laceaffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldnt know what todo to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered,it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn upwith a veil and black bag.

By the way, did I tear up that envelope?Yes: under the bridge.The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregssmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drankwhat they are used to Guinnesss porter or some temperance beverageWheatleys Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochranes ginger ale(aromatic). Doesnt give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Coldcomfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise theyd have one old booserworse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the wholeatmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to makethat instrument talk, the VIBRATO: fifty pounds a year they say he had inGardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the STABAT MATER ofRossini. Father Bernard Vaughans sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ,but dont keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped.Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:QUIS EST HOMO.Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven lastwords. Mozarts twelfth mass: GLORIA in that. Those old popes keen onmusic, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina forexample too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too,chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. GreenChartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bitthick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their ownstrong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldnt feel anything after.Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, dont they? Gluttons, tall,long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face aboutand bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloomglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand upat the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and hesat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar,holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each otherin Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:--O God, our refuge and our strength ...Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throwthem the bone. I remember slightly.

Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or thephlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Cleverof nature.--About a fortnight ago, sir?--Yes, Mr Bloom said.He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, thedusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling youraches and pains.--Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and thenorangeflower water ...It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.--And white wax also, he said.Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up toher eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in mycuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for theteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.Skinfood. One of the old queens sons, duke of Albany was it? had only oneskin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make itworse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? PEAU DESPAGNE.That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Purecurd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage.Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also Ithink I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water.Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh thenall the day. Funeral be rather glum.--Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought abottle?--No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. Ill call later in the day andIll take one of these soaps. How much are they?--Fourpence, sir.Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.--Ill take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.--Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when youcome back.--Good, Mr Bloom said.He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit,the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.At his armpit Bantam Lyons voice and hand said:--Hello, Bloom. Whats the best news? Is that todays? Show us a minute.Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. Tolook younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.Bantam Lyonss yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wantsa wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pearssoap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.--I want to see about that French horse thats running today, BantamLyons said. Where the bugger is it?He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.Barbers itch. Tight collar hell lose his hair. Better leave him thepaper and get shut of him.--You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.--Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximumthe second.--I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.--Whats that? his sharp voice said.--I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it awaythat moment.Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspreadsheets back on Mr Blooms arms.--Ill risk it, he said. Here, thanks.He sped off towards Conways corner. God speed scut.Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged thesoap in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed ofit lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for largetender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Flemingembezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. Theynever come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind youof a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. Heeyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubledup like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like awheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.Something to catch the eye.Theres Hornblower standing at the porters lodge. Keep him onhands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, MrHornblower? How do you do, sir?Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They cant play it here.Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildarestreet club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line.And the skulls we were acracking when MCarthy took the floor.Heatwave. Wont last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in thestream of life we trace is dearer than them all.Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentletepid stream. This is my body.He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb ofwarmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk andlimbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bushfloating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands,a languid floating flower.    * * * * * * *Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creakingcarriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in afterhim, curving his height with care.--Come on, Simon.--After you, Mr Bloom said.Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:Yes, yes.--Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door toafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an armthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow atthe lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passedover. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us gowe give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger incorners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear hed wake. Then getting itready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it moreto your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead.Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bitin an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I amsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shiftit out of that. Wait for an opportunity.All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: thennearer: then horses hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creakingand swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blindsof the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.At walking pace.They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and werepassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheelsrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shookrattling in the doorframes.--What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.--Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.--Thats a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted bypassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smootherroad past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad inmourning, a wide hat.--Theres a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.--Who is that?--Your son and heir.--Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippeduproadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and,swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:--Was that Mulligan cad with him? His FIDUS ACHATES!--No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.--Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Gouldingfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papas little lump ofdung, the wise child that knows her own father.Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: thebottleworks: Dodder bridge.Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward hecalls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was.Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, thelandladys two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironinghis back. Thinks hell cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.About six hundred per cent profit.--Hes in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is acontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinksall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother Ill makeit my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or hisaunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. Illtickle his catastrophe, believe you me.He cried above the clatter of the wheels:--I wont have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumpersson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul MSwineys. Not likely.He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Powersmild face and Martin Cunninghams eyes and beard, gravely shaking.Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something tohand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in thehouse. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes.Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been thatmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogsat it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up.She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us atouch, Poldy. God, Im dying for it. How life begins.Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son insideher. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.Learn German too.--Are we late? Mr Power asked.--Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumpingJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, shes a dear girl. Soonbe a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a womantoo. Life, life.The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.--Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.--He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadnt that squint troubling him. Doyou follow me?He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush awaycrustcrumbs from under his thighs.--What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?--Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Powersaid.All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewedbuttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowneddownward and said:--Unless Im greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?--It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feetquite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.--After all, he said, its the most natural thing in the world.--Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peakof his beard gently.--Yes, Mr Bloom answered. Hes behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.--And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.--At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.--I met MCoy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said hed try to come.The carriage halted short.--Whats wrong?--Were stopped.--Where are we?Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.--The grand canal, he said.Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly nevergot it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles.Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Dontmiss this chance. Dogs home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. Adying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old mens dogsusually are.A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant ofshower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through acolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.--The weather is changing, he said quietly.--A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.--Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. Theres the sun again coming out.Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun,hurled a mute curse at the sky.--Its as uncertain as a childs bottom, he said.--Were off again.The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayedgently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.--Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard takinghim off to his face.--O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,Simon, on Ben Dollards singing of THE CROPPY BOY.--Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. HIS SINGING OF THAT SIMPLEBALLAD, MARTIN, IS THE MOST TRENCHANT RENDERING I EVER HEARD IN THE WHOLECOURSE OF MY EXPERIENCE.--Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. Hes dead nuts on that. And theretrospective arrangement.--Did you read Dan Dawsons speech? Martin Cunningham asked.--I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?--In the paper this morning.Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I mustchange for her.--No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.Mr Blooms glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning thedeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, whatPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleynes? no, Sexton,Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief ofhis. Aged  after a long and tedious illness. Months mind: Quinlan.On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.    IT IS NOW A MONTH SINCE DEAR HENRY FLED    TO HIS HOME UP ABOVE IN THE SKY    WHILE HIS FAMILY WEEPS AND MOURNS HIS LOSS    HOPING SOME DAY TO MEET HIM ON HIGH.I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it inthe bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled.Before my patience are exhausted.National school. Meades yard. The hazard. Only two there now.Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trottinground with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raisedtheir hats.A pointsmans back straightened itself upright suddenly against atramway standard by Mr Blooms window. Couldnt they invent somethingautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellowwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a jobmaking the new invention?Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with acrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in lawperhaps.They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Marks, under the railwaybridge, past the Queens theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton,Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I.Or the LILY OF KILLARNEY? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerfulchange. Wet bright bills for next week. FUN ON THE BRISTOL. MartinCunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink ortwo. As broad as its long.Hes coming in the afternoon. Her songs.Plastos. Sir Philip Cramptons memorial fountain bust. Who was he?--How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his browin salute.--He doesnt see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?--Who? Mr Dedalus asked.--Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.Just that moment I was thinking.Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank thewhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his righthand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimesfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am justlooking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bitsofty. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I supposethe skin cant contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But theshape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night ofthe dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacantglance over their faces.Mr Power asked:--How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?--O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. Its a goodidea, you see ...--Are you going yourself?--Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to thecounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour thechief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.--Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.Have you good artists?--Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, well have alltopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, infact.--And MADAME, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness andclasped them. Smith OBrien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriagewheeling by Farrells statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, hismouth opening: oot.--Four bootlaces for a penny.Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Humestreet. Same house as Mollys namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor forWaterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourningtoo. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.OCallaghan on his last legs.And MADAME. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.Doing her hair, humming. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. No. VORREI E NON. Lookingat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. MI TREMA UN POCO IL.Beautiful on that TRE her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.There is a word throstle that expresses that.His eyes passed lightly over Mr Powers goodlooking face. Greyishover the ears. MADAME: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about thewoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it toldme, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out prettyquick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound ofrumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jurys. Or the Moira, was it?They passed under the hugecloaked Liberators form.Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.--Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the cornerof Elverys Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.--In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:--The devil break the hasp of your back!Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window asthe carriage passed Grays statue.--We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.His eyes met Mr Blooms eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:--Well, nearly all of us.Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces.--Thats an awfully good one thats going the rounds about Reuben J andthe son.--About the boatman? Mr Power asked.--Yes. Isnt it awfully good?--What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didnt hear it.--There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to sendhim to the Isle of Man out of harms way but when they were both ...--What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?--Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he triedto drown ...--Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.--No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself ...Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:--Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on theirway to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose andover the wall with him into the Liffey.--For Gods sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?--Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole andfished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to thefather on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.--Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is ...--And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin forsaving his sons life.A stifled sigh came from under Mr Powers hand.--O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.--Isnt it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.--One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.Mr Powers choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.Nelsons pillar.--Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!--We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Dedalus sighed.--Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldnt grudge us a laugh.Many a good one he told himself.--The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with hisfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last andhe was in his usual health that Id be driving after him like this. Hesgone from us.--As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He wentvery suddenly.--Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.He tapped his chest sadly.Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a rednose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spentcolouring it.Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.--He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.--The best death, Mr Bloom said.Their wide open eyes looked at him.--No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.No-one spoke.Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,temperance hotel, Falconers railway guide, civil service college, Gills,catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. Atnight too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late FatherMathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotundacorner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. Amourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors.Dun for a nun.--Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.A dwarfs face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudys was. Dwarfsbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly societypays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby.Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If its healthy its from the mother.If not from the man. Better luck next time.--Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. Its well out of it.The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattlehis bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.--In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.--But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.--The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.--Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. Wemust take a charitable view of it.--They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.--It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunninghamslarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.Like Shakespeares face. Always a good word to say. They have nomercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. Theyused to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if itwasnt broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in theriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of awife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning thefurniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of thedamned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh.Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that nightDedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering withMartins umbrella.    AND THEY CALL ME THE JEWEL OF ASIA,    OF ASIA,    THE GEISHA.He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. Theroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight throughthe slats of the Venetian blind. The coroners sunlit ears, big and hairy.Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellowstreaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict:overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.--We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.--God grant he doesnt upset us on the road, Mr Power said.--I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrowin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.--Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sentover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybodyhere seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from SAUL. Hes as badas old Antonio.  He left me on my ownio.  Pirouette!  The MATERMISERICORDIAE. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward forincurables there. Very encouraging. Our Ladys Hospice for the dying.Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They lookterrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with thespoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young studentthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. Hes gone over to the lying-inhospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriagegalloped round a corner: stopped.--Whats wrong now?A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing,slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clottedbony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleatingtheir fear.--Emigrants, Mr Power said.--Huuuh! the drovers voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.Huuuh! out of that!Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe soldthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef forold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarterlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in ayear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off thetrain at Clonsilla.The carriage moved on through the drove.--I cant make out why the corporation doesnt run a tramline from theparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken intrucks down to the boats.--Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quiteright. They ought to.--Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to havemunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the lineout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage andall. Dont you see what I mean?--O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloondiningroom.--A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.--Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldnt it be moredecent than galloping two abreast?--Well, theres something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.--And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldnt have scenes like that whenthe hearse capsized round Dunphys and upset the coffin on to the road.--That was terrible, Mr Powers shocked face said, and the corpse fellabout the road. Terrible!--First round Dunphys, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.--Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. PaddyDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit toolarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking whats upnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insidesdecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.--Dunphys, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.Dunphys corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect well pull uphere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.Elixir of life.But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him inthe knocking about? He would and he wouldnt, I suppose. Depends onwhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. Itwould be better to bury them in red: a dark red.In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearsetrotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on hisdropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock aslacktethered horse. Aboard of the BUGABU.Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floatedon his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds ofreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycledown. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at theauction but a ladys. Developing waterways. James MCanns hobby to rowme oer the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Campingout. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing.Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock toDublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown strawhat, saluting Paddy Dignam.They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.--I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.--Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.--How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?--Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.The carriage steered left for Finglas road.The stonecutters yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit ofland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder andsculptor.Passed.On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sextons, an old tramp sat,grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrownyawning boot. After lifes journey.Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.Mr Power pointed.--That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.--So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.Murdered his brother. Or so they said.--The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.--Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. Thats the maxim ofthe law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocentperson to be wrongfully condemned.They looked. Murderers ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfullycondemned. Murder. The murderers image in the eye of the murdered.They love reading about it. Mans head found in a garden. Her clothingconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.Murder will out.Cramped in this carriage. She mightnt like me to come that waywithout letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them oncewith their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid thetrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vaingestures on the air.The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. MartinCunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved thedoor open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalusfollowed.Change that soap now. Mr Blooms hand unbuttoned his hip pocketswiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchiefpocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his otherhand still held.Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. Its all the same.Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits.Who ate them? Mourners coming out.He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed,Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse andtook out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.Where is that childs funeral disappeared to?A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay agranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at itwith his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing ona bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here everyday? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome forthe protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour.Too many in the world.Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawedharpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girls face stained withdirt and tears, holding the womans arm, looking up at her for a sign tocry. Fishs face, bloodless and livid.The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. Somuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First thestiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followedwith their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.All walked after.Martin Cunningham whispered:--I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.--What? Mr Power whispered. How so?--His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had theQueens hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.Anniversary.--O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyesfollowed towards the cardinals mausoleum. Speaking.--Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.--I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.--How many children did he leave?--Five. Ned Lambert says hell try to get one of the girls into Todds.--A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.--A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.--Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.Has the laugh at him now.He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She hadoutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One mustoutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in theworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope youll soon followhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet whoknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn ona guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But inthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts.All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance.Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. Itnever comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no morein her warm bed.--How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haventseen you for a month of Sundays.--Never better. How are all in Corks own town?--I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, NedLambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.--And how is Dick, the solid man?--Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.--By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?--Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till theinsurance is cleared up.--Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?--Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wifes brother. John Henry Menton isbehind. He put down his name for a quid.--Ill engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he oughtto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.--How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?--Many a good mans fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stoodbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair andat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was hethere when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last momentand recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe threeshillings to OGrady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin intothe chapel. Which end is his head?After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screenedlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellowcandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying awreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mournersknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the fontand, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from hispocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently onhis left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out througha door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with onehand, balancing with the other a little book against his toads belly.Wholl read the book? I, said the rook.They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his bookwith a fluent croak.Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. DOMINE-NAMINE.Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woebetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burstsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on himlike a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burstsideways.--NON INTRES IN JUDICIUM CUM SERVO TUO, DOMINE.Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiemmass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning inthe gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toadtoo. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air ofthe place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of badgas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburghslovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffinssometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. Onewhiff of that and youre a goner.My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. Thats better.The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boysbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end andshook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As youwere before you rested. Its all written down: he has to do it.--ET NE NOS INDUCAS IN TENTATIONEM.The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would bebetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, ofcourse ...Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fedup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day afresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead inchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girlswith little sparrows breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thingover them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.--IN PARADISUM.Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoistedthe coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. CornyKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. Allfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom camelast folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at theground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheelsground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt bootsfollowed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustnt lilt here.--The OConnell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.Mr Powers soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.--Hes at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O. But hisheart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!--Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. Ill soon be stretchedbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a littlein his walk. Mr Power took his arm.--Shes better where she is, he said kindly.--I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is inheaven if there is a heaven.Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners toplod by.--Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.--The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we cando so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.They covered their heads.--The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, dont you think?Mr Kernan said with reproof.Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secreteyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We arethe last. In the same boat. Hope hell say something else.Mr Kernan added:--The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, moreimpressive I must say.Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.Mr Kernan said with solemnity:--I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. That touches a mans inmost heart.--It does, Mr Bloom said.Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by twowith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of bloodevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots ofthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn thething else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead.That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth,Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then everyfellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of histraps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder ina skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.--Everything went off A, he said. What?He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policemans shoulders. Withyour tooraloom tooraloom.--As it should be, Mr Kernan said.--What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.Mr Kernan assured him.--Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. Iknow his face.Ned Lambert glanced back.--Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, thesoprano. Shes his wife.--O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I havent seen her for some time.he was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeengolden years ago, at Mat Dillons in Roundtown. And a good armful shewas.He looked behind through the others.--What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasnt he in the stationery line?I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.Ned Lambert smiled.--Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Helys. A traveller for blottingpaper.--In Gods name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon likethat for? She had plenty of game in her then.--Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.John Henry Mentons large eyes stared ahead.The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed amongthe grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched theircaps.--John OConnell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.Mr OConnell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:--I am come to pay you another visit.--My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I dont want yourcustom at all.Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at MartinCunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back.--Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?--I did not, Martin Cunningham said.They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. Thecaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke ina discreet tone to their vacant smiles.--They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggyevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked forMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsingabout in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks speltout the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statueof Our Saviour the widow had got put up.The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. Heresumed:--And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, NOT A BLOODY BIT LIKE THEMAN, SAYS HE. THATS NOT MULCAHY, says he, WHOEVER DONE IT.Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, acceptingthe dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.--Thats all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.--I know, Hynes said. I know that.--To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. Its pure goodheartedness:damn the thing else.Mr Bloom admired the caretakers prosperous bulk. All want to be ongood terms with him. Decent fellow, John OConnell, real good sort. Keys:like Keyess ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. HABEASCORPUS. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I writeBallsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writingto Martha? Hope its not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the betterof a shave. Grey sprouting beard. Thats the first sign when the hairscome out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey.Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It mightthrill her first. Courting death ... Shades of night hovering here withall the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyardsyawn and Daniel OConnell must be a descendant I suppose who is this usedto say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a biggiant in the dark. Will o the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mindoff it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her aghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, Ihave. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.Still theyd kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkishgraveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a youngwidow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice ofpleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet.Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to thestarving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting todo it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him fieldafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sittingor kneeling you couldnt. Standing? His head might come up some day aboveground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the groundmust be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass andedgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is.Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppiesgrowing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardensare just over there. Its the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every manhis price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluablefor fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditorand accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.With thanks.I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rotquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowykind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out ofthem. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they arego on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feedon feed on themselves.But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simplyswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty littleseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense ofpower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about thebulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven  a.m. this morning.  p.m.(closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the menanyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know whats infashion. A juicy pear or ladies punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep outthe damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggersin HAMLET. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Darent jokeabout the dead for two years at least. DE MORTUIS NIL NISI PRIUS. Go outof mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke.Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you secondwind. New lease of life.--How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.--Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased totrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, steppingwith care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set itsnose on the brink, looping the bands round it.Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June.He doesnt know who is here nor care.Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?Now who is he Id like to know? Now Id give a trifle to know who he is.Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on hislonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still hed have to get someone tosod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Onlyman buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. SayRobinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. EveryFriday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.    O, POOR ROBINSON CRUSOE!    HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO SO?Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think ofthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They couldinvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellows. Theyre soparticular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land.Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see whatit means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. TheIrishmans house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the sameidea.Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the baredheads. Twelve. Im thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.Deaths number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasnt in thechapel, that Ill swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I hadone like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he wasonce. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit ofmine turned by Mesias. Hello. Its dyed. His wife I forgot hes notmarried or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on thegravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.Pause.If we were all suddenly somebody else.Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one,they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper.The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietlyin the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindlycaretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which willgo next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. Its the moment you feel.Must be damned unpleasant. Cant believe it at first. Mistake must be:someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I havent yet.Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Wouldyou like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all youhid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press hislower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are thesoles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on thefloor since hes doomed. Devil in that picture of sinners death showinghim a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of LUCIA.SHALL I NEVERMORE BEHOLD THEE? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. Peopletalk about you a bit: forget you. Dont forget to pray for him.Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Thenthey follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping youre welland not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into thefire of purgatory.Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you dowhen you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboys warning.Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,poor mamma, and little Rudy.The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clayin on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive allthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, ofcourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to havesome law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock ora telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag ofdistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as wellto get shut of them as soon as you are sure theres no.The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Hadenough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, coveringthemselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portlyfigure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure ofhis ground, he traversed the dismal fields.Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But heknows them all. No: coming to me.--I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is yourchristian name? Im not sure.--L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down MCoys name too.He asked me to.--Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the FREEMAN once.So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine theyknow. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a fewads. Charley, youre my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well,does no harm. I saw to that, MCoy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged.Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.--And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow wasover there in the ...He looked around.--Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?--MIntosh, Hynes said scribbling. I dont know who he is. Is thathis name?He moved away, looking about him.--No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!Didnt hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well ofall the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. GoodLord, what became of him?A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.--O, excuse me!He stepped aside nimbly.Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested theirspades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreathagainst a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers puton their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Thenknocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from thehaft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on withshouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the graveheadanother coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turningaway, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir:trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths,staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.--Let us go round by the chiefs grave, Hynes said. We have time.--Let us, Mr Power said.They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe MrPowers blank voice spoke:--Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filledwith stones. That one day he will come again.Hynes shook his head.--Parnell will never come again, he said. Hes there, all that was mortalof him. Peace to his ashes.Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels,crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcasteyes, old Irelands hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money onsome charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Doesanybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot.Then lump them together to save time. All souls day. Twentyseventh Illbe at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free ofweeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Neardeaths door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did itof their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket.More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright.I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or awomans with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a countrychurchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or ThomasCampbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murrens.The great physician called him home. Well its Gods acre for them.Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot tohave a quiet smoke and read the CHURCH TIMES. Marriage ads they nevertry to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical.The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing.Immortelles.A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like thewedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, adaisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to besideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland wasdedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why thisinfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket offruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.Apollo that was.How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.As you are now so once were we.Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well,the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep itin the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagainhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photographreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldnt remember the face afterfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that diedwhen I was in Wisdom Helys.Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait.There he goes.An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving thepebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The greyalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.Good hidingplace for treasure.Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. RobertEmmet was buried here by torchlight, wasnt he? Making his rounds.Tail gone now.One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick thebones clean no matter who it was.

Or bury at sea.Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water.Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. Butbeing brought back to life no. Cant bury in the air however. Out of aflying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is letdown. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldnt besurprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before hes well dead.Got wind of Dignam. They wouldnt care about the smell of it. Saltwhitecrumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I washere was Mrs Sinicos funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. Andeven scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I readof to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with runninggravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you afterdeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you afterdeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like thatother world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. Theyare not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.Mat Dillons long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag outthat evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure flukeof mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at firstsight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.--Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.They stopped.--Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.--There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton tookoff his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on hiscoatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.--Its all right now, Martin Cunningham said.John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.--Thank you, he said shortly.They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drewbehind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law.Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, withouthis seeing it.Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.Get the pull over him that way.Thank you. How grand we are this morning!    * * * * * * *    IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLISBefore Nelsons pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, startedfor Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harolds Cross. The hoarse DublinUnited Tramway Companys timekeeper bawled them off:--Rathgar and Terenure!--Come on, Sandymount Green!Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and asingledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glidedparallel.--Start, Palmerston Park!    THE WEARER OF THE CROWNUnder the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called andpolished. Parked in North Princes street His Majestys vermilionmailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESSGrossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Princesstores and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery floatbumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out ofPrinces stores.--There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.--Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and Ill take it round to theTELEGRAPH office.The door of Ruttledges office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minutein a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed outwith a roll of papers under his cape, a kings courier.Red Murrays long shears sliced out the advertisement from thenewspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.--Ill go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.--Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behindhis ear, we can do him one.--Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. Ill rub that in.We.    WILLIAM BRAYDEN,    ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNTRed Murray touched Mr Blooms arm with the shears and whispered:--Brayden.Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as astately figure entered between the newsboards of the WEEKLY FREEMAN ANDNATIONAL PRESS and the FREEMANS JOURNAL AND NATIONAL PRESS. DullthuddingGuinnesss barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by anumbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back ascended eachstep: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalussays. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat,neck.--Dont you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.The door of Ruttledges office whispered: ee: cree. They always buildone door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary,Martha. Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.--Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.--Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of OurSaviour.Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on hisheart. In MARTHA.    CO-OME THOU LOST ONE,    CO-OME THOU DEAR ONE!    THE CROZIER AND THE PEN--His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counterand stepped off posthaste with a word:--FREEMAN!Mr Bloom said slowly:--Well, he is one of our saviours also.A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as hepassed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,along the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?Thumping. Thumping.He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewnpacking paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towardsNannettis reading closet.    WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION    OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESSHynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump.This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines.Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. Hismachineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.    HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUTMr Bloom halted behind the foremans spare body, admiring a glossy crown.Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Memberfor College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it wasworth. Its the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news inthe official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in theyear one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis,barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant tostatute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported fromBallina. Nature notes. Cartoons.

The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures.Shapely bathers on golden strand. Worlds biggest balloon. Double marriageof sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other.Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump.Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them theydclank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.--Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of thesheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently overthe dirty glass screen.--Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.Mr Bloom stood in his way.--If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,pointing backward with his thumb.--Did you? Hynes asked.--Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and youll catch him.--Thanks, old man, Hynes said. Ill tap him too.He hurried on eagerly towards the FREEMANS JOURNAL.Three bob I lent him in Meaghers. Three weeks. Third hint.    WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORKMr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannettis desk.--Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.--He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.The foreman moved his pencil towards it.--But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wantstwo keys at the top.Hell of a racket they make. He doesnt hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.Maybe he understands what I.The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow,began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.--Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.Let him take that in first.Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw theforemans sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond theobedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles ofit unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: varioususes, thousand and one things.Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drewswiftly on the scarred woodwork.    HOUSE OF KEY(E)S--Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.Better not teach him his own business.--You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the topin leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think thats a good idea?The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratchedthere quietly.--The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from theisle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. Butthen if he didnt know only make it awkward for him. Better not.--We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?--I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a housethere too. Ill just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just alittle par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensedpremises. Longfelt want. So on.The foreman thought for an instant.--We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months renewal.A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check itsilently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watchingthe silent typesetters at their cases.    ORTHOGRAPHICALWant to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunninghamforgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing toview the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of aharassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pearunder a cemetery wall. Silly, isnt it? Cemetery put in of course onaccount of the symmetry.I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I oughtto have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could havesaid. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward itsflyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almosthuman the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in itsown way. Sllt.    NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTORThe foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:--Wait. Wheres the archbishops letter? Its to be repeated in theTELEGRAPH. Wheres whats his name?He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.--Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.--Ay. Wheres Monks?--Monks!Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.--Then Ill get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and youll give it agood place I know.--Monks!--Yes, sir.Three months renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Tryit anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge.Tourists over for the show.    A DAYFATHERHe walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he musthave put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ads,speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now.Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank Id say. Wife a good cookand washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, nodamn nonsense.    AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVERHe stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practicethat. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, readingbackwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, Odear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land ofEgypt and into the house of bondage ALLELUIA. SHEMA ISRAEL ADONAI ELOHENU.No, thats the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacobs sons. And then thelamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and thedog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.Justice it means but its everybody eating everyone else. Thats what lifeis after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seemsto see with his fingers.Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery onto the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catchhim out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citronshouse. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.    ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAPHe went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all overthose walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasysmell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thoms next doorwhen I was there.He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, thesoap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back hishandkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into thehip pocket of his trousers.What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram:something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.A sudden screech of laughter came from the EVENING TELEGRAPH office. Knowwho that is. Whats up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.He entered softly.    ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA--The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully tothe dusty windowpane.Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambertsquizzing face, asked of it sourly:--Agonising Christ, wouldnt it give you a heartburn on your arse?Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:--OR AGAIN, NOTE THE MEANDERINGS OF SOME PURLING RILL AS IT BABBLES ONITS WAY, THO QUARRELLING WITH THE STONY OBSTACLES, TO THE TUMBLING WATERSOF NEPTUNES BLUE DOMAIN, MID MOSSY BANKS, FANNED BY GENTLEST ZEPHYRS,PLAYED ON BY THE GLORIOUS SUNLIGHT OR NEATH THE SHADOWS CAST OER ITSPENSIVE BOSOM BY THE OVERARCHING LEAFAGE OF THE GIANTS OF THE FOREST. Whatabout that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. Hows thatfor high?--Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:--THE PENSIVE BOSOM AND THE OVERARSING LEAFAGE. O boys! O boys!--And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking againon the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.--That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I dont want tohear any more of the stuff.He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off Isee. Rather upsets a mans day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or hisgreatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death writtenthis long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself.Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges EyreChatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days.Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.--Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.--What is it? Mr Bloom asked.--A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answeredwith pomp of tone. OUR LOVELY LAND.    SHORT BUT TO THE POINT--Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.--Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With anaccent on the whose.--Dan Dawsons land Mr Dedalus said.--Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.Ned Lambert nodded.--But listen to this, he said.The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door waspushed in.--Excuse me, J. J. OMolloy said, entering.Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.--I beg yours, he said.--Good day, Jack.--Come in. Come in.--Good day.--How are you, Dedalus?--Well. And yourself?J. J. OMolloy shook his head.    SADCleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. Whats inthe wind, I wonder. Money worry.--OR AGAIN IF WE BUT CLIMB THE SERRIED MOUNTAIN PEAKS.--Youre looking extra.--Is the editor to be seen? J. J. OMolloy asked, looking towards theinner door.--Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. Hes inhis sanctum with Lenehan.J. J. OMolloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back thepink pages of the file.Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debtsof honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. andT. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleevelike the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for theEXPRESS with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began onthe INDEPENDENT. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about whenthey get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the samebreath. Wouldnt know which to believe. One story good till you hear thenext. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.Hail fellow well met the next moment.--Ah, listen to this for God sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. OR AGAIN IF WEBUT CLIMB THE SERRIED MOUNTAIN PEAKS ...--Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflatedwindbag!--Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, TOWERING HIGH ON HIGH, TO BATHE OUR SOULS,AS IT WERE ...--Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is hetaking anything for it?--AS TWERE, IN THE PEERLESS PANORAMA OF IRELANDS PORTFOLIO, UNMATCHED,DESPITE THEIR WELLPRAISED PROTOTYPES IN OTHER VAUNTED PRIZE REGIONS, FORVERY BEAUTY, OF BOSKY GROVE AND UNDULATING PLAIN AND LUSCIOUS PASTURELANDOF VERNAL GREEN, STEEPED IN THE TRANSCENDENT TRANSLUCENT GLOW OF OUR MILDMYSTERIOUS IRISH TWILIGHT ...    HIS NATIVE DORIC--The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.--THAT MANTLES THE VISTA FAR AND WIDE AND WAIT TILL THE GLOWING ORB OFTHE MOON SHINE FORTH TO IRRADIATE HER SILVER EFFULGENCE ...--O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions!Thatll do, Ned. Life is too short.He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushymoustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. Aninstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHughsunshaven blackspectacled face.--Doughy Daw! he cried.    WHAT WETHERUP SAIDAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hotcake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasnt he? Why they callhim Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to thatchap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Geta grip of them by the stomach.The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face,crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyesstared about them and the harsh voice asked:--What is it?--And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.--Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.--Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drinkafter that.--Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.--Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editors blue eyes rovedtowards Mr Blooms face, shadowed by a smile.--Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.    MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED--North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. Wewon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!--Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance athis toecaps.--In Ohio! the editor shouted.--So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.Passing out he whispered to J. J. OMolloy:--Incipient jigs. Sad case.--Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.My Ohio!--A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.    O, HARP EOLIAN!He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breakingoff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonantunwashed teeth.--Bingbang, bangbang.Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.--Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.He went in.--What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, comingto the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.--Thatll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.Hello, Jack. Thats all right.--Good day, Myles, J. J. OMolloy said, letting the pages he held sliplimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?The telephone whirred inside.--Twentyeight ... No, twenty ... Double four ... Yes.    SPOT THE WINNERLenehan came out of the inner office with SPORTS tissues.--Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.Madden up.He tossed the tissues on to the table.Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the doorwas flung open.--Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringingurchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down thesteps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the airblue scrawls and under the table came to earth.--It wasnt me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.--Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. Theres a hurricaneblowing.Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as hestooped twice.--Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was PatFarrell shoved me, sir.He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.--Him, sir.--Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.J. J. OMolloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:--Continued on page six, column four.--Yes, EVENING TELEGRAPH here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Isthe boss ...? Yes, TELEGRAPH ... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms ?...Aha! I see ... Right. Ill catch him.    A COLLISION ENSUESThe bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly andbumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.--PARDON, MONSIEUR, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and makinga grimace.--My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? Im in ahurry.--Knee, Lenehan said.He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:--The accumulation of the ANNO DOMINI.--Sorry, Mr Bloom said.He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. OMolloyslapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, amouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on thedoorsteps:  --WE ARE THE BOYS OF WEXFORD    WHO FOUGHT WITH HEART AND HAND.    EXIT BLOOM--Im just running round to Bachelors walk, Mr Bloom said, about this adof Keyess. Want to fix it up. They tell me hes round there in Dillons.He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.--Begone! he said. The world is before you.--Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.J. J. OMolloy took the tissues from Lenehans hand and read them,blowing them apart gently, without comment.--Hell get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through hisblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps afterhim.--Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.    A STREET CORTEGEBoth smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in MrBlooms wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, atail of white bowknots.--Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, andyoull kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.Small nines. Steal upon larks.He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on slidingfeet past the fireplace to J. J. OMolloy who placed the tissues in hisreceiving hands.--Whats that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other twogone?--Who? the professor said, turning. Theyre gone round to the Oval for adrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.--Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Wheres my hat?He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air andagainst the wood as he locked his desk drawer.--Hes pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.--Seems to be, J. J. OMolloy said, taking out a cigarettecase inmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the mostmatches?    THE CALUMET OF PEACEHe offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehanpromptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.OMolloy opened his case again and offered it.--THANKY VOUS, Lenehan said, helping himself.The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:  --TWAS RANK AND FAME THAT TEMPTED THEE,    TWAS EMPIRE CHARMED THY HEART.The professor grinned, locking his long lips.--Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for himwith quick grace, said:--Silence for my brandnew riddle!--IMPERIUM ROMANUM, J. J. OMolloy said gently. It sounds nobler thanBritish or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.--Thats it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.We havent got the chance of a snowball in hell.    THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME--Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. Wemustnt be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,imperial, imperious, imperative.He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:--What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: IT IS MEET TO BEHERE. LET US BUILD AN ALTAR TO JEHOVAH. The Roman, like the Englishman whofollows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set hisfoot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazedabout him in his toga and he said: IT IS MEET TO BE HERE. LET US CONSTRUCTA WATERCLOSET.--Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,as we read in the first chapter of Guinnesss, were partial to the runningstream.--They were natures gentlemen, J. J. OMolloy murmured. But we havealso Roman law.--And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.--Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. OMolloy asked.It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was goingswimmingly ...--First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?Mr OMadden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came infrom the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.--ENTREZ, MES ENFANTS! Lenehan cried.--I escort a suppliant, Mr OMadden Burke said melodiously. Youth led byExperience visits Notoriety.--How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Yourgovernor is just gone.    ? ? ?Lenehan said to all:--Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,excogitate, reply.Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.--Who? the editor asked.Bit torn off.--Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.--That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?    ON SWIFT SAIL FLAMING    FROM STORM AND SOUTH    HE COMES, PALE VAMPIRE,    MOUTH TO MY MOUTH.--Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over theirshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned ...?Bullockbefriending bard.    SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT--Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. MrGarrett Deasy asked me to ...--O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. Thebloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouthdisease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiters facein the Star and Garter. Oho!A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife ofMenelaus, ten years the Greeks. ORourke, prince of Breffni.--Is he a widower? Stephen asked.--Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down thetypescript. Emperors horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on theramparts of Vienna. Dont you forget! Maximilian Karl ODonnell, grafvon Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrianfieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes,every time. Dont you forget that!--The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. OMolloy said quietly,turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.Professor MacHugh turned on him.--And if not? he said.--Ill tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was oneday ...    LOST CAUSES    NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED--We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for usis the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyalto the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. Ispeak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: timeis money. Material domination. DOMINUS! Lord! Where is the spirituality?Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!    KYRIE ELEISON!A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his longlips.--The Greek! he said again. KYRIOS! Shining word! The vowels the Semiteand the Saxon know not. KYRIE! The radiance of the intellect. I ought toprofess Greek, the language of the mind. KYRIE ELEISON! The closetmakerand the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liegesubjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgarand of the empire of the spirit, not an IMPERIUM, that went under with theAthenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misledby an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.Loyal to a lost cause.He strode away from them towards the window.--They went forth to battle, Mr OMadden Burke said greyly, but theyalways fell.--Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received inthe latter half of the matinee. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!He whispered then near Stephens ear:    LENEHANS LIMERICK  --THERES A PONDEROUS PUNDIT MACHUGH    WHO WEARS GOGGLES OF EBONY HUE.    AS HE MOSTLY SEES DOUBLE    TO WEAR THEM WHY TROUBLE?    I CANT SEE THE JOE MILLER. CAN YOU?In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.--Thatll be all right, he said. Ill read the rest after. Thatll be allright.Lenehan extended his hands in protest.--But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?--Opera? Mr OMadden Burkes sphinx face reriddled.Lenehan announced gladly:--THE ROSE OF CASTILE. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!He poked Mr OMadden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr OMadden Burkefell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.--Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustlingtissues.The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand acrossStephens and Mr OMadden Burkes loose ties.--Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.--Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. OMolloy said in quietmockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.    OMNIUM GATHERUM--We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.--All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics ...--The turf, Lenehan put in.--Literature, the press.--If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.--And Madam Bloom, Mr OMadden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublinsprime favourite. Lenehan gave a loud cough.--Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught acold in the park. The gate was open.    YOU CAN DO IT!The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephens shoulder.--I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite init. You can do it. I see it in your face. IN THE LEXICON OF YOUTH ...See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.--Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Greatnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public!Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul.Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes MCarthy.--We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr OMadden Burke said.Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.--He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. OMolloy said.    THE GREAT GALLAHER--You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.Wait a minute. Well paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say whenhe was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher,that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made hismark? Ill tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder inthe Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. Ill show you.He pushed past them to the files.--Look at here, he said turning. The NEW YORK WORLD cabled for a special.Remember that time?Professor MacHugh nodded.--NEW YORK WORLD, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and therest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?--Skin-the-Goat, Mr OMadden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has thatcabmans shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.You know Holohan?--Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.--And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones forthe corporation. A night watchman.Stephen turned in surprise.--Gumley? he said. You dont say so? A friend of my fathers, is it?--Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mindthe stones, see they dont run away. Look at here. What did IgnatiusGallaher do? Ill tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Haveyou WEEKLY FREEMAN of  March? Right. Have you got that?He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.--Take page four, advertisement for Bransomes coffee, let us say. Haveyou got that? Right.The telephone whirred.    A DISTANT VOICE--Ill answer it, the professor said, going.--B is parkgate. Good.His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.--T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroongate.The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cocks wattles. An illstarcheddicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into hiswaistcoat.--Hello? EVENING TELEGRAPH here ... Hello?... Whos there? ...Yes ... Yes ... Yes.--F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore,Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P. Got that?X is Davys publichouse in upper Leeson street.The professor came to the inner door.--Bloom is at the telephone, he said.--Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davys publichouse,see?    CLEVER, VERY--Clever, Lenehan said. Very.--Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloodyhistory.Nightmare from which you will never awake.--I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, thebesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, andmyself.Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:--Madam, Im Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.--History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Princes street wasthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of anadvertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the legup. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star.Now hes got in with Blumenfeld. Thats press. Thats talent. Pyatt! Hewas all their daddies!--The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and thebrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.--Hello? ... Are you there? ... Yes, hes here still. Come acrossyourself.--Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.He flung the pages down.--Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr OMadden Burke.--Very smart, Mr OMadden Burke said.Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.--Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkerswere up before the recorder--O yes, J. J. OMolloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking homethrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclonelast year and thought shed buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to bea commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!--Theyre only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like thosefellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued OHagan. Eh?Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why didyou write it then?    RHYMES AND REASONSMouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth?Must be some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressedthe same, looking the same, two by two.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .LA TUA PACE    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .CHE PARLAR TI PIACE    . . . . .MENTREM CHE IL VENTO, COME FA, SI TACE.He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, inrusset, entwining, PER LAER PERSO, in mauve, in purple, QUELLA PACIFICAORIAFIAMMA, gold of oriflamme, DI RIMIRAR FE PIU ARDENTI. But I old men,penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.--Speak up for yourself, Mr OMadden Burke said.    SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY ...J. J. OMolloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.--My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a falseconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for thethird profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away withyou. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes andEdmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Boweryguttersheet not to mention PADDY KELLYS BUDGET, PUES OCCURRENCES and ourwatchful friend THE SKIBBEREEN EAGLE. Why bring in a master of forensiceloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.    LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE--Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in hisface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established . Dr Lucas.Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!--Well, J. J. OMolloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.--Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it inhis blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.--He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, onlyfor ... But no matter.J. J. OMolloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:--One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my lifefell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.    AND IN THE PORCHES OF MINE EAR DID POUR.By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or theother story, beast with two backs?--What was that? the professor asked.    ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM--He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. OMolloy said, of Roman justiceas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the LEX TALIONIS. And he citedthe Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.--Ha.--A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!Pause. J. J. OMolloy took out his cigarettecase.False lull. Something quite ordinary.Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time thatit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.    A POLISHED PERIODJ. J. OMolloy resumed, moulding his words:--He said of it: THAT STONY EFFIGY IN FROZEN MUSIC, HORNED AND TERRIBLE,OF THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE, THAT ETERNAL SYMBOL OF WISDOM AND OF PROPHECYWHICH, IF AUGHT THAT THE IMAGINATION OR THE HAND OF SCULPTOR HAS WROUGHTIN MARBLE OF SOULTRANSFIGURED AND OF SOULTRANSFIGURING DESERVES TO LIVE,DESERVES TO LIVE.His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.--Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.--The divine afflatus, Mr OMadden Burke said.--You like it? J. J. OMolloy asked Stephen.Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.He took a cigarette from the case. J. J. OMolloy offered his case toMyles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took histrophy, saying:--Muchibus thankibus.    A MAN OF HIGH MORALE--Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. OMolloy said toStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hushpoets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was anice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewerthat you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him aboutplanes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pullingA. E.s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did hesay about me? Dont ask.--No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I everheard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historicalsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, hadspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:--You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of hisdiscourse.--He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. OMolloy said, rumour has it, onthe Trinity college estates commission.--He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a childsfrock. Go on. Well?--It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will notsay the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon thenew movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, thereforeworthless.He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised anoutspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb andringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.    IMPROMPTUIn ferial tone he addressed J. J. OMolloy:--Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he hadprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even oneshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggybeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether helooked (though he was not) a dying man.His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. OMolloys towardsStephens face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazedlinen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.Still seeking, he said:--When Fitzgibbons speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.He began:--MR CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: GREAT WAS MY ADMIRATION IN LISTENINGTO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTH OF IRELAND A MOMENT SINCE BY MYLEARNED FRIEND. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO A COUNTRYFAR AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY, INTO AN AGE REMOTE FROM THIS AGE, THAT I STOODIN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE SPEECH OF SOME HIGHPRIESTOF THAT LAND ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTHFUL MOSES.His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokesascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let ourcrooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand atit yourself?--AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD THE VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN HIGHPRIESTRAISED IN A TONE OF LIKE HAUGHTINESS AND LIKE PRIDE. I HEARD HIS WORDS ANDTHEIR MEANING WAS REVEALED TO ME.    FROM THE FATHERSIt was revealed to me that those things are good which yet arecorrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they weregood could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! Thats saint Augustine.--WHY WILL YOU JEWS NOT ACCEPT OUR CULTURE, OUR RELIGION AND OURLANGUAGE? YOU ARE A TRIBE OF NOMAD HERDSMEN: WE ARE A MIGHTY PEOPLE. YOUHAVE NO CITIES NOR NO WEALTH: OUR CITIES ARE HIVES OF HUMANITY AND OURGALLEYS, TRIREME AND  QUADRIREME, LADEN WITH ALL MANNER MERCHANDISE FURROWTHE WATERS OF THE KNOWN GLOBE. YOU HAVE BUT EMERGED FROM PRIMITIVECONDITIONS: WE HAVE A LITERATURE, A PRIESTHOOD, AN AGELONG HISTORY AND APOLITY.Nile.Child, man, effigy.By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a mansupple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.--YOU PRAY TO A LOCAL AND OBSCURE IDOL: OUR TEMPLES, MAJESTIC ANDMYSTERIOUS, ARE THE ABODES OF ISIS AND OSIRIS, OF HORUS AND AMMON RA.YOURS SERFDOM, AWE AND HUMBLENESS: OURS THUNDER AND THE SEAS. ISRAEL ISWEAK AND FEW ARE HER CHILDREN: EGYPT IS AN HOST AND TERRIBLE ARE HER ARMS. VAGRANTS AND DAYLABOURERS ARE YOU CALLED: THE WORLD TREMBLES AT OUR NAME.A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above itboldly:--BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAD THE YOUTHFUL MOSES LISTENED TO ANDACCEPTED THAT VIEW OF LIFE, HAD HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND BOWED HIS WILL ANDBOWED HIS SPIRIT BEFORE THAT ARROGANT ADMONITION HE WOULD NEVER HAVEBROUGHT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE OF BONDAGE, NOR FOLLOWED THEPILLAR OF THE CLOUD BY DAY. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ETERNALAMID LIGHTNINGS ON SINAIS MOUNTAINTOP NOR EVER HAVE COME DOWN WITH THELIGHT OF INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN HIS ARMSTHE TABLES OF THE LAW, GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OUTLAW.He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.    OMINOUS--FOR HIM!J. J. OMolloy said not without regret:--And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.--A sudden--at--the--moment--though--from--lingering--illness--often--previously--expectorated--demise, Lenehan added. And with agreat future behind him.The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway andpattering up the staircase.--That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the wind.Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches.The tribunes words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A peoplesheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all that everanywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.I have money.--Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may Isuggest that the house do now adjourn?--You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? MrOMadden Burke asked. Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.--That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favoursay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To whichparticular boosing shed? ... My casting vote is: Mooneys!He led the way, admonishing:--We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,we will not. By no manner of means.Mr OMadden Burke, following close, said with an allys lunge of hisumbrella:--Lay on, Macduff!--Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on theshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.--Foot and mouth. I know. Thatll be all right. Thatll go in. Where arethey? Thats all right.He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.    LET US HOPEJ. J. OMolloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:--I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.--Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isnt it? It hasthe prophetic vision. FUIT ILIUM! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of thisworld. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels andrushed out into the street, yelling:--Racing special!Dublin. I have much, much to learn.They turned to the left along Abbey street.--I have a vision too, Stephen said.--Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford willfollow.Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:--Racing special!    DEAR DIRTY DUBLINDubliners.--Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fiftyand fiftythree years in Fumballys lane.--Where is that? the professor asked.--Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Faceglistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.Quicker, darlint!On now. Dare it. Let there be life.--They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelsons pillar.They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. Theyshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies withthe blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven incoppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take theirumbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.--Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.    LIFE ON THE RAW--They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf atthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,proprietress ... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl atthe foot of Nelsons pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They givetwo threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddleslowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraidof the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praisingGod and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at theairslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearnshas the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a ladywho got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes acrubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.--Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can seethem. Whats keeping our friend?He turned.A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering inall directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after themMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face,talking with J. J. OMolloy.--Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.He set off again to walk by Stephens side.    RETURN OF BLOOM--Yes, he said. I see them.Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near theoffices of the IRISH CATHOLIC AND DUBLIN PENNY JOURNAL, called:--Mr Crawford! A moment!--TELEGRAPH! Racing special!--What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.A newsboy cried in Mr Blooms face:--Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!    INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR--Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyesjust now. Hell give a renewal for two months, he says. After hell see.But he wants a par to call attention in the TELEGRAPH too, the Saturdaypink. And he wants it copied if its not too late I told councillorNannetti from the KILKENNY PEOPLE. I can have access to it in the nationallibrary. House of keys, dont you see? His name is Keyes. Its a play onthe name. But he practically promised hed give the renewal. But he wantsjust a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?    K.M.A.--Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing outhis arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.Lenehans yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder isthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on himtoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in mucksomewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?--Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design Isuppose its worth a short par. Hed give the ad, I think. Ill tellhim ...    K.M.R.I.A.--He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over hisshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strodeon jerkily.    RAISING THE WIND--NULLA BONA, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. Im up tohere. Ive been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow toback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take thewill for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the windanyhow.J. J. OMolloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caughtup on the others and walked abreast.--When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twentyfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to therailings.--Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two oldDublin women on the top of Nelsons pillar.    SOME COLUMN!--    THATS WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID--Thats new, Myles Crawford said. Thats copy. Out for the waxiesDargle. Two old trickies, what?--But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see theroofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines bluedome, Adam and Eves, saint Laurence OTooles. But it makes them giddy tolook so they pull up their skirts ...    THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES--Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. Were in thearchdiocese here.--And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statueof the onehandled adulterer.--Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea.I see what you mean.    DAMES DONATE DUBLINS CITS SPEEDPILLS    VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF--It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are tootired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums betweenthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with theirhandkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spittingthe plumstones slowly out between the railings.He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr OMaddenBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooneys.--Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.    SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON    PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. ITHACANS    VOW PEN IS CHAMP.--You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple ofGorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he werebitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble anda bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beautyfrom Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.They made ready to cross OConnell street.    HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionlesstrolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham,Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend andSandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, deliverywaggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats withrattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.    WHAT?--AND LIKEWISE--WHERE?--But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get theplums?    VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.    SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.--Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide toreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT.--No, Stephen said. I call it A PISGAH SIGHT OF PALESTINE OR THE PARABLEOF THE PLUMS.--I see, the professor said.He laughed richly.--I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. Wegave him that idea, he added to J. J. OMolloy.    HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAYJ. J. OMolloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue andheld his peace.--I see, the professor said.He halted on sir John Grays pavement island and peered aloft at Nelsonthrough the meshes of his wry smile.    DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING    FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLO    WANGLES--YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?--Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I mustsay.--Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almightystruth was known.    * * * * * * *Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch.

Manna. Live on fish, fishy fleshthey have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swimdown here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes.Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.They wheeled flapping weakly. Im not going to throw any more.Penny quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread footand mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tasteslike that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish arenot salty? How is that?His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchoron the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.KINOS/-TROUSERSGood idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How canyou own water really? Its always flowing in a stream, never the same,which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream.

Only big words for ordinary things on account of thesound. Shes not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I wasthinking. Still, I dont know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a basebarreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and youd think he was singinginto a barrel. Now, isnt that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Nothalf as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross.Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away numberone Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out. A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towardshim along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains.

I suggestedto him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sittinginside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet thatwould have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.Everyone dying to know what shes writing. Get twenty of them round youif you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity.Pillar of salt. Wouldnt have it of course because he didnt thinkof it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stainof black celluloid.

But glad to communicate with the outside world.Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet nametoo: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she hadmarried she would have changed. I suppose they really were short ofmoney. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them.My hearts broke eating dripping.

She didnt like it because I sprained my ankle first day she worechoir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwins tall hat done upwith some sticky stuff. Flies picnic too.

He and I behind. Sheet of her music blewout of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didnt. Thinglike that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linkingher in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts.Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be fornever. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Cornerof Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts andher boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind.Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those piecesof lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And themulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping thebusk of her stays: white.Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm fromher. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near twotaking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.That was the night ...--O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?--O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?--No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Havent seen her for ages.--In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down inMullingar, you know.--Go away! Isnt that grand for her?--Yes. In a photographers there. Getting on like a house on fire. How areall your charges?--All on the bakers list, Mrs Breen said.How many has she? No other in sight.--Youre in black, I see. You have no ...--No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Whos dead, when and what didhe die of? Turn up like a bad penny.--O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasnt any near relation.May as well get her sympathy.--Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.    YOUR FUNERALS TOMORROW    WHILE YOURE COMING THROUGH THE RYE.

Just: quietly: husband.--And your lord and master?Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasnt lost them anyhow.--O, dont be talking! she said. Hes a caution to rattlesnakes. Hes inthere now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has meheartscalded. Wait till I show you.Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypolypoured out from Harrisons. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of MrBlooms gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerarasugar, or theyd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefootarab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw ofhunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner.

Dream he had, a nightmare.Indiges.--Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.--The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.She took a folded postcard from her handbag.--Read that, she said. He got it this morning.--What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?--U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. Its a great shamefor them whoever he is.--Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.She took back the card, sighing.--And now hes going round to Mr Mentons office. Hes going to take anaction for ten thousand pounds, he says.She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seenits best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three oldgrapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tastydresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. Im hungry too.

Three days! Thats terriblefor her.Mrs Breen nodded.--She was taken bad on the Tuesday ...Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:--Mind! Let this man pass.A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with arapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as askullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, astick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.--Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!--Who is he if its a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?--His name is Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, MrBloom said smiling. Watch!--He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of thesedays.She broke off suddenly.--There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me toMolly, wont you?--I will, Mr Bloom said.He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. DenisBreen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrisonshugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like oldtimes. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust hisdull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.Meshuggah. Off his chump.Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight thetight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days.Watch him!  Out he goes again.

Isnt he in the insurance line?--Hes out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for theFREEMAN.--I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?--Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?--I noticed he was in mourning.--Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all athome. Youre right, by God. So he was.--I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see agentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.--Its not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.

I often saw him in here and Inever once saw him--you know, over the line.--God Almighty couldnt make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slipsoff when the fun gets too hot. Didnt you see him look at his watch? Ah,you werent there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outswith the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.--There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. Hes a safe man, Id say.--Hes not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.

Why we left the church of Rome.A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.No tram in sight. Wants to cross.--Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. Hemoved his head uncertainly.--Youre in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.Do you want to cross? Theres nothing in the way.The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Blooms eye followed itsline and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before Dragos. Where Isaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in JohnLongs. Slaking his drouth.--Theres a van there, Mr Bloom said, but its not moving. Ill see youacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?--Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.--Come, Mr Bloom said.He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand toguide it forward.Say something to him. Better not do the condescending.

Thats right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.--Thanks, sir.Knows Im a man. Voice.--Right now? First turn to the left.The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawinghis cane back, feeling again.Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbonetweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense ofvolume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonderwould he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea ofDublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walkin a beeline if he hadnt that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellowgoing in to be a priest.Penrose! That was that chaps name.Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.Tune pianos.

Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girlpassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them allon. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his minds eye. Thevoice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost seethe lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black,for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin.Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order twoshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationers just here too.Wait. Think over it.With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back abovehis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt theskin of his right cheek.

The walk. Not see. Get on.Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?Didnt see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Coldstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.No. Didnt see me. After two. Just at the gate.My heart!His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. SirThomas Deane was the Greek architecture.Look for something I.His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfoldedAgendath Netaim.

Gate.Safe!    * * * * * * *Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:--And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of WILHELM MEISTER. Agreat poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against asea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and astep backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him anoiseless beck.--Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautifulineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feelsthat Goethes judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by thedoor he gave his large ear all to the attendants words: heard them: and wasgone.Two left.--Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes beforehis death.--Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked withelders gall, to write PARADISE LOST at your dictation? THE SORROWSOF SATAN he calls it.Smile. Smile Cranlys smile.    FIRST HE TICKLED HER    THEN HE PATTED HER    THEN HE PASSED THE FEMALE CATHETER.

He laughedlow: a sizars laugh of Trinity: unanswered.    ORCHESTRAL SATAN, WEEPING MANY A ROOD    TEARS SUCH AS ANGELS WEEP.

And onemore to hail him: AVE, RABBI: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glenhe cooees for them. My souls youth I gave him, night by night. God speed.Good hunting.Mulligan has my telegram.Folly. Persist.--Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create afigure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeares Hamlet thoughI admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.--All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of hisshadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.Clergymens discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to usideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of artis out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau isthe painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamletbring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Platos world ofideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!--The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.Aristotle was once Platos schoolboy.--And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. Onecan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, theheavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos whosuffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon thealtar. I am the sacrificial butter.Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the NameIneffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is nosecret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching tosee if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light,born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane ofbuddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work offbad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrioussister H.P.B.s elemental.O, fie! Out ont! PFUITEUFEL! You naughtnt to look, missus, so younaughtnt when a ladys ashowing of her elemental.Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand withgrace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.--That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlets musings aboutthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant andundramatic monologue, as shallow as Platos.John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:--Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotlewith Plato.--Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from hiscommonwealth?Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness ofallhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in thestreet: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Throughspaces smaller than red globules of mans blood they creepycrawl afterBlakes buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.--Haines is gone, he said.--Is he?--I was showing him Jubainvilles book. Hes quite enthusiastic, dont youknow, about Hydes LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT. I couldnt bring him in tohear the discussion. Hes gone to Gills to buy it.    BOUND THEE FORTH, MY BOOKLET, QUICK    TO GREET THE CALLOUS PUBLIC.    WRIT, I WEEN, TWAS NOT MY WISH    IN LEAN UNLOVELY ENGLISH.--The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Greentwinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.--People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg ofRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in theworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasants heart on thehillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the livingmother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce thesixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flowerof corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to thepoor of heart, the life of Homers Phaeacians.From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.--Mallarme, dont you know, he said, has written those wonderful prosepoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one aboutHAMLET. He says: IL SE PROMENE, LISANT AU LIVRE DE LUI-MEME, dont youknow, READING THE BOOK OF HIMSELF. He describes HAMLET given in a Frenchtown, dont you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.    HAMLET    OU    LE DISTRAIT    PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE He repeated to John Eglintons newgathered frown:--PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE, dont you know. Its so French. The French pointof view. HAMLET OU ...--The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended. John Eglinton laughed.--Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, butdistressingly shortsighted in some matters. Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.--A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not fornothing was he a butchers son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spittingin his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his fathers one. Our Fatherwho art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets dont hesitate to shoot. Thebloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration campsung by Mr Swinburne.Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.    WHELPS AND DAMS OF MURDEROUS FOES WHOM NONE    BUT WE HAD SPARED ...Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.--He will have it that HAMLET is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for MrBests behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our fleshcreep.    LIST! LIST! O LIST!My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.    IF THOU DIDST EVER ...--What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has fadedinto impalpability through death, through absence, through change ofmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Parislies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from LIMBO PATRUM, returning tothe world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.Lifted.--It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swiftglance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. Thebear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers whosailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.--Shakespeare has left the huguenots house in Silver street and walks bythe swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the penchivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon hasother thoughts.Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!--The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in thecastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is theghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who hasstudied HAMLET all the years of his life which were not vanity in order toplay the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young playerwho stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:    HAMLET, I AM THY FATHERS SPIRIT,bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, youngHamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died inStratford that his namesake may live for ever.Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in thevesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words tohis own sons name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have beenprince Hamlets twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that hedid not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you arethe dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is theguilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?--But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell beganimpatiently.Art thou there, truepenny?--Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I meanwhen we read the poetry of KING LEAR what is it to us how the poet lived?As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de lIsle has said.Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poets drinking,the poets debts. We have KING LEAR: and it is immortal.Mr Bests face, appealed to, agreed.    FLOW OVER THEM WITH YOUR WAVES AND WITH YOUR WATERS, MANANAAN,    MANANAAN MACLIR ...How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?Marry, I wanted it.Take thou this noble.Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnsons bed, clergymansdaughter. Agenbite of inwit.Do you intend to pay it back?O, yes.When? Now?Well ... No.When, then?I paid my way. I paid my way.Steady on.

I.A.E.I.O.U.--Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? JohnEglintons carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.She died, for literature at least, before she was born.--She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She sawhim into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore hischildren and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when helay on his deathbed.Mothers deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought meinto this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. LILIATARUTILANTIUM.I wept alone.John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.--The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got outof it as quickly and as best he could.--Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. Hiserrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.--A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery,one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn fromXanthippe?--Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughtsinto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (ABSIT NOMEN!),Socratididions Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. Butneither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from thearchons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.--But Ann Hathaway? Mr Bests quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seemto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.His look went from brooders beard to carpers skull, to remind, tochide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltlessthough maligned.--He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling THEGIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME. If the earthquake did not time it we should knowwhere to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studdedbridle and her blue windows. That memory, VENUS AND ADONIS, lay in thebedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrewillfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think thewriter of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in theback of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to liewithal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomenare the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their willAnn hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him,sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis,stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfacedStratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.And my turn? When?Come!--Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,brightly.He murmured then with blond delight for all:    BETWEEN THE ACRES OF THE RYE    THESE PRETTY COUNTRYFOLK WOULD LIE.Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled itscooperative watch.--I am afraid I am due at the HOMESTEAD.Whither away? Exploitable ground.--Are you going? John Eglintons active eyebrows asked. Shall we see youat Moores tonight? Piper is coming.--Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.--I dont know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get awayin time.Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.

IN QUINTESSENTIAL TRIVIALITY    FOR YEARS IN THIS FLESHCASE A SHESOUL DWELT.--They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together asheaf of our younger poets verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,lighted, shone.See this. Remember.Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on hisashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly withtwo index fingers. Aristotles experiment. One or two? Necessity is that invirtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat isone hat.Listen.Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.Longworth will give it a good puff in the EXPRESS. O, will he? I likedColums DROVER. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you thinkhe has genius really? Yeats admired his line: AS IN WILD EARTH A GRECIANVASE. Did he? I hope youll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan iscoming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear MissMitchells joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyns wildoats? Awfully clever, isnt it? They remind one of Don Quixote and SanchoPanza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore isthe man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With asaffron kilt? ONeill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We arebecoming important, it seems.Cordelia. CORDOGLIO. Lirs loneliest daughter.Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.--Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be sokind as to give the letter to Mr Norman ...--O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so muchcorrespondence.--I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.God ild you. The pigs paper. Bullockbefriending.Synge has promised me an article for DANA too. Are we going to beread? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope youwill come round tonight. Bring Starkey.Stephen sat down.The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his masksaid:--Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of achopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:--Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inwardlight?--Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first asundering.--Yes.Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Womenhe won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bullytapsters wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured bodythat once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leavesfalling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.--Yes. So you think ...The door closed behind the outgoer.Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm andbrooding air.A vestals lamp.Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have livedto do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities ofthe possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore whenhe lived among women.Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice ofwords. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard thevoice of that Egyptian highpriest. IN PAINTED CHAMBERS LOADED WITHTILEBOOKS.They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch ofdeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak theirwill.--Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Othersabide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.--But HAMLET is so personal, isnt it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind ofprivate paper, dont you know, of his private life. I mean, I dont care abutton, dont you know, who is killed or who is guilty ...He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling hisdefiance. His private papers in the original. TA AN BAD AR AN TIR. TAIM IN MOSHAGART. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:--I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but Imay as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeareis Hamlet you have a stern task before you.Bear with me.Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern underwrinkled brows. A basilisk. E QUANDO VEDE LUOMO LATTOSCA. MesserBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.--As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artistweave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is whereit was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stufftime after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of theunliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when themind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am andthat which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister ofthe past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that whichthen I shall be.Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.--Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitternessmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from theson.Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.--That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.--If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug inthe market. The plays of Shakespeares later years which Renan admired somuch breathe another spirit.--The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.--There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been asundering.Said that.--If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over thehell of time of KING LEAR, OTHELLO, HAMLET, TROILUS AND CRESSIDA, look tosee when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man,shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince ofTyre?Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.--A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.--The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constantquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead tothe town.Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacons wild oats.Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. Whattown, good masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.East of the sun, west of the moon: TIR NA N-OG. Booted the twain andstaved.    HOW MANY MILES TO DUBLIN?    THREE SCORE AND TEN, SIR.    WILL WE BE THERE BY CANDLELIGHT?--Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closingperiod.--Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some averhis name is, say of it?--Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, thatwhich was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughters child.MY DEAREST WIFE, Pericles says, WAS LIKE THIS MAID. Will any man love thedaughter if he has not loved the mother?--The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. LART DETREGRAND ...--Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,another image?Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known toall men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quaeconcupiscimus ...--His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard ofall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. Theimages of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in themgrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.--I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of thepublic. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr GeorgeBernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles onShakespeare in the SATURDAY REVIEW were surely brilliant. Oddly enoughhe too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if thepoet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmonywith--what shall I say?--our notions of what ought not to have been.Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auks egg,prize of their fray.He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam?Dost love thy man?--That may be too, Stephen said. Theres a saying of Goethes which MrMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because youwill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a BUONAROBA, abay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, alordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had madehimself a coistrel gentleman and he had written ROMEO AND JULIET. Why?Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in acornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victorin his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and liedown. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undothe first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where lovelies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womansinvisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the fleshdriving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkeningeven his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the tworages commingle in a whirlpool.They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.--The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porchof a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot knowthe manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with thatknowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backsthat urged it King Hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowedwith knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovelyEnglish) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished,what he would but would not, go with him from Lucreces bluecircled ivoryglobes to Imogens breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goesback, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, anold dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes ontowards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom hehas written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is aghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinores rocks or what you will, theseas voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substanceof his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.--Amen! was responded from the doorway.Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?ENTRACTE.A ribald face, sullen as a deans, Buck Mulligan came forward, thenblithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.--You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he askedof Stephen.Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.They make him welcome. WAS DU VERLACHST WIRST DU NOCH DIENEN.Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sentHimself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by Hisfiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved oncrosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heavenand there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of HisOwn Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and deadwhen all the quick shall be dead already.Glo--o--ri--a in ex--cel--sis De--o.He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bellsaquiring.--Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.Mr Mulligan, Ill be bound, has his theory too of the play and ofShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.He smiled on all sides equally.Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:--Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.--To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes likeSynge.Mr Best turned to him.--Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? Hell see you after at theD. B. C. Hes gone to Gills to buy Hydes LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT.--I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?--The bards fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tiredperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress playedHamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Viningheld that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be anIrishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears(His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.--The most brilliant of all is that story of Wildes, Mr Best said,lifting his brilliant notebook. THAT PORTRAIT OF MR W. H. where he provesthat the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.--For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?--I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Ofcourse its all paradox, dont you know, Hughes and hews and hues, thecolour, but its so typical the way he works it out. Its the very essenceof Wilde, dont you know. The light touch.His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.Tame essence of Wilde.Youre darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasysducats.How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.Wit.

Yea, turtledove her.Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang ins kiss.--Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. Themocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.They talked seriously of mockers seriousness.Buck Mulligans again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, hishead wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. Hismobile lips read, smiling with new delight.--Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:--THE SENTIMENTALIST IS HE WHO WOULD ENJOY WITHOUT INCURRING THE IMMENSEDEBTORSHIP FOR A THING DONE. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch itfrom? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? Theaunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! MalachiMulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, youpriestified Kinchite!Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in aquerulous brogue:--Its what Im telling you, mister honey, its queer and sick we were,Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. Twas murmur we did fora gallus potion would rouse a friar, Im thinking, and he limp withleching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Conneryssitting civil waiting for pints apiece.He wailed:--And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending usyour conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long likethe drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.Stephen laughed.Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.--The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heardyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. Hes out in pampooties to murderyou.--Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdroppingceiling.--Murder you! he laughed.Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash oflights in rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras.Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing awinebottle. CEST VENDREDI SAINT! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering,he met. I mine. I met a fool ithe forest.--Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.-- ... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in hisDIARY OF MASTER WILLIAM SILENCE has found the hunting terms ... Yes? Whatis it?--Theres a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward andoffering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of theKILKENNY PEOPLE for last year.--Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman? ...He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced,looked, asked, creaked, asked:--Is he? ... O, there!Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talkedwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, mosthonest broadbrim.--This gentleman? FREEMANS JOURNAL? KILKENNY PEOPLE? To be sure. Goodday, sir. KILKENNY ... We have certainly ...A patient silhouette waited, listening.--All the leading provincial ... NORTHERN WHIG, CORK EXAMINER,ENNISCORTHY GUARDIAN,  ... Will you please? ... Evans,conduct this gentleman ... If you just follow the atten ... Or, pleaseallow me ... This way ... Please, sir ...Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowingdark figure following his hasty heels.The door closed.--The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.He jumped up and snatched the card.--Whats his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.He rattled on:--Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in themuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouththat has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.LIFE OF LIFE, THY LIPS ENKINDLE.Suddenly he turned to Stephen:--He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greekerthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! THE GOD PURSUING THEMAIDEN HID.--We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Bests approval.We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if atall, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.--Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beautyfrom Kyrios Menelaus brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy inwhom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty yearshe lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equalto that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art,more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art ofsurfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses,marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, whenthey arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pairof fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to viewith her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial loveand its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.You know Manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade Dick Burbageto her bed after she had seen him in RICHARD III and how Shakespeare,overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the hornsand, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the caponsblankets: WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CAME BEFORE RICHARD III. And the gaylakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, ladyPenelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punksof the bankside, a penny a time.Cours la Reine. ENCORE VINGT SOUS. NOUS FERONS DE PETITES COCHONNERIES.MINETTE? TU VEUX?--The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxfords motherwith her cup of canary for any cockcanary.Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:--Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!--And Harry of six wives daughter. And other lady friends fromneighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all thosetwenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doingbehind the diamond panes?Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard,herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lidsof Junos eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglintons desk sharply.--Whom do you suspect? he challenged.--Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twicespurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.Love that dare not speak its name.--As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loveda lord.Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.--It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for allother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for thestallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had ashrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Twodeeds are rank in that ghosts mind: a broken vow and the dullbrainedyokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husbands brother. SweetAnn, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.Stephen turned boldly in his chair.--The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If youdeny that in the fifth scene of HAMLET he has branded her with infamy tellme why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between theday she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw theirmen down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dearWillun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go,Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, herhusband too, while Susans daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddyswords, wed her second, having killed her first.O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royalLondon to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathersshepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he hascommended her to posterity.He faced their silence.To whom thus Eglinton:        You mean the will.    But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.    She was entitled to her widows dower    At common law. His legal knowledge was great    Our judges tell us.        Him Satan fleers,    Mocker:        And therefore he left out her name    From the first draft but he did not leave out    The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,    For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford    And in London. And therefore when he was urged,    As I believe, to name her    He left her his    Secondbest    Bed.                PUNKT.    Leftherhis    Secondbest    Leftherhis    Bestabed    Secabest    Leftabed.Woa!--Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, asthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.--He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms andlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalistshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her hisbest bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?--It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest,Mr Secondbest Best said finely.--SEPARATIO A MENSA ET A THALAMO, bettered Buck Mulligan and wassmiled on.--Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.Let me think.--Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, paystribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of hisdead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (dont forgetNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.--Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean ...--He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for aking. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!--What? asked Besteglinton.William Shakespeare and company, limited. The peoples William.For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house ...--Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thoughtof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his handsand said: ALL WE CAN SAY IS THAT LIFE RAN VERY HIGH IN THOSE DAYS. Lovely!Catamite.--The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best tougling Eglinton.Steadfast John replied severe:--The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cakeand have it.Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?--And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his ownlong pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself acornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famineriots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned byChettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued afellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound offlesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubreys ostler andcallboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylockchimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of thequeens leech Lopez, his jews heart being plucked forth while the sheenywas yet alive: HAMLET AND MACBETH with the coming to the throne of aScotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada ishis jeer in LOVES LABOUR LOST. His pageants, the histories, sailfullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits aretried and we have a porters theory of equivocation. The SEA VENTURE comeshome from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with PatsyCaliban, our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidneys. As forfay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired THEMERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life longfor deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.I think youre getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture oftheolologicophilolological. MINGO, MINXI, MICTUM, MINGERE.--Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,expectantly. Your dean ofstudies holds he was a holy Roman.SUFFLAMINANDUS SUM.--He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion Frenchpolisher of Italian scandals.--A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.AMPLIUS. IN SOCIETATE HUMANA HOC EST MAXIME NECESSARIUM UT SIT AMICITIAINTER MULTOS.--Saint Thomas, Stephen began ...--Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.There he keened a wailing rune.--POGUE MAHONE! ACUSHLA MACHREE! Its destroyed we are from this day! Itsdestroyed we are surely!All smiled their smiles.--Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoyreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint differentfrom that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in hiswise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the loveso given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from somestranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians taxwith avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built upthe hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter)bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sinsor virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man whoholds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debtswill hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he callshis wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or hismanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.--Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.--Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.--Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.--The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Willswidow, is the will to die.--REQUIESCAT! Stephen prayed.    WHAT OF ALL THE WILL TO DO?    IT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO ...--She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobledqueen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as amotorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Placeand drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed heslept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had readto her his chapbooks preferring them to the MERRY WIVES and, loosing hernightly waters on the jordan, she thought over HOOKS AND EYES FORBELIEVERS BREECHES and THE MOST SPIRITUAL SNUFFBOX TO MAKE THE MOSTDEVOUT SOULS SNEEZE. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite ofinwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom gropingfor its god.--History shows that to be true, INQUIT EGLINTONUS CHRONOLOLOGOS. The agessucceed one another. But we have it on high authority that a mans worstenemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell isright. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that onlyfamily poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel thatthe fat knight is his supreme creation.Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, suppingwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade ithim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, theres a gentlemanto see you. Me? Says hes your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. EnterMagee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with abuttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests,a wand of wilding in his hand.Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside Itouched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny isattending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.--A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessaryevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death. Ifyou hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, withthirtyfive years of life, NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN DI NOSTRA VITA, with fiftyof experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then youmust hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. Thecorpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour itrots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised thatmystical estate upon his son. Boccaccios Calandrino was the first andlast man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense ofconscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, anapostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mysteryand not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flungto the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovablybecause founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Uponincertitude, upon unlikelihood. AMOR MATRIS, subjective and objectivegenitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legalfiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or heany son?What the hell are you driving at?I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.AMPLIUS. ADHUC. ITERUM. POSTEA.Are you condemned to do this?--They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminalannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbicsisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers,jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn marsbeauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is anew male: his growth is his fathers decline, his youth his fathers envy,his friend his fathers enemy.In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.--What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.Am I a father? If I were?Shrunken uncertain hand.--Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of thefield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin,with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the fatherwho has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be ason? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the samename in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his ownson merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father ofall his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborngrandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Mageeunderstands her, abhors perfection.Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladlyglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.--Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big withchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! Theplays the thing! Let me parturiate!He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.--As for his family, Stephen said, his mothers name lives in the forestof Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia inCORIOLANUS. His boysons death is the deathscene of young Arthur in KINGJOHN. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls inTHE TEMPEST, in PERICLES, in WINTERS TALE are we know. Who Cleopatra,fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there isanother member of his family who is recorded.--The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake,with haste, quake, quack.Door closed. Cell. Day.They list. Three. They.I you he they.Come, mess.STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in hisold age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gathererone time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter upin Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man ons back. The playhouse sausagefilled Gilberts soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard arerecorded in the works of sweet William.MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! Whats in a name?BEST: That is my name, Richard, dont you know. I hope you are going tosay a good word for Richard, dont you know, for my sake.

I dont want Richard,my name ...                (Laughter)QUAKERLYSTER: (A TEMPO) But he that filches from me my good name ...STEPHEN: (STRINGENDO) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William,in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy sethis face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnetswhere there is Will in overplus. Like John oGaunt his name is dear to him,as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear orsteeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory ofgreatest shakescene in the country. Whats in a name? That is what we askourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. Astar, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in theheavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shoneover delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is thesignature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying onthe horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summerfields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.Both satisfied. I too.Dont tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.And from her arms.Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?Read the skies. AUTONTIMORUMENOS. BOUS STEPHANOUMENOS. Wheresyour configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: SUA DONNA.GIA: DI LUI. GELINDO RISOLVE DI NON AMARE S. D.--What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestialphenomenon?--A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.What mores to speak?Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.STEPHANOS, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape ofmy feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.--You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own nameis strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.Me, Magee and Mulligan.Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.PATER, AIT. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:--Thats very interesting because that brother motive, dont you know, wefind also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothersShakespeare. In Grimm too, dont you know, the fairytales. The thirdbrother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.The quaker librarian springhalted near.--I should like to know, he said, which brother you ... I understand youto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers ... Butperhaps I am anticipating?He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.An attendant from the doorway called:--Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants ...--O, Father Dineen! Directly.Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.John Eglinton touched the foil.--Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard andEdmund. You kept them for the last, didnt you?--In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie andnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. Abrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.Lapwing.Where is your brother? Apothecaries hall. My whetstone. Him, thenCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. Theymock to try you. Act. Be acted on.Lapwing.I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.On.--You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which hetook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowedAnn (whats in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all hiskings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeares reverence,the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of KING LEAR in which Edmundfigures lifted out of Sidneys ARCADIA and spatchcocked on to a Celticlegend older than history?--That was Wills way, John Eglinton defended. We should not nowcombine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.QUE VOULEZ-VOUS? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast andmakes Ulysses quote Aristotle.--Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or theusurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare,what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment,banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedlyfrom THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA onward till Prospero breaks his staff,buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doublesitself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeatsitself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeatsitself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughterSusan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it wasthe original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened hiswill and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words arethose of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like originalsin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is betweenthe lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstoneunder which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite varietyeverywhere in the world he has created, in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, twicein AS YOU LIKE IT, in THE TEMPEST, in HAMLET, in MEASURE FOR MEASURE--andin all the other plays which I have not read.He laughed to free his mind from his minds bondage.Judge Eglinton summed up.--The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He isall in all.--He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.All in all. In CYMBELINE, in OTHELLO he is bawd and cuckold. He acts andis acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills thereal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselesslywilling that the moor in him shall suffer.--Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!Dark dome received, reverbed.--And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.When all is said Dumas FILS (or is it Dumas PERE?) is right. After GodShakespeare has created most.--Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns aftera life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he hasalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of lifeended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion isended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet PERE and Hamlet FILS. A king and aprince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murderedand betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner,sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to bedivorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero,the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpas lump of love, and nuncle Richie,the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggersgo. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in hisworld within as possible. Maeterlinck says: IF SOCRATES LEAVE HIS HOUSETODAY HE WILL FIND THE SAGE SEATED ON HIS DOORSTEP. IF JUDAS GO FORTHTONIGHT IT IS TO JUDAS HIS STEPS WILL TEND. Every life is many days,day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants,old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meetingourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote itbadly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord ofthings as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call DIO BOIA,hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher,and would be bawd and cuckold too but  that in the economy of heaven,foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, anandrogynous angel, being a wife unto himself.--EUREKA! Buck Mulligan cried. EUREKA!Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglintonsdesk.--May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.He began to scribble on a slip of paper.Take some slips from the counter going out.--Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shalllive. The rest shall keep as they are.He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each hisvariorum edition of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.--You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You havebrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe yourown theory?--No, Stephen said promptly.--Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it adialogue, dont you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.John Eclecticon doubly smiled.--Well, in that case, he said, I dont see why you should expect paymentfor it since you dont believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is somemystery in HAMLET but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper metin Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secretis hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the presentduke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays.It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or helpme to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? EGOMEN. Who to unbelieve? Otherchap.--You are the only contributor to DANA who asks for pieces of silver. ThenI dont know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an articleon economics.Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.--For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: andthen gravely said, honeying malice:--I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upperMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the SUMMA CONTRAGENTILES in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie,the coalquay whore.He broke away.--Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your ortsand offals.Stephen rose.Life is many days. This will end.--We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. NOTRE AMI Moore saysMalachi Mulligan must be there.Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.--Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth ofIreland. Ill be there.

Five tothree. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boys name again?Dignam. Yes. VERE DIGNUM ET IUSTUM EST. Brother Swan was the person tosee. Mr Cunninghams letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practicalcatholic: useful at mission time.A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of hiscrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of thesisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the veryreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for hispurse held, he knew, one silver crown.Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not forlong, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off bycannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinalWolseys words: IF I HAD SERVED MY GOD AS I HAVE SERVED MY KING HE WOULDNOT HAVE ABANDONED ME IN MY OLD DAYS. He walked by the treeshade ofsunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David SheehyM.P.--Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxtonprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well atBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to besure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was veryprobable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David SheehyM.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David SheehyM.P. Yes, he would certainly call.--Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at thejet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, ingoing. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on FatherBernard Vaughans droll eyes and cockney voice.--Pilate! Wy dont you old back that owlin mob?A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in.his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved theIrish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner ofMountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha.And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And whatwas his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the otherlittle man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name tohave.Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynamand pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.--But mind you dont post yourself into the box, little man, he said.The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:--O, sir.--Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmeesletter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoysquare east.Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slatefrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers,canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportmentmost respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at thecorner of Dignams court.Was that not Mrs MGuinness?Mrs MGuinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee fromthe farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled andsaluted. How did she do?A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And tothink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a ... what should hesay? ... such a queenly mien.Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at theshutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will(D.V.)speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say afew words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They actedaccording to their lights.Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. Allraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.Christian brother boys.Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. SaintJosephs church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. FatherConmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionallythey were also badtempered.Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthriftnobleman. And now it was an office or something.Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and wassaluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odoursthat came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passedGrogans the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things werecontinually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.Still, an act of perfect contrition.Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him andwere saluted.Father Conmee passed H. J. ONeills funeral establishment whereCorny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade ofhay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmeesaluted the constable. In Youkstetters, the porkbutchers, Father Conmeeobserved pigs puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled intubes.Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw aturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saintFrancis Xaviers church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outwardbound tram.Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC. C. of saint Agathas church, north William street, on to Newcomenbridge.At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorum.It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, FatherConmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,tiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,sweetly.Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seat.Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket anda marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU, MY CHILD, that they have been absolved, PRAYFOR ME. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poorcreatures.From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather Conmee.Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, LENOMBRE DES ELUS, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were Gods souls, created byGod. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, awaste, if one might say.At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by theconductor and saluted in his turn.The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road andname. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old timesin the barony.Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book OLD TIMES IN THEBARONY and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and ofMary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of loughEnnel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in theevening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth?Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had notcommitted adultery fully, EIACULATIO SEMINIS INTER VAS NATURALE MULIERIS,with her husbands brother? She would half confess if she had not allsinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husbands brother.Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, neededhowever for mans race on earth, and of the ways of God which were notour ways.Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He washumane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and hesmiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with fullfruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble tonoble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.It was a charming day.The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. MOUTONNER, the Frenchsaid. A just and homely word.Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.He was their rector: his reign was mild.Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.An ivory bookmark told him the page.Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.Father Conmee read in secret PATER and AVE and crossed his breast.DEUS IN ADIUTORIUM.He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading tillhe came to RES in BEATI IMMACULATI: PRINCIPIUM VERBORUM TUORUM VERITAS:IN ETERNUM OMNIA INDICIA IUSTITIAE TUAE.A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him camea young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young manraised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow caredetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of hisbreviary. Sin: PRINCIPES PERSECUTI SUNT ME GRATIS: ET A VERBIS TUISFORMIDAVIT COR MEUM.    * * * * *Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with hisdrooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himselferect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brassfurnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came tothe doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes andleaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram onNewcomen bridge.Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hatdowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.Constable C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.--Thats a fine day, Mr Kelleher.--Ay, Corny Kelleher said.--Its very close, the constable said.Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouthwhile a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth acoin.--Whats the best news? he asked.--I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with batedbreath.    * * * * *A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnells corner,skirting Rabaiottis icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.Towards Larry ORourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growledunamiably:--For England ...He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus,halted and growled:--HOME AND BEAUTY.J. J. OMolloys white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert wasin the warehouse with a visitor.A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and droppedit into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glancedsourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forwardfour strides.He halted and growled angrily:--FOR ENGLAND ...Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his headtowards a window and bayed deeply:--HOME AND BEAUTY.The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTSslipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen,held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A womanshand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into theminstrels cap, saying:--There, sir.    * * * * *Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteamingkitchen.--Did you put in the books? Boody asked.Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubblingsuds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.--They wouldnt give anything on them, she said.Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsockedankles tickled by stubble.--Where did you try? Boody asked.--MGuinnesss.Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.--Bad cess to her big face! she cried.Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.--Whats in the pot? she asked.--Shirts, Maggy said.Boody cried angrily:--Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:--And whats in this?A heavy fume gushed in answer.--Peasoup, Maggy said.--Where did you get it? Katey asked.--Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.The lacquey rang his bell.--Barang!Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:--Give us it here.Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouthrandom crumbs:--A good job we have that much. Wheres Dilly?--Gone to meet father, Maggy said.Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:--Our father who art not in heaven.Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Kateys bowl, exclaimed:--Boody! For shame!A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly downthe Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafedaround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,between the Customhouse old dock and Georges quay.    * * * * *The blond girl in Thorntons bedded the wicker basket with rustlingfibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paperand a small jar.--Put these in first, will you? he said.--Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.--Thatll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripeshamefaced peaches.Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about thefruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump redtomatoes, sniffing smells.H. E. L. Y.S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,plodding towards their goal.He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watchfrom his fob and held it at its chains length.--Can you send them by tram? Now?A darkbacked figure under Merchants arch scanned books on thehawkers cart.--Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?--O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.--Will you write the address, sir?Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.--Send it at once, will you? he said. Its for an invalid.--Yes, sir. I will, sir.Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers pocket.--Whats the damage? he asked.The blond girls slim fingers reckoned the fruits.Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. Hetook a red carnation from the tall stemglass.--This for me? he asked gallantly.The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tiea bit crooked, blushing.--Yes, sir, she said.Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of thered flower between his smiling teeth.--May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.    * * * * *--MA! Almidano Artifoni said.He gazed over Stephens shoulder at Goldsmiths knobby poll.Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Mens arms frankly round their stuntedforms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bankof Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.--ANCHIO HO AVUTO DI QUESTE IDEE, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, QUAND EROGIOVINE COME LEI. EPPOI MI SONO CONVINTO CHE IL MONDO E UNA BESTIA.PECCATO. PERCHE LA SUA VOCE ... SAREBBE UN CESPITE DI RENDITA, VIA.INVECE, LEI SI SACRIFICA.--SACRIFIZIO INCRUENTO, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slowswingswong from its midpoint, lightly.--SPERIAMO, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. MA, DIA RETTA AME. CI RIFLETTA.By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tramunloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.--CI RIFLETTERO, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.--MA, SUL SERIO, EH? Almidano Artifoni said.His heavy hand took Stephens firmly. Human eyes. They gazedcuriously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.--ECCOLO, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e cipensi. ADDIO, CARO.--ARRIVEDERLA, MAESTRO, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand wasfreed. E GRAZIE.--DI CHE? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? TANTE BELLE COSE!Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smugglingimplements of music through Trinity gates.    * * * * *Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of THE WOMAN IN WHITEfar back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into hertypewriter.Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogledthem: six.Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:-- June .Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypenys corner andthe slab where Wolfe Tones statue was not, eeled themselves turningH. E. L. Y.S and plodded back as they had come.Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette,and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capitalesses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. Shes not nicelooking, is she? Theway shes holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at theband tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirtlike Susy Nagles. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclubswells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he wont keep me heretill seven.The telephone rang rudely by her ear.--Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Ill ring them up after five. Onlythose two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can goafter six if youre not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven andsix. Ill tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.She scribbled three figures on an envelope.--Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you.Mr Lenehan, yes. He said hell be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes,sir. Ill ring them up after five.    * * * * *Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.--Whos that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?--Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.--Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute hispliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.The vesta in the clergymans uplifted hand consumed itself in a long softflame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy airclosed round them.--How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.--Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historiccouncil chamber of saint Marys abbey where silken Thomas proclaimedhimself a rebel in . This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.OMadden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. Theold bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and theoriginal jews temple was here too before they built their synagogue overin Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?--No, Ned.--He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if mymemory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.--Thats right, Ned Lambert said. Thats quite right, sir.--If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allowme perhaps ...--Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. Illget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here orfrom here.In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piledseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.--Im deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I wont trespass onyour valuable time ...--Youre welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Nextweek, say. Can you see?--Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.--Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath awayamong the pillars. With J. J. OMolloy he came forth slowly into Marysabbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnutmeal, OConnor, Wexford.He stood to read the card in his hand.--The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: SaintMichaels, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. Hes writing a book about theFitzgeralds he told me. Hes well up in history, faith.The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt aclinging twig.--I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. OMolloy said.Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.--God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildareafter he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? IM BLOODY SORRYI DID IT, says he, BUT I DECLARE TO GOD I THOUGHT THE ARCHBISHOP WASINSIDE. He mightnt like it, though. What? God, Ill tell him anyhow.That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all ofthem, the Geraldines.The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. Heslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:--Woa, sonny!He turned to J. J. OMolloy and asked:--Well, Jack. What is it? Whats the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after aninstant, sneezed loudly.--Chow! he said. Blast you!--The dust from those sacks, J. J. OMolloy said politely.--No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a ... cold night before ... blastyour soul ... night before last ... and there was a hell of a lot ofdraught ...He held his handkerchief ready for the coming ...--I was ... Glasnevin this morning ... poor little ... what do you callhim ... Chow! ... Mother of Moses!    * * * * *Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against hisclaret waistcoat.--See? he said. Say its turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbleda while, ceased, ogling them: six.Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from theconsolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carryingthe costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from theadmiralty division of kings bench to the court of appeal an elderlyfemale with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt ofgreat amplitude.--See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.The impact. Leverage, see?He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.--Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late cansee what turn is on and what turns are over.--See? Tom Rochford said.He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:four. Turn Now On.--Ill see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One goodturn deserves another.--Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him Im Boylan with impatience.--Goodnight, MCoy said abruptly. When you two beginNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.--But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.--Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.He followed MCoy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.--Hes a hero, he said simply.--I know, MCoy said. The drain, you mean.--Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.They passed Dan Lowrys musichall where Marie Kendall, charmingsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichallLenehan showed MCoy how the whole thing was. One of those manholeslike a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, halfchoked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, bookys vestand all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope roundthe poor devil and the two were hauled up.--The act of a hero, he said.At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop pastthem for Jervis street.--This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynams tosee Sceptres starting price. Whats the time by your gold watch andchain?MCoy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses sombre office, then atONeills clock.--After three, he said. Whos riding her?--O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.While he waited in Temple bar MCoy dodged a banana peel withgentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damneasy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregalcavalcade.--Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons inthere going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasnt anearthly. Through here.They went up the steps and under Merchants arch. A darkbackedfigure scanned books on the hawkers cart.--There he is, Lenehan said.--Wonder what hes buying, MCoy said, glancing behind.--LEOPOLDO OR THE BLOOM IS ON THE RYE, Lenehan said.--Hes dead nuts on sales, MCoy said. I was with him one day and hebought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There werefine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon andcomets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.Lenehan laughed.--Ill tell you a damn good one about comets tails, he said. Come over inthe sun.They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay bythe riverwall.Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangans, lateFehrenbachs, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.--There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan saideagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayorwas there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawsonspoke and there was music. Bartell dArcy sang and Benjamin Dollard ...--I know, MCoy broke in. My missus sang there once.--Did she? Lenehan said.A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS reappeared on the windowsash ofnumber  Eccles street.He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.--But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had thecatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife werethere. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao towhich we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids camesolids. Cold joints galore and mince pies ...--I know, MCoy said. The year the missus was there ...Lenehan linked his arm warmly.--But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after allthe jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue oclock themorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous wintersnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on oneside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singingglees and duets: LO, THE EARLY BEAM OF MORNING. She was well primed with agood load of Delahunts port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloodycar gave I had her bumping up against me. Hells delights! She has a finepair, God bless her. Like that.He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:--I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Knowwhat I mean?His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight indelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.--The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. Shes a gameymare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the cometsin the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear andHercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I waslost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last shespotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. AND WHAT STAR IS THAT, POLDY? saysshe. By God, she had Bloom cornered. THAT ONE, IS IT? says Chris Callinan,SURE THATS ONLY WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A PINPRICK. By God, he wasnt farwide of the mark.Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with softlaughter.--Im weak, he gasped.MCoys white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched hishindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at MCoy.--Hes a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. Hes not oneof your common or garden ... you know ... Theres a touch of the artistabout old Bloom.    * * * * *Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of THE AWFUL DISCLOSURES OF MARIAMONK, then of Aristotles MASTERPIECE. Crooked botched print. Plates:infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughteredcows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. Allbutting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minutesomewhere. Mrs Purefoy.He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: TALES OF THE GHETTOby Leopold von Sacher Masoch.--That I had, he said, pushing it by.The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.--Them are two good ones, he said.Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruinedmouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them againsthis unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.On OConnell bridge many persons observed the grave deportmentand gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. FAIR TYRANTS by James Lovebirch.Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.He opened it. Thought so.A womans voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.No: she wouldnt like that much. Got her it once.He read the other title: SWEETS OF SIN. More in her line. Let us see.He read where his finger opened.--ALL THE DOLLARBILLS HER HUSBAND GAVE HER WERE SPENT IN THE STORES ONWONDROUS GOWNS AND COSTLIEST FRILLIES. FOR HIM! FOR RAOUL!Yes. This. Here. Try.--HER MOUTH GLUED ON HIS IN A LUSCIOUS VOLUPTUOUS KISS WHILE HIS HANDSFELT FOR THE OPULENT CURVES INSIDE HER DESHABILLE.Yes. Take this. The end.--YOU ARE LATE, HE SPOKE HOARSELY, EYING HER WITH A SUSPICIOUS GLARE.THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THREW OFF HER SABLETRIMMED WRAP, DISPLAYING HERQUEENLY SHOULDERS AND HEAVING EMBONPOINT. AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYEDROUND HER PERFECT LIPS AS SHE TURNED TO HIM CALMLY.Mr Bloom read again: THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yieldedamply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrilsarched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (FOR HIM! FORRAOUL!). Armpits oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (HER HEAVING EMBONPOINT!).Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!Young! Young!An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts ofchancery, kings bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in thelord chancellors court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiraltydivision the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairnsversus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservationof judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and GuaranteeCorporation.Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingycurtains. The shopmans uncombed grey head came out and his unshavenreddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on thefloor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, andbent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.Mr Bloom beheld it.Mastering his troubled breath, he said:--Ill take this one.The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.--SWEETS OF SIN, he said, tapping on it. Thats a good one.    * * * * *The lacquey by the door of Dillons auctionrooms shook his handbelltwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains.Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance onfive shillings? Going for five shillings.The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:--Barang!Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretchednecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williamssrow. He halted near his daughter.--Its time for you, she said.--Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are youtrying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?Melancholy God!Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on themand held them back.--Stand up straight, girl, he said. Youll get curvature of the spine.Do you know what you look like?He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching hisshoulders and dropping his underjaw.--Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.--Did you get any money? Dilly asked.--Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublinwould lend me fourpence.--You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.--How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldlyalong Jamess street.--I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?--I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taughtyou to be so saucy? Here.He handed her a shilling.--See if you can do anything with that, he said.--I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.--Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. Youre like the rest ofthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor motherdied. But wait awhile. Youll all get a short shrift and a long day fromme. Low blackguardism! Im going to get rid of you. Wouldnt care if I wasstretched out stiff. Hes dead. The man upstairs is dead.He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.--Well, what is it? he said, stopping.The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.--Barang!--Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bellbut feebly:--Bang!Mr Dedalus stared at him.--Watch him, he said. Its instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.--You got more than that, father, Dilly said.--Im going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. Ill leave youall where Jesus left the jews. Look, theres all I have. I got twoshillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for thefuneral.He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.--Cant you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.--I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in OConnellstreet. Ill try this one now.--Youre very funny, Dilly said, grinning.--Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk foryourself and a bun or a something. Ill be home shortly.He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, outof Parkgate.--Im sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.The lacquey banged loudly.Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with apursing mincing mouth gently:--The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldnt do anything!O, sure they wouldnt really! Is it little sister Monica!    * * * * *From the sundial towards Jamess gate walked Mr Kernan, pleasedwith the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly alongJamess street, past Shackletons offices. Got round him all right. How doyou do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in yourother establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.Lovely weather were having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Thosefarmers are always grumbling. Ill just take a thimbleful of your bestgin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that GeneralSlocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. Andheartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutalthing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Mostscandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehoseall burst. What I cant understand is how the inspectors ever allowed aboat like that ... Now, youre talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You knowwhy? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that.And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.I smiled at him. AMERICA, I said quietly, just like that. WHAT IS IT? THESWEEPINGS OF EVERY COUNTRY INCLUDING OUR OWN. ISNT THAT TRUE? Thatsa fact.Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where theres money going theresalways someone to pick it up.Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like adressy appearance. Bowls them over.--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of PeterKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawsonstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never builtunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street clubtoff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank,gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he rememberedme.Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of yourcustom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the oldsaying has it.North wall and sir John Rogersons quay, with hulls andanchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway,rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpybody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that NedLamberts brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. Hes as like it as damnit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flashlike that. Damn like him.Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Gooddrop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to hisfat strut.Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy blackrope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenantswife drove by in her noddy.Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great toperstoo. Fourbottle men.Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michans? Or no, there was amidnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door inthe wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turndown here. Make a detour.Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street bythe corner of Guinnesss visitors waitingroom. Outside the DublinDistillers Companys stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperarybosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in JohnHenry Mentons office, led his wife over OConnell bridge, bound for theoffice of Messrs Collis and Ward.Mr Kernan approached Island street.Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscencesof sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind ofretrospective arrangement. Gaming at Dalys. No cardsharping then.One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stablesbehind Moira house.Damn good gin that was.Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, thatsham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were onthe wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.Masterly rendition.    AT THE SIEGE OF ROSS DID MY FATHER FALL.A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outridersleaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!    * * * * *Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidarysfingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and theshowtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar,on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lightsshining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of theirbrows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. Asailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long andseafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and herhips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem,turned it and held it at the point of his Moses beard. Grandfather apegloating on a stolen hoard.And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsickwords of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheatstanding from everlasting to everlasting.Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged throughIrishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, onewith a midwifes bag in which eleven cockles rolled.The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from thepowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb alwayswithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I betweenthem. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatterthem, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you whocan. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A lookaround.Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. Yousay right, sir. A Monday morning, twas so, indeed.Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clackingagainst his shoulderblade. In Clohisseys window a faded O print ofHeenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stoodround the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposedgently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroeshearts.He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.--Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.Tattered pages. THE IRISH BEEKEEPER. LIFE AND MIRACLES OF THE CURE OFARS. POCKET GUIDE TO KILLARNEY.I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. STEPHANO DEDALO,ALUMNO OPTIMO, PALMAM FERENTI.Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through thehamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book ofMoses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read andread. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a womans love. For me this.Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:--SE EL YILO NEBRAKADA FEMININUM! AMOR ME SOLO! SANKTUS! AMEN.Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbotPeter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbotscharms, as mumbling Joachims. Down, baldynoddle, or well wool your wool.--What are you doing here, Stephen?Dillys high shoulders and shabby dress.Shut the book quick. Dont let see.--What are you doing? Stephen said.A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. Itglowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her ofParis. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeckbracelet, Dan Kellys token. NEBRAKADA FEMININUM.--What have you there? Stephen asked.--I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughingnervously. Is it any good?My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far anddaring. Shadow of my mind.He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenals French primer.--What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.Show no surprise. Quite natural.--Here, Stephen said. Its all right. Mind Maggy doesnt pawn it on you. Isuppose all my books are gone.--Some, Dilly said. We had to.She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She willdrown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,my heart, my soul. Salt green death.We.Agenbite of inwit. Inwits agenbite.Misery! Misery!    * * * * *--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughters. FatherCowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.--Whats the best news? Mr Dedalus said.--Why then not much, Father Cowley said. Im barricaded up, Simon, withtwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.--Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?--O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.--With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.--The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. Im justwaiting for Ben Dollard. Hes going to say a word to long John to get himto take those two men off. All I want is a little time.He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulgingin his neck.--I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! Hes alwaysdoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.--There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.Ben Dollards loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slopscrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards themat an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:--Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.--Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of BenDollards figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he mutteredsneeringly:--Thats a pretty garment, isnt it, for a summers day?--Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, Ithrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomyclothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:--They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.--Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be toGod hes not paid yet.--And how is that BASSO PROFONDO, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanters mouth, gaveforth a deep note.--Aw! he said.--Thats the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.--What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?He turned to both.--Thatll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse ofsaint Marys abbey past James and Charles Kennedys, rectifiers, attendedby Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford ofhurdles.Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,his joyful fingers in the air.--Come along with me to the subsheriffs office, he said. I want to showyou the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. Hes a cross between Lobengulaand Lynchehaun. Hes well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw JohnHenry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall ifI dont ... Wait awhile ... Were on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.--For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a danglingbutton of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped awaythe heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.--What few days? he boomed. Hasnt your landlord distrained for rent?--He has, Father Cowley said.--Then our friends writ is not worth the paper its printed on, Ben Dollardsaid. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. Windsor avenue. Love is the name?--Thats right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. Hes a ministerin the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?--You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put thatwrit where Jacko put the nuts.He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.--Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasseson his coatfront, following them.    * * * * *--The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passedout of the Castleyard gate.The policeman touched his forehead.--God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set ontowards Lord Edward street.Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedys head by Miss Douces head,appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.--Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to FatherConmee and laid the whole case before him.--You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.--Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after themquickly down Cork hill.On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailedAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.--Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the MAILoffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.--Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down thefive shillings too.--Without a second word either, Mr Power said.--Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.--Ill say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.They went down Parliament street.--Theres Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanaghs.--Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.Outside LA MAISON CLAIRE Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooneysbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while MartinCunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit,who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Andersons watches.--The assistant town clerks corns are giving him some trouble, John WyseNolan told Mr Power.They followed round the corner towards James Kavanaghswinerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. MartinCunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henrydid not glance.--And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large aslife.The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where hestood.--Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted andgreeted.Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Claydecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over alltheir faces.--Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he saidwith rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted toknow, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow themacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, noquorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and littleLorcan Sherlock doing LOCUM TENENS for him. Damned Irish language,language of our forefathers.Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, tothe assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan heldhis peace.--What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.--O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness sake tillI sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fannings flankand passed in and up the stairs.--Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I dont thinkyou knew him or perhaps you did, though.With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.--Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of longJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.--Rather lowsized. Dignam of Mentons office that was, MartinCunningham said. Long John Fanning could not remember him. Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.--Whats that? Martin Cunningham said.All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again.From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliamentstreet, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily theywent past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of theleaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.--What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up thestaircase.--The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John WyseNolan answered from the stairfoot.    * * * * *As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behindhis Panama to Haines:--Parnells brother. There in the corner.They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced manwhose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.--Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.--Yes, Mulligan said. Thats John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his greyclaw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe andfell once more upon a working corner.--Ill take a MELANGE, Haines said to the waitress.--Two MELANGES, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butterand some cakes as well.When she had gone he said, laughing:--We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missedDedalus on HAMLET.Haines opened his newbought book.--Im sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all mindsthat have lost their balance.The onelegged sailor growled at the area of  Nelson street:--ENGLAND EXPECTS ...Buck Mulligans primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.--You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. WanderingAengus I call him.--I am sure he has an IDEE FIXE, Haines said, pinching his chinthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it wouldbe likely to be. Such persons always have.Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.--They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will nevercapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the whitedeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.The joy of creation ...--Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled himthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. Itsrather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes aninteresting point out of that.Buck Mulligans watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped herto unload her tray.--He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amidthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, ofretribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does hewrite anything for your movement?He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whippedcream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butterover its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.--Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write somethingin ten years.--Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.Still, I shouldnt wonder if he did after all.He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.--This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.I dont want to be imposed on.Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks ofships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wappingstreet past Bensons ferry, and by the threemasted schooner ROSEVEAN fromBridgwater with bricks.    * * * * *Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewells yard.Behind him Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, withstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smithshouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him ablind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far asMr Lewis Werners cheerful windows, then turned and strode back alongMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.At the corner of Wildes house he halted, frowned at Elijahs nameannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance ofdukes lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteethbared he muttered:--COACTUS VOLUI.He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.As he strode past Mr Blooms dental windows the sway of hisdustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and sweptonwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned hissickly face after the striding form.--Gods curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! Youre blinder norI am, you bitchs bastard!    * * * * *Opposite Ruggy ODonohoes Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam,pawing the pound and a half of Mangans, late Fehrenbachs, porksteaks hehad been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was tooblooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley andMrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles andsipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought fromTunneys. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing thewhole blooming time and sighing.After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdressmilliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped totheir pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourningMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublins pet lamb, will meetsergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fiftysovereigns. Gob, thatd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,thats the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance,soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on hisleft turned as he turned. Thats me in mourning. When is it? May thetwentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the rightand on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar stickingup. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall,charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be inthe packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out ofhim for one time he found out.Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best puckergoing for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellowwould knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best puckerfor science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out ofhim, dodging and all.In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toffs mouthand a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk wastelling him and grinning all the time.No Sandymount tram.Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks tohis other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. Theblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming endto it. He met schoolboys with satchels. Im not going tomorrow either,stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice Im inmourning? Uncle Barney said hed get it into the paper tonight. Thentheyll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pas name.His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was afly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they werescrewing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringingit downstairs.Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney tellingthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high andheavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standingon the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunneys forto boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see himagain. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be agood son to ma. I couldnt hear the other things he said but I saw histongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam,my father. I hope hes in purgatory now because he went to confession toFather Conroy on Saturday night.    * * * * *William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied bylieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregallodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss deCourcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park salutedby obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along thenorthern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way throughthe metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the rivergreeted him vainly from afar Between Queens and Whitworth bridges lordDudleys viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr DudleyWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. Whites,the pawnbrokers, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nosewith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsboroughmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on footthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In theporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at thedoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for thePatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changedher plan and retracing her steps by Kings windows smiled credulouslyon the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quaywall under Tom Devans office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongueof liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold bybronze, Miss Kennedys head by Miss Douces head watched and admired.On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhousefor the subsheriffs office, stood still in midstreet and brought hishat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus greeting. FromCahills corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisanceunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignanthad held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and MCoy,taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by RogerGreenes office and Dollards big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,carrying the Catesbys cork lino letters for her father who was laid up,knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldnt seewhat Her Excellency had on because the tram and Springs big yellowfurniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lordlieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foots from the shaded door of Kavanaghswinerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lordlieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right HonourableWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Andersonsall times ticking watches and Henry and Jamess wax smartsuitedfreshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, DERNIER CRI James. Over againstDame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of thecavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him,took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat anddoffed his cap to her. A charming SOUBRETTE, great Marie Kendall, withdauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon WilliamHumble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, andalso upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of theD. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on theviceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of formsdarkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. InFowness street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward fromChardenals first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokesspinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway ofCommercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat goldhunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where theforeleg of King Billys horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked herhastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shoutedin his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his leftbreast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonbys corner a jadedwhite flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behindhim, E.L.YS, while outriders pranced past and carriages. OppositePigotts music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.By the provosts wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoesand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of MY GIRLS A YORKSHIREGIRL.Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders skyblue frontlets and highaction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suitof indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but heoffered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the redflower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellencydrew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music whichwas being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddiesblared and drumthumped after the CORTEGE:    BUT THOUGH SHES A FACTORY LASS    AND WEARS NO FANCY CLOTHES.    BARAABUM.    YET IVE A SORT OF A    YORKSHIRE RELISH FOR    MY LITTLE YORKSHIRE ROSE.    BARAABUM.Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finnshotel Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through afierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons inthe window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster streetby Trinitys postern a loyal kings man, Hornblower, touched his tallyhocap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master PatrickAloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with thetopper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased byporksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way toinaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercers hospital,drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blindstripling opposite Broadbents. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in abrown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across theviceroys path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr EugeneStratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroketownship. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves,an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonderthe lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. OnNorthumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctuallysalutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at thegarden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen whenvisiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in and the salute of Almidano Artifonis sturdy trousers swallowed by aclosing door.    * * * * * * *Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing Imperthnthn thnthnthn.Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.Horrid!

Tempting poor simple males.Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.--O go away! she said. Youre very simple, I dont think.He was.--Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christenedme simple Simon.--You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did thedoctor order today?--Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think Ill trouble youfor some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.Jingle.--With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell andCochranes she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of goldwhisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalusbrought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue twohusky fifenotes.--By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must bea great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last,they say. Yes. Yes.Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaids, intothe bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.None nought said nothing.

Blue bloom is on the rye.--He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.Lenehan came forward.--Was Mr Boylan looking for me?He asked. She answered:--Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised,her gaze upon a page:--No. He was not.Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.

O my!He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.--Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.--Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?--Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.Dry.Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.--I see, he said. I didnt recognise him for the moment. I hear he iskeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?He had.--I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. InMooneys EN VILLE and in Mooneys SUR MER. He had received the rhino forthe labour of his muse.He smiled at bronzes teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:--The ELITE of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, HughMacHugh, Dublins most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boyof the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of theOMadden Burke.After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and--That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set downhis glass.He looked towards the saloon door.--I see you have moved the piano.--The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smokingconcert and I never heard such an exquisite player.--Is that a fact?--Didnt he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,poor fellow. Not twenty Im sure he was.--Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.He drank and strayed away.--So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.Gods curse on bitchs bastard.Tink to her pity cried a diners bell. To the door of the bar anddiningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter ofOrmond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, forjinglejaunty blazes boy.Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at theoblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressedindulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see thethicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I wasin Wisdom Helys wise Bloom in Dalys Henry Flower bought.

Longer in dying call.Pat paid for diners popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray andpopcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with missDouce.--THE BRIGHT STARS FADE ...A voiceless song sang from within, singing:-- ...

Dinner fit for a prince.Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm,her bust, that all but burst, so high.--O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.--Why dont you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for hislips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), andsyrupped with her voice:--Fine goods in small parcels.That is to say she.

Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalicetiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes wentafter, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gildedarch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell,where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.Yes, bronze from anearby.-- ...

Im coming.He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by thethreshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.--How do you do, Mr Dollard?--Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollards vague bass answered, turning aninstant from Father Cowleys woe. He wont give you any trouble, Bob. AlfBergan will speak to the long fellow. Well put a barleystraw in thatJudas Iscariots ear this time.Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing aneyelid.--Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon.

Wheresmy pipe, by the way?He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carriedtwo diners drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.--I saved the situation, Ben, I think.--You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. Thatwas a brilliant idea, Bob.Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved thesitua. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.--I knew he was on the rocks, he said.

Желтый халат его, враспояску, слегка вздымался за ним на мягком утреннем ветерке.Он поднял чашку перед собою и возгласил[]:    [].Остановясь, он вгляделся вниз, в сумрак винтовой лестницы, и грубо крикнул: Выходи, Клинк! Выходи, иезуит несчастный!Торжественно он проследовал вперед и взошел на круглую орудийную площадку[]. Обернувшись по сторонам, он с важностью троекратно благословил башню, окрестный берег и пробуждающиеся горы. Потом, увидев Стивена Дедала, наклонился к нему и начал быстро крестить воздух, булькая горлом и подергивая головой. Стивен Дедал, недовольный и заспанный, облокотясь на последнюю ступеньку, холодно смотрел на дергающееся булькающее лицо, что благословляло его, длинное как у лошади, и на бестонзурную шевелюру, белесую, словно окрашенную под светлый дуб.Бык Маллиган заглянул под зеркальце и тут же опять прикрыл чашку. По казармам!  скомандовал он сурово.И пастырским голосом продолжал: Ибо сие, о возлюбленные мои, есть истинная Христина, тело и кровь, печенки и селезенки. Музыку медленней, пожалуйста. Господа, закройте глаза. Минуту. Маленькая заминка, знаете, с белыми шариками. Всем помолчать.Он устремил взгляд искоса вверх, издал долгий, протяжный призывный свист и замер, напряженно прислушиваясь. Белые ровные зубы кой-где поблескивали золотыми крупинками. Златоуст. Резкий ответный свист дважды прозвучал в тишине. Спасибо, старина,  живо откликнулся он.  Так будет чудненько. Можешь выключать ток!Он соскочил с площадки и с важностью поглядел на своего зрителя, собирая у ног складки просторного халата. Жирное затененное лицо и тяжелый овальный подбородок напоминали средневекового прелата[], покровителя искусств. Довольная улыбка показалась у него на губах. Смех да и только,  сказал он весело.  Это нелепое твое имя, как у древнего грека.Ткнув пальцем с дружелюбной насмешкой, он отошел к парапету, посмеиваясь. Стивен Дедал, поднявшись до конца лестницы, устало побрел за ним, но, не дойдя, уселся на край площадки и принялся наблюдать, как тот, пристроив на парапете зеркальце и обмакнув в пену помазок, намыливает шею и щеки.Веселый голос Быка Маллигана не умолкал: У меня тоже нелепое  Мэйлахи Маллиган, два дактиля. Но тут звучит что-то эллинское, правда ведь? Что-то солнечное и резвое, как сам бычок. Мы непременно должны поехать в Афины. Поедешь, если я раздобуду у тетушки двадцать фунтов?Он положил помазок и в полном восторге воскликнул: Это он-то поедет? Изнуренный иезуит.Оборвал себя и начал тщательно бриться. Послушай, Маллиган,  промолвил Стивен негромко. Да, моя радость? Долго еще Хейнс будет жить в башне?Бык Маллиган явил над правым плечом свежевыбритую щеку. Кошмарная личность, а?  сказал он от души.  Этакий толстокожий сакс. Он считает, что ты не джентльмен. Эти мне гнусные англичане! Их так и пучит от денег и от запоров. Он, видите ли, из Оксфорда. А знаешь, Дедал, вот у тебя-то настоящий оксфордский стиль. Он все никак тебя не раскусит. Нет, лучшее тебе имя придумал я: Клинк, острый клинок.Он выбривал с усердием подбородок. Всю ночь бредил про какую-то черную пантеру,  проговорил Стивен.  Где у него ружье? Совсем малый спятил,  сказал Маллиган.  А ты перетрусил не на шутку? Еще бы,  произнес Стивен с энергией и нарастающим страхом.  В кромешном мраке, с каким-то незнакомцем, который стонет и бредит, что надо застрелить пантеру. Ты спасал тонущих[]. Но я, знаешь ли, не герой. Если он тут останется, я ухожу.Бык Маллиган глядел, насупясь, на бритву, покрытую мыльной пеной. Соскочив со своего возвышения, он торопливо стал рыться в карманах брюк. Драла!  пробормотал он сквозь зубы.Вернувшись к площадке, он запустил руку в верхний карман Стивена и сказал: Позвольте одолжиться вашим сморкальником, вытереть нашу бритву.Стивен покорно дал ему вытащить и развернуть напоказ, держа за угол, измятый и нечистый платок. Бык Маллиган заботливо вытер лезвие. Вслед за этим, разглядывая платок, он объявил: Сморкальник барда. Новый оттенок в палитру ирландского стихотворца: сопливо-зеленый. Почти ощущаешь вкус, правда?Он снова поднялся к парапету и бросил долгий взгляд на залив. Ветерок шевелил белокурую, под светлый дуб, шевелюру. Господи!  сказал он негромко.  Как верно названо море у Элджи: седая нежная мать! Сопливо-зеленое море. Яйцещемящее море. Эпи ойнопа понтон.[]Ах, эти греки, Дедал. Надо мне тебя обучить. Ты должен прочесть их в подлиннике. Талатта! Талатта ![] Наша великая и нежная мать[]. Иди сюда и взгляни.Стивен встал и подошел к парапету. Перегнувшись, он посмотрел вниз на воду и на почтовый пароход, выходящий из гавани Кингстауна. Наша могущественная мать,  произнес Бык Маллиган.Внезапно он отвел взгляд от моря и большими пытливыми глазами посмотрел Стивену в лицо. Моя тетка считает, ты убил свою мать[],  сказал он.  Поэтому она бы мне вообще запретила с тобой встречаться. Кто-то ее убил,  сумрачно бросил Стивен. Черт побери, Клинк, уж на колени ты бы мог стать, если умирающая мать просит,  сказал Бык Маллиган.  Я сам гипербореец[] не хуже тебя. Но это ж подумать только, мать с последним вздохом умоляет стать на колени[], помолиться за нее  и ты отказываешься. Нет, что-то в тебе зловещее[]Оборвал себя и начал намыливать другую щеку. Всепрощающая улыбка тронула его губы. Но бесподобный комедиант!  шепнул он тихонько.  Клинк, бесподобнейший из комедиантов.Он брился плавно и осмотрительно, в истовом молчании.Стивен, поставив локоть на шершавый гранит, подперев лоб ладонью, неподвижно смотрел на обтерханные края своего черного лоснистого рукава. Боль, что не была еще болью любви, саднила сердце его. Во сне, безмолвно, она явилась ему после смерти, ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева, а дыхание, когда она с немым укором склонилась над ним, веяло сыростью могильного тлена. Поверх ветхой манжеты он видел море, которое сытый голос превозносил как великую и нежную мать. Кольцо залива и горизонта заполняла тускло-зеленая влага.Белый фарфоровый сосуд у ее смертного одра заполняла тягучая зеленая желчь, которую она с громкими стонами извергала из своей гниющей печени в приступах мучительной рвоты.Бык Маллиган заново обтер бритву. Эх, пес-бедолага!  с участием вздохнул он.  Надо бы выдать тебе рубашку да хоть пару сморкальников. А как те штаны, что купили с рук? Как будто впору,  отвечал Стивен.Бык Маллиган атаковал ложбинку под нижней губой. Смех да и только,  произнес он довольно.  Верней будет, с ног. Дознайся, какая там пьянь заразная таскала их. У меня есть отличная пара, серые, в узкую полоску. Ты бы в них выглядел потрясающе. Нет, кроме шуток, Клинк. Ты очень недурно смотришься, когда прилично одет. Спасибо,  ответил Стивен.  Если они серые, я их не могу носить[]. Он их не может носить,  сказал Бык Маллиган своему отражению в зеркале.  Этикет значит этикет. Он мать родную убил, но серые брюки ни за что не оденет.Он сложил аккуратно бритву и легкими касаньями пальцев ощупал гладкую кожу.Стивен перевел взгляд с залива на жирное лицо с мутно-голубыми бегающими глазами[]. Этот малый, с кем я сидел в Корабле прошлый вечер,  сказал Бык Маллиган,  уверяет, у тебя п.п.с. Он в желтом доме работает у Конопли Нормана. Прогрессивный паралич со слабоумием.Он описал зеркальцем полукруг, повсюду просверкав эту весть солнечными лучами, уже сияющими над морем. Изогнутые бритые губы, кончики блестящих белых зубов смеялись. Смех овладел всем его сильным и ладным телом. На, полюбуйся-ка на себя, горе-бард!  сказал он.Стивен наклонился и глянул в подставленное зеркало, расколотое кривой трещиной. Волосы дыбом. Так взор его и прочих видит меня[]. Кто мне выбрал это лицо? Эту паршивую шкуру пса-бедолаги? Оно тоже спрашивает меня. Я его стянул у служанки из комнаты,  поведал Бык Маллиган.  Ей в самый раз такое. Тетушка ради Мэйлахи всегда нанимает неказистых. Не введи его во искушение. И зовут-то Урсулой[].Снова залившись смехом, он убрал зеркальце из-под упорного взгляда Стивена. Ярость Калибана[], не видящего в зеркале своего отражения,  изрек он. Как жалко, Уайльд не дожил на тебя поглядеть!Отступив и показывая на зеркало, Стивен с горечью произнес: Вот символ ирландского искусства. Треснувшее зеркало служанки[].Неожиданно и порывисто Бык Маллиган подхватил Стивена под руку и зашагал с ним вокруг башни, позвякивая бритвой и зеркальцем, засунутыми в карман. Грех тебя так дразнить, правда, Клинк?  сказал он дружески.  Видит бог, в голове у тебя побольше, чем у них всех.Еще выпад отбит. Скальпель художника страшит его, как меня  докторский. Хладная сталь пера. Треснувшее зеркало служанки! Ты это скажи тому олуху из Оксфорда да вытяни из него гинею. Он весь провонял деньгами и считает, что ты не джентльмен. А у самого папаша набил мошну, сбывая негритосам слабительное, а может, еще на каких делишках. Эх, Клинк, если бы мы с тобой действовали сообща, уж мы бы кое-что сделали для нашего острова. Эллинизировали бы его.Рука Крэнли. Его рука[]. И подумать только, ты вынужден побираться у этих свиней. Я один-единственный понимаю, что ты за человек. Почему ж ты так мало мне доверяешь? Из-за чего все воротишь нос? Из-за Хейнса? Да пусть только пикнет, я притащу Сеймура, и мы ему закатим трепку еще похлеще, чем досталась Клайву Кемпторпу.Крики юных богатеньких голосов в квартире Клайва Кемпторпа. Бледнолицые: держатся за бока от хохота, хватаются друг за друга, ох, умора! Обри, бережно весть эту ей передай! Сейчас помру! В изрезанной рубашке, вьющейся лентами по воздуху, в съехавших до полу штанах, он, спотыкаясь, скачет вокруг стола, а за ним Эйдс из Магдалины с портновскими ножницами. Мордочка ошалелого теленка, позолоченная вареньем. Не надо, не сдирайте штаны! Не набрасывайтесь на меня, как бешеные[]!Крики из распахнутого окна вспугивают вечер во дворе колледжа. Глухой садовник в фартуке, замаскированный лицом Мэтью Арнольда, продвигается по темному газону с косилкой, вглядываясь в танцующий рой травинок.Нам самим новое язычество омфал.[] Ладно, пусть остается,  сказал Стивен.  Так-то он ничего, только по ночам. Тогда в чем же дело?  наседал Бык Маллиган.  Давай рожай. Я-то ведь напрямик с тобой. Что у тебя такое против меня?Они остановились, глядя туда, где тупая оконечность мыса Брэй-Хед покоилась на воде, словно голова спящего кита. Стивен осторожно высвободил руку. Ты хочешь, чтобы я сказал тебе?  спросил он. Да, в чем там дело?  повторил Бык Маллиган.  Я ничего не припоминаю.Говоря это, он в упор посмотрел на Стивена. Легкий ветерок пробежал по его лицу, вороша светлую спутанную шевелюру и зажигая в глазах серебряные искорки беспокойства.Стивен, удручаясь собственным голосом, сказал: Ты помнишь, как я пришел к тебе домой в первый раз после смерти матери?Бык Маллиган, мгновенно нахмурившись, отвечал: Как? Где? Убей, не могу припомнить. Я запоминаю только идеи и ощущения[]. Ну и что? Чего там стряслось, бога ради? Ты готовил чай,  продолжал Стивен,  а я пошел на кухню за кипятком. Из комнат вышла твоя мать и с ней кто-то из гостей. Она спросила, кто у тебя. Ну?  не отступал Бык Маллиган.  А я что сказал? Я уже все забыл. А ты сказал,  ответил Стивен ему,  Да так, просто Дедал, у которого мамаша подохла[].Бык Маллиган покраснел и стал казаться от этого моложе и привлекательней. Я так сказал?  переспросил он.  И что же? Что тут такого?Нервным движением он стряхнул свое замешательство. А что, по-твоему, смерть,  спросил он,  твоей матери, или твоя, или, положим, моя? Ты видел только, как умирает твоя мать. А я каждый день вижу, как они отдают концы и в Ричмонде, и в Скорбящей, да после их крошат на потроха в анатомичке. Это и называется подох, ничего больше. И не о чем говорить. Ты вот не соизволил стать на колени и помолиться за свою мать, когда она просила тебя на смертном одре. А почему? Да потому, что в тебе эта проклятая иезуитская закваска[], только она проявляется наоборот. По мне, тут одна падаль и пустая комедия. Ее лобные доли уже не действуют. Она называет доктора сэр Питер Тизл[] и хочет нарвать лютиков с одеяла. Уж не перечь ей, вот-вот все кончится. Ты сам не исполнил ее предсмертную просьбу, а теперь дуешься на меня, что я не скулил, как наемный плакальщик от Лалуэтта. Абсурд! Допустим, я и сказал так. Но я вовсе не хотел оскорбить память твоей матери.Его речь вернула ему самоуверенность. Стивен, скрывая зияющие раны, оставленные словами в его сердце, как можно суше сказал: Я и не говорю, что это оскорбляет мою мать. Так что же тогда?  спросил Бык Маллиган. Это оскорбляет меня,  был ответ.Бык Маллиган круто повернулся на каблуках. Нет, невозможный субъект!  воскликнул он.И пошел прочь быстрым шагом вдоль парапета. Стивен остался на месте, недвижно глядя на мыс и на спокойную гладь залива. Море и мыс сейчас подернулись дымкой. В висках стучала кровь, застилая взор, и он чувствовал, как лихорадочно горят его щеки.Громкий голос позвал снизу, из башни: Маллиган, вы где, наверху? Сейчас иду,  откликнулся Бык Маллиган.Он обернулся к Стивену и сказал: Взгляни на море. Что ему до всех оскорблений? Бросай-ка лучше Лойолу, Клинк, и двигаем вниз. Наш сакс поджидает уже свой бекон.Голова его задержалась на миг над лестницей, вровень с крышей. И не хандри из-за этого целый день. У меня же семь пятниц на неделе.Оставь скорбные думы.Голова скрылась, но мерный голос продолжал, опускаясь, доноситься из лестничного проема:Не прячь глаза и не скорбиНад горькой тайною любви,Там Фергус правит в полный рост,Владыка медных колесниц.[]В мирном спокойствии утра тени лесов неслышно проплывали от лестничного проема к морю, туда, куда он глядел. У берега и мористей водная гладь белела следами стремительных легких стоп. Морской волны белеет грудь.Попарные сплетения ударений. Рука, перебирающая струны арфы, рождает сплетения аккордов. Слитносплетенных словес словно волн белогрудых мерцанье.Облако медленно наползает на солнце, и гуще делается в тени зелень залива. Он был за спиной у него, сосуд горьких вод[]. Песня Фергуса. Я пел ее, оставшись дома один, приглушая долгие сумрачные аккорды. Дверь к ней была открыта: она хотела слышать меня. Безмолвно, с жалостью и благоговением, я приблизился к ее ложу. Она плакала на своем убогом одре. Над этими словами, Стивен: над горькой тайною любви.Где же теперь? Ее секреты в запертом ящичке: старые веера из перьев, бальные книжечки с бахромой, пропитанные мускусом, убор из янтарных бус. Когда она была девочкой, у ее окошка висела на солнце клетка с птицей. Она видела старика Ройса в представлении Свирепый турка и вместе со всеми смеялась, когда он распевал:Открою вам,Что рад бы самЯ невидимкой стать.Мимолетные радости, заботливо сложенные, надушенные мускусом.Не прячь глаза и не скорби.Сложены в памяти природы[], вместе с ее детскими игрушками. Скорбные воспоминания осаждают его разум. Стакан воды из крана на кухне, когда она собиралась к причастию. Яблоко с сахаром внутри, испеченное для нее на плите в темный осенний вечер. Ее изящные ногти, окрашенные кровью вшей с детских рубашонок.Во сне, безмолвно, она явилась ему, ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева, ее дыхание, когда она склонилась над ним с неслышными тайными словами, веяло сыростью могильного тлена[].Ее стекленеющие глаза уставились из глубин смерти, поколебать и сломить мою душу. На меня одного. Призрачная свеча освещает ее агонию. Призрачные блики на искаженном мукой лице. Громко раздается ее дыхание, хриплое, прерывающееся от ужаса, и, став на колени, все молятся. Взгляд ее на мне, повергнуть меня.      :     []; Упырь! Трупоед![]Нет, мать. Отпусти меня. Дай мне жить. Эгей, Клинк!Голос Быка Маллигана раздался певуче в глубине башни, приблизился, долетев от лестницы, позвал снова. Стивен, еще содрогаясь от вопля своей души, услышал теплый, щедрый солнечный свет и в воздухе за своей спиной дружеские слова. Будь паинькой, спускайся, Дедал. Завтрак готов. Хейнс извиняется за то, что мешал нам спать. Все улажено. Иду,  сказал Стивен, оборачиваясь. Давай, Христа ради,  говорил Маллиган.  И ради меня, и ради всеобщего блага.Его голова нырнула и вынырнула. Я ему передал про твой символ ирландского искусства. Говорит, очень остроумно. Вытяни из него фунт, идет? То бишь, гинею. Мне заплатят сегодня,  сказал Стивен. В школьной шарашке?  осведомился Маллиган.  А сколько? Четыре фунта? Одолжи нам один. Как угодно,  отвечал Стивен. Четыре сверкающих соверена!  вскричал с восторгом Бык Маллиган.  Устроим роскошный выпивон на зависть всем раздруидам. Четыре всемогущих соверена.Воздев руки, он затопал по каменным ступеням вниз, фальшиво распевая с лондонским простонародным акцентом:Веселье будет допоздна,Мы хлопнем виски и вина,В день КоронацииМы славно покутим!Веселье будет допоздна,И все мы покутим!Лучи солнца веселились над морем. Забытая никелевая чашка для бритья поблескивала на парапете. Почему я должен ее относить? Может, оставить тут на весь день, памятником забытой дружбе?Он подошел к ней, подержал с минуту в руках, осязая ее прохладу, чувствуя запах липкой пены с торчащим в ней помазком. Так прежде я носил кадило в Клонгоузе. Сейчас я другой и все-таки еще тот же. Опять слуга. Прислужник слуги[].В мрачном сводчатом помещении внутри башни фигура в халате бодро сновала у очага, то скрывая, то открывая желтое его пламя. Мягкий дневной свет падал двумя снопами через высокие оконца на вымощенный плитами пол, и там, где снопы встречались, плыло, медленно вращаясь, облако дыма от горящего угля и горелого жира. Этак мы задохнемся,  заметил Бык Маллиган.  Хейнс, вы не откроете дверь?Стивен поставил бритвенную чашку на шкафчик. Долговязый человек, сидевший на подвесной койке, направился к порогу и отворил внутреннюю дверь. А у вас есть ключ?  спросил голос. Ключ у Дедала,  отозвался Бык Маллиган.  Черти лохматые, я уже задыхаюсь!Не отрывая взгляда от очага, он взревел: Клинк! Ключ в скважине,  сказал Стивен, подходя ближе.Ключ с резким скрежетом дважды повернулся в замке, и тяжелая наружная дверь впустила долгожданные свет и воздух. Хейнс остановился в дверях, глядя наружу. Стивен придвинул к столу свой чемодан, поставив его торчком, и уселся ждать. Бык Маллиган шваркнул жарево на блюдо рядом с собой. Потом отнес блюдо и большой чайник к столу, поставил и вздохнул с облегчением. Ах, я вся таю,  произнес он,  как сказала свечка, когда Но  тес! Про это не будем. Клинк, проснись! Подавай хлеб, масло, мед. Присоединяйтесь, Хейнс. Кормежка готова. Благослови, Господи, нас и эти дары твои. Черт побери, молока нет!Стивен достал из шкафчика масленку, хлеб и горшочек с медом. Бык Маллиган, усевшись, вскипел внезапным негодованием. Что за бардак?  возмутился он.  Я ж ей сказал  прийти в начале девятого. Можно и без молока обойтись,  сказал Стивен.  В шкафчике есть лимон. Да пошел ты со своими парижскими замашками!  отвечал Бык Маллиган.  Я хочу молочка из Сэндикоува.Хейнс, направляясь к ним от дверей, сообщил: Идет ваша молочница с молоком. Благодать божия!  воскликнул Бык Маллиган, вскакивая со стула.  Присаживайтесь. Наливайте чай. Сахар в пакете. А с треклятой яичницей я больше не желаю возиться.Он кое как раскромсал жарево на блюде и раскидал его по трем тарелкам, приговаривая:        [].Хейнс сел и принялся разливать чай. Кладу всем по два куска,  сказал он.  Слушайте, Маллиган, какой вы крепкий завариваете!Бык Маллиган, нарезая хлеб щедрыми ломтями, замурлыкал умильным старушечьим голоском: Как надоть мне чай заваривать, уж я так заварю, говаривала матушка Гроган[]. А надоть нужду справлять, уж так справлю. Боже правый, вот это чай,  сказал Хейнс.Бык Маллиган, нарезая хлеб, так же умильно продолжал: Уж такой мой обычай, миссис Кахилл , это она говорит. А миссис Кахилл на это: Ахти, сударыня, только упаси вас Господи делать оба дела в одну посудину .На кончике ножа он протянул каждому из сотрапезников по толстому ломтю хлеба. Это же фольклор,  сказал он очень серьезно,  это для вашей книги, Хейнс. Пять строчек текста и десять страниц комментариев насчет фольклора и рыбообразных божеств Дандрама. Издано сестрами-колдуньями в год великого урагана[].Он обернулся к Стивену и, подняв брови, спросил его с крайней заинтересованностью: Не можете ли напомнить, коллега, где говорится про посудину матушки Гроган, в Мабиногионе[] или в упанишадах? Отнюдь не уверен,  солидно отвечал Стивен. В самом деле?  продолжал Бык Маллиган прежним тоном.  А отчего же, будьте любезны? Мне думается,  сказал Стивен, не прерывая еды,  этого не найти ни в Мабиногионе, ни за его пределами. Матушка Гроган, по всей вероятности, состоит в родстве с Мэри Энн.Бык Маллиган расплылся от удовольствия. Прелестно!  произнес он сюсюкающим и слащавым голосом, показывая белые зубы и жмурясь довольно.  Вы так полагаете? Совершенно прелестно!Затем, вдруг нарочито нахмурясь, он хрипло, скрипуче зарычал, рьяно нарезая новые ломти:На старуху Мэри ЭннЕй плевать с высоких стен,Но, задравши свой подолНабив рот яичницей, он жевал и мычал.В дверях, заслоняя свет, появилась фигура женщины. Молоко, сэр! Заходите, сударыня,  сказал Маллиган.  Клинк, подай-ка кувшин.Старушка вошла и остановилась около Стивена. Славное утречко, сэр,  сказала она.  Слава Богу. Кому-кому?  спросил Маллиган, поглядев на нее.  Ах да, конечно!Стивен, протянув руку за спину, достал из шкафчика молочный кувшин. Наши островитяне,  заметил Маллиган Хейнсу как бы вскользь,  нередко поминают сборщика крайней плоти[]. Сколько, сэр?  спросила старушка. Одну кварту,  ответил Стивен.Он смотрел, как она наливает в мерку, а оттуда в кувшин, густое белое молоко, не свое. Старые сморщенные груди. Она налила еще мерку с избытком.Древняя и таинственная, она явилась из утреннего мира, быть может, вестницей. Наливая молоко, она расхваливала его. В сочных лугах, чуть свет, она уже доила, сидя на корточках, ведьма на поганке, скрюченные пальцы проворны у набухшего вымени. Мычанием встречала ее привычный приход скотинка, шелковая от росы. Бедная старушка, шелковая коровка  такие прозвища давались ей в старину[]. Старуха-странница, низший род бессмертных, служащая своему захватчику и своему беззаботному обманщику, познавшая измену обоих, вестница тайны утра. Служить или укорять, он не знал; однако гнушался заискивать перед нею. И впрямь прекрасное, сударыня,  согласился Бык Маллиган, наливая им в чашки молоко. Вы, сэр, отведайте,  сказала она.Уступая ей, он сделал глоток. Если бы все мы могли питаться такой вот здоровой пищей,  объявил он звучно,  в этой стране не было бы столько гнилых зубов и гнилых кишок. А то живем в болоте, едим дешевую дрянь, а улицы вымощены навозом, пылью и чахоточными плевками. А вы, сэр, на доктора учитесь?  спросила старушка. Да, сударыня,  ответил Бык Маллиган.Стивен слушал, храня презрительное молчание. Она покорно внимает зычному голосу своего костоправа и врачевателя, меня она знать не знает.Голосу, который отпустит ей грехи и помажет для погребения ее тело, кроме женских нечистых чресл, сотворенное из плоти мужской не по подобию Божию, в добычу змею. И тому голосу, что сейчас заставляет ее умолкнуть, с удивлением озираясь. Вы понимаете, что он говорит?  осведомился у нее Стивен. Это вы по-французски, сэр?  спросила старушка Хейнса.Хейнс с апломбом обратил к ней новую тираду, еще длинней. Это по-ирландски,  объяснил Бык Маллиган.  Вы гэльский знаете? Я так и думала по звуку, это ирландский,  сказала она.  А вы не с запада, сэр[]? Я англичанин,  ответил Хейнс. Он англичанин,  повторил Бык Маллиган,  и он считает, в Ирландии надо говорить по-ирландски. Нет спору, надо,  сказала старушка,  мне и самой стыд, что не умею на нашем языке. А люди умные говорят, язык-то великий. Великий  это не то слово,  заявил Бык Маллиган.  Он абсолютно великолепен. Плесни нам еще чайку, Клинк. Не хотите ли чашечку, сударыня? Нет, сэр, спасибо,  отвечала старушка, повесив на руку бидон и собираясь идти.Хейнс обратился к ней: А счет у вас есть? Маллиган, надо бы заплатить, верно?Стивен снова наполнил чашки. Счет, сэр?  неуверенно переспросила она.  Это значит, семь дней по пинте по два пенса это семь раз по два это шиллинг два пенса да эти три дня по кварте по четыре пенса будет три кварты это выходит шиллинг да там один и два всего два и два, сэр.Бык Маллиган вздохнул и, отправив в рот горбушку, густо намазанную маслом с обеих сторон, вытянул вперед ноги и начал рыться в карманах. Платить подобает с любезным видом,  сказал улыбаясь Хейнс.Стивен налил третью чашку, слегка закрасив ложечкой чая густое жирное молоко. Бык Маллиган выудил из кармана флорин и, повертев его в пальцах, воскликнул: О, чудо!Он пододвинул флорин по столу к старушке, приговаривая: Радость моя, для тебя все, что имею, отдам[].Стивен вложил монету в ее нежадную руку. За нами еще два пенса,  заметил он. Это не к спеху, сэр,  уверяла она, убирая монету.  Совсем не к спеху. Всего вам доброго, сэр.Поклонившись, она ушла, напутствуемая нежным речитативом Быка Маллигана: Я бы с восторгом весь мирК милым повергнул стопам.Он обернулся к Стивену и сказал: Серьезно, Дедал. Я совсем на мели. Беги в свою школьную шарашку да принеси оттуда малость деньжонок. Сегодня бардам положено пить и пировать. Ирландия ожидает, что в этот день каждый выполнит свой долг[]. Что до меня,  заметил Хейнс, поднимаясь,  то я должен сегодня посетить вашу национальную библиотеку. Сперва поплавать,  заявил Бык Маллиган.Он обернулся к Стивену и самым учтивым тоном спросил: Не сегодня ли, Клинк, день твоего ежемесячного омовения?И пояснил, обращаясь к Хейнсу: Оный нечистый бард имеет правило мыться один раз в месяц. Всю Ирландию омывает Гольфстрим,  промолвил Стивен, поливая хлеб струйкой меда.Хейнс отозвался из угла, легким узлом повязывая шейный платок под открытым воротом спортивной рубашки: Я буду собирать ваши изречения, если вы позволите.Обращено ко мне. Они моются, банятся, оттираются. Жагала сраму[]. Совесть. А пятно все на месте[]. Это отлично сказано, что треснувшее зеркало служанки  символ ирландского искусства.Бык Маллиган, толкнув Стивена ногой под столом, задушевно пообещал: Погодите, Хейнс, вот вы еще послушаете его о Гамлете. Нет, я в самом деле намерен,  продолжал Хейнс, обращаясь к Стивену.  Я как раз думал на эту тему, когда пришло это ветхое создание. А я что-нибудь заработаю на этом?  спросил Стивен.Хейнс рассмеялся и сказал, снимая мягкую серую шляпу с крюка, на котором была подвешена койка: Чего не знаю, того не знаю.Неторопливо он направился к двери. Бык Маллиган перегнулся к Стивену и грубо, с нажимом прошипел: Не можешь без своих штучек. Для чего ты это ему? А что?  возразил Стивен.  Задача  раздобыть денег. У кого? У него или у молочницы. По-моему, орел или решка. Я про тебя ему уши прожужжал,  не отставал Бык Маллиган,  а тут извольте, ты со своим вшивым злопамятством да замогильными иезуитскими шуточками. У меня нет особой надежды,  заметил Стивен,  как на него, так и на нее.Бык Маллиган трагически вздохнул и положил руку Стивену на плечо. Лишь на меня, Клинк,  произнес он.И совсем другим голосом добавил: Честно признаться, я и сам считаю, ты прав. На хрена они, кроме этого, сдались. Чего ты их не морочишь, как я? Пошли они все к ляду. Надо выбираться из этого бардака.Он встал, важно распустил пояс и совлек с себя свой халат, произнося отрешенным тоном: И был Маллиган разоблачен от одежд его[].Содержимое карманов он выложил на стол со словами: Вот тебе твой соплюшник.И, надевая жесткий воротничок и строптивый галстук, стыдил их и укорял, а с ними и запутавшуюся часовую цепочку. Руки его, нырнув в чемодан, шарили там, покуда он требовал себе чистый носовой платок. Жагала сраму. Клянусь богом, мы же обязаны поддерживать репутацию. Желаю бордовые перчатки и зеленые башмаки. Противоречие. Я противоречу себе[]? Ну что же, значит, я противоречу себе. Ветреник Малахия. Его говорливые руки метнули мягкий черный снаряд. И вот твоя шляпа, в стиле Латинского Квартала.Стивен поймал ее и надел на голову. Хейнс окликнул их от дверей: Друзья, вы двигаетесь? Я готов,  отозвался Бык Маллиган, идя к двери.  Пошли, Клинк. Кажется, ты уже все доел после нас.Отрешенный и важный, проследовал он к порогу, не без прискорбия сообщая: И, пойдя вон, плюхнулся с горки.Стивен, взяв ясеневую тросточку, стоявшую у стены, тронулся за ним следом. Выйдя на лестницу, он притянул неподатливую стальную дверь и запер ее. Гигантский ключ сунул во внутренний карман.У подножия лестницы Бык Маллиган спросил: А ты ключ взял? Да, он у меня,  отвечал Стивен, перегоняя их.Он шел вперед. За спиной у себя он слышал, как Бык Маллиган сбивает тяжелым купальным полотенцем верхушки папоротников или трав. Кланяйтесь, сэр. Да как вы смеете, сэр.Хейнс спросил: А вы платите аренду за башню? Двенадцать фунтов,  ответил Бык Маллиган. Военному министру,  добавил Стивен через плечо.Они приостановились, покуда Хейнс разглядывал башню. Потом он заметил: Зимой унылое зрелище, надо думать. Как она называется, Мартелло? Их выстроили по указанию Билли Питта[],  сказал Бык Маллиган,  когда с моря угрожали французы. Но наша  это омфал. И какие же у вас идеи о Гамлете?  спросил у Стивена Хейнс. О нет!  воскликнул страдальчески Бык Маллиган.  Я этого не выдержу, я вам не Фома Аквинат, измысливший пятьдесят пять причин. Дайте мне сперва принять пару кружек.Он обернулся к Стивену, аккуратно одергивая лимонный жилет: Тебе ж самому для такого надо не меньше трех, правда, Клинк? Это уж столько ждет,  ответил тот равнодушно,  может и еще подождать. Вы разжигаете мое любопытство,  любезно заметил Хейнс.  Тут какой-нибудь парадокс? Фу!  сказал Маллиган.  Мы уже переросли Уайльда и парадоксы. Все очень просто. Он с помощью алгебры доказывает, что внук Гамлета  дедушка Шекспира, а сам он призрак собственного отца. Как-как?  переспросил Хейнс, показывая было на Стивена.  Вот он сам?Бык Маллиган накинул полотенце на шею наподобие столы патера и, корчась от смеха, шепнул на ухо Стивену: О, тень Клинка-старшего! Иафет в поисках отца[]! Мы по утрам усталые,  сказал Стивен Хейнсу.  А это довольно долго рассказывать.Бык Маллиган, снова зашагавший вперед, воздел руки к небу. Только священная кружка способна развязать Дедалу язык,  объявил он. Я хочу сказать,  Хейнс принялся объяснять Стивену на ходу,  эта башня и эти скалы мне чем-то напоминают Эльсинор. Выступ утеса[] грозного, нависшего над морем, не так ли?Бык Маллиган на миг неожиданно обернулся к Стивену, но ничего не сказал. В этот сверкнувший безмолвный миг Стивен словно увидел свой облик, в пыльном дешевом трауре, рядом с их яркими одеяниями. Это удивительная история,  сказал Хейнс, опять останавливая их.Глаза, светлые, как море под свежим ветром, еще светлей, твердые и сторожкие. Правитель морей, он смотрел на юг, через пустынный залив, где лишь маячил смутно на горизонте дымный плюмаж далекого пакетбота да парусник лавировал у банки Маглине. Я где-то читал богословское истолкование,  произнес он в задумчивости.  Идея Отца и Сына. Сын, стремящийся к воссоединению с Отцом.Бык Маллиган немедля изобразил ликующую физиономию с ухмылкою до ушей.Он поглядел на них, блаженно разинув красивый рот, и глаза его, в которых он тут же пригасил всякую мысль, моргали с полоумным весельем. Он помотал туда-сюда болтающейся башкой болванчика, тряся полями круглой панамы, и запел дурашливым, бездумно веселым голосом:Я юноша странный, каких поискать[],Отец мой был птицей, еврейкою  мать.С Иосифом-плотником жить я не стал.Бродяжничал и на Голгофу попал.Он предостерегающе поднял палец:А кто говорит, я не бог, тем плутамВинца, что творю из воды, я не дам.Пусть пьют они воду, и тайна ясна,Как снова я воду творю из вина.Быстрым прощальным жестом он подергал за Стивенову тросточку и устремился вперед, к самому краю утеса, хлопая себя по бокам, как будто плавниками или крыльями, готовящимися взлететь, и продолжая свое пение:Прощай же и речи мои запиши,О том, что воскрес я, везде расскажи.Мне плоть не помеха, коль скоро я бог,Лечу я на небо Прощай же, дружок!Выделывая антраша, он подвигался на их глазах к сорокафутовому провалу, махая крылоподобными руками, легко подскакивая, и шляпа ветреника колыхалась на свежем ветру, доносившем до них его отрывистые птичьи крики.Хейнс, который посмеивался весьма сдержанно, идя рядом со Стивеном, заметил: Мне кажется, тут не стоит смеяться. Он сильно богохульствует. Впрочем, я лично не из верующих. С другой стороны, его веселье как-то придает всему безобидность, не правда ли? Как это у него называется? Иосиф-плотник? Баллада об Иисусе-шутнике,  буркнул Стивен. Так вы это раньше слышали?  спросил Хейнс. Каждый день три раза, после еды,  последовал сухой ответ. Но вы сами-то не из верующих?  продолжал расспрашивать Хейнс.  Я хочу сказать: верующих в узком смысле слова. Творение из ничего, чудеса, Бог как личность. Мне думается, у этого слова всего один смысл,  сказал Стивен.Остановясь, Хейнс вынул серебряный портсигар с мерцающим зеленым камнем. Нажав на пружину крышки большим пальцем, он раскрыл его и протянул Стивену. Спасибо,  отозвался тот, беря сигарету.Хейнс взял другую себе и снова защелкнул крышку. Спрятав обратно портсигар, он вынул из жилетного кармана никелированную трутницу, тем же манером раскрыл ее, прикурил и, заслонив язычок пламени ладонью, подставил Стивену. Да, конечно,  проговорил он, когда они пошли дальше.  Вы либо веруете, либо нет, верно? Лично я не мог бы переварить идею личного Бога. Надеюсь, вы ее не придерживаетесь? Вы видите во мне,  произнес Стивен мрачно и недовольно,  пример ужасающего вольнодумства.Он шел, выжидая продолжения разговора, держа сбоку ясеневую тросточку.Ее кованый наконечник легко чертил по тропинке, поскрипывая у ног. Мой дружочек следом за мной, с тоненьким зовом: Стииииии-вии! Волнистая линия вдоль тропинки. Они пройдут по ней вечером, затемно возвращаясь. Он хочет ключ. Ключ мой, я плачу аренду. Но я ем хлеб его, что горестен устам[].Отдай и ключ. Все отдай. Он спросит про него. По глазам было видно. В конечном счете  начал Хейнс.Стивен обернулся и увидал, что холодный взгляд, смеривший его, был не таким уж недобрым. В конечном счете, мне кажется, вы способны достичь свободы. Похоже, что вы сами себе господин. Я слуга двух господ,  отвечал Стивен,  или, если хотите, госпож, англичанки и итальянки. Итальянки?  переспросил Хейнс.Полоумная королева, старая и ревнивая. На колени передо мной. А некто третий,  продолжал Стивен,  желает, чтобы я был у него на побегушках. Итальянки?  спросил снова Хейнс.  Что это значит? Британской империи,  пояснил Стивен, покраснев,  и Римской святой соборной и апостольской церкви.Прежде чем заговорить, Хейнс снял с нижней губы приставшие крошки табака. Вполне понимаю вас,  спокойно заметил он.  Я бы даже сказал, для ирландца естественно так думать. Мы в Англии сознаем, что обращались с вами несправедливо. Но повинна тут, видимо, история.Гордые полновластные титулы прозвучали в памяти Стивена победным звоном медных колоколов:       [] неспешный рост, вызревание догматов и обрядов, как его собственных заветных мыслей, химия звезд. Апостольский символ[] в мессе папы Марцеллия[], голоса сливаются в мощное утверждающее соло, и под их пение недреманный ангел церкви воинствующей обезоруживал ересиархов и грозил им.Орды ересей в скособоченных митрах разбегаются наутек: Фотий, орава зубоскалов, средь коих и Маллиган, Арий, воевавший всю жизнь против единосущия Сына Отцу, Валентин, что гнушался земным естеством Христа, и хитроумный ересиарх из Африки, Савеллий, по чьим утверждениям Отец Сам был собственным Сыном[].Слова, которые только что сказал Маллиган, зубоскаля над чужеземцем.Пустое зубоскальство. Неизбежная пустота ожидает их, всех, что ткут ветер[]: угрозу, обезоруживанье и поражение несут им стройные боевые порядки ангелов церкви, воинство Михаила[], в пору раздоров всегда встающее на ее защиту с копьями и щитами.Браво, бис! Продолжительные аплодисменты. !   ![] Я, разумеется, британец,  продолжал голос Хейнса,  и мыслю я соответственно. К тому же мне вовсе не хочется увидеть свою страну в руках немецких евреев. Боюсь, что сейчас это главная опасность для нашей нации.Двое, наблюдая, стояли на краю обрыва  делец и лодочник. Плывет в Баллок.Лодочник с неким пренебрежением кивнул на север залива. Там будет саженей пять[],  сказал он.  Туда его и вынесет после часу, когда прилив начнется. Нынче девятый день.Про утопленника. Парус кружит по пустынной бухте, поджидая, когда вынырнет раздутый мешок и обернет к солнцу солью беленное вспученное лицо.А вот и я.Извилистой тропкой они спустились к неширокому заливчику. Бык Маллиган стоял на камне без пиджака, отшпиленный галстук струился по ветру за плечом. Поблизости от него юноша, держась за выступ скалы, медленно по-лягушачьи разводил зелеными ногами в студенистой толще воды. А брат с тобой, Мэйлахи? Да нет, он в Уэстмите, у Бэннонов. Все еще? Мне Бэннон прислал открытку. Говорит, подцепил себе там одну молоденькую. Фотодевочка, он ее так зовет. Заснял, значит? С короткой выдержкой?Бык Маллиган уселся снять башмаки. Из-за выступа скалы высунулось красное отдувающееся лицо. Пожилой мужчина вылез на камни, вода блестела на его лысине с седоватым венчиком, вода струилась по груди, по брюху, капала с черных мешковатых трусов.Бык Маллиган посторонился, пропуская его, и, бросив взгляд на Хейнса и Стивена, ногтем большого пальца[] набожно перекрестил себе лоб, уста и грудную клетку. А Сеймур опять в городе,  сказал юноша, ухватившись снова за выступ.  Медицину побоку, решил в армию. Да иди ты,  хмыкнул Бык Маллиган. На той неделе уже в казарму. А ты знаешь ту рыженькую из Карлайла, Лили? Знаю. Прошлый вечер на пирсе с ним обжималась. У папаши денег до черта. Может, она залетела? Это ты Сеймура спроси. Сеймур  кровопускающий офицер!  объявил Бык Маллиган.Кивнув самому себе, он стянул с ног брюки, выпрямился и изрек избитую истину: Рыжие бабы блудливы как козы.Встревоженно оборвав, принялся щупать свои бока под вздувшейся от ветра рубашкой. У меня нет двенадцатого ребра[],  возопил он.  Я []. Беззубый Клинк и я, мы сверхчеловеки.Он выпутался из рубашки и кинул ее к вороху остальной одежды. Здесь залезаешь, Мэйлахи? Ага. Дай-ка местечко на кровати.Юноша в воде оттолкнулся назад и в два сильных, ровных гребка выплыл на середину заливчика. Хейнс с сигаретой присел на камень. А вы не будете?  спросил Бык Маллиган. Попозже,  отвечал Хейнс.  После завтрака не сразу.Стивен повернулся идти. Я ухожу, Маллиган,  сказал он. А дай-ка тот ключ, Клинк,  сказал Бык Маллиган,  мою рубашку прижать.Стивен протянул ему ключ. Бык Маллиган положил его на ворох одежды. И двухпенсовик на пинту. Кидай туда же.Стивен кинул два пенса на мягкий ворох. Одеваются, раздеваются. Бык Маллиган, выпрямившись, сложив перед грудью руки, торжественно произнес: Крадущий у бедного дает взаймы Господу[]. Так говорил Заратустра.Жирное тело нырнуло в воду. Еще увидимся,  сказал Хейнс, повернувшись к уходящему Стивену и улыбаясь необузданности ирландцев.Бычьих рогов, конских копыт и улыбки сакса[]. В Корабле!  крикнул Бык Маллиган.  В полпервого. Ладно,  ответил Стивен.Он шел по тропинке, что вилась вверх.  .  .Седой нимб священника за скалой, куда тот скромно удалился для одевания. Сегодня я не буду здесь ночевать. Домой идти тоже не могу.Зов, протяжный и мелодичный, донесся до него с моря. На повороте тропинки он помахал рукой. Голос донесся снова. Лоснящаяся темная голова, тюленья, далеко от берега, круглая.Захватчик.Эпизод [] Кокрейн, ты скажи. Какой город послал за ним? Тарент, сэр. Правильно. А потом? Потом было сражение, сэр. Правильно. А где?Мальчуган с пустым выражением уставился в пустоту окна.Басни дочерей памяти. Но ведь чем -то и непохоже на басни памяти. Тогда  фраза, сказанная в сердцах, шум Блейковых крыл избытка[]. Слышу, как рушатся пространства, обращаются в осколки стекло и камень, и время охвачено сине-багровым пламенем конца. Что же нам остается? Я позабыл место, сэр. В  году до нашей эры. Аскулум,  бросил Стивен, заглянув в книгу с рубцами кровопролитий. Да, сэр. И он сказал: еще одна такая победа  и мы погибли[].Вот эту фразу мир и запомнил. Утеха для скудоумных. Над усеянной телами равниной, опершись на копье, генерал обращается с холма к офицерам. Любой генерал к любым офицерам. А те внимают. Теперь ты, Армстронг,  сказал Стивен.  А каков был конец Пирра? Конец Пирра, сэр? Я знаю, сэр. Спросите меня, сэр,  вызвался Комин. Нет, ты обожди. Армстронг. Ты что-нибудь знаешь о Пирре?В ранце у Армстронга уютно притаился кулек с вялеными фигами. Время от времени он разминал их в ладонях и отправлял потихоньку в рот. Крошки, приставшие к кожице на губах. Подслащенное мальчишеское дыхание.Зажиточная семья, гордятся, что старший сын во флоте. Викс-роуд, Долки. О Пирре, сэр? Пирр  это пирс.Все засмеялись. Визгливый, злорадный смех без веселья. Армстронг обвел взглядом класс, дурашливая ухмылка на профиле. Сейчас совсем разойдутся, знают, что мне их не приструнить, а плату их папаши внесли. Тогда объясни,  сказал Стивен, касаясь плеча мальчугана книжкой,  что это такое, пирс. Ну, пирс, сэр,  тянул Армстронг.  Такая штука над морем. Вроде как мост. В Кингстауне пирс, сэр.Кое кто засмеялся снова, без веселья, но со значением. Двое на задней парте начали перешептываться. Да. Они знали: никогда не изведав, никогда не были невинны. Все. Он с завистью оглядел их лица. Эдит, Этель, Герти, Лили. Похожи на этих: дыхание тоже подслащенное от чая с вареньем, браслеты звякают во время возни. Кингстаунский пирс,  повторил Стивен.  Да, несбывшийся мост.Их взгляды смутились от его слов. Как это, сэр?  спросил Комин.  Мост, он же через реку.Хейнсу в его цитатник. Не для этих ушей. Вечером, среди пьянки и пустословия, пронзить, словно пирс воду, ровную гладь его ума. А что в том? Шут при господском дворе, благоволимый и презираемый, добился от господина милостивой похвалы. Почему все они выбрали эту роль? Не только ведь ради ласки и поощрения. Для них тоже история  это сказка, давно навязшая в ушах, а своя страна  закладная лавка[].Разве Пирр не пал в Аргосе от руки старой ведьмы[], а Юлия Цезаря не закололи кинжалом? Их уже не изгнать из памяти. Время поставило на них свою мету[] и заключило, сковав, в пространстве, что занимали уничтоженные ими бесчисленные возможности. Но были ль они возможны, если их так и не было? Или то лишь было возможным, что состоялось? Тките, ветра ткачи. Сэр, а расскажите нам что-нибудь. Ага, сэр, про привидения. Где мы остановились тут?  спросил Стивен, открывая другую книгу. "Оставь рыданья"[],  сказал Комин. Ну, давай, Толбот. А историю, сэр? Потом,  сказал Стивен.  Давай, Толбот.Смуглый мальчуган раскрыл книгу и ловко приладил ее за укрытием своего ранца. Он начал читать стихотворение, запинаясь и часто подглядывая в текст:Оставь рыданья, о пастух, оставь рыданья,Ликид не умирал, напрасна скорбь твоя,Хотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертаньяТогда это должно быть движением, актуализация возможного как такового.Фраза Аристотеля сложилась из бормотанья ученика и поплыла вдаль, в ученую тишину[] библиотеки Святой Женевьевы, где он читал, огражден от греховного Парижа, вечер за вечером. Рядом хрупкий сиамец штудировал учебник стратегии. Вокруг меня насыщенные и насыщающиеся мозги  пришпиленные под лампочками, слабо подрагивающие щупиками,  а во тьме моего ума грузное подземное чудище, неповоротливое, боящееся света, шевелит драконовой чешуей. Мысль  это мысль о мысли. Безмятежная ясность. Душа  это, неким образом, все сущее: душа  форма форм[]. Безмятежность нежданная, необъятная, лучащаяся: форма форм.Толбот твердил:И дивной властию того,кто шел по водам,И дивной властию Можешь перевернуть,  сказал Стивен безразлично.  Я ничего не вижу. Чего, сэр?  спросил простодушно Толбот, подаваясь вперед.Его рука перевернула страницу. Он снова выпрямился и продолжал, как будто припомнив. О том, кто шел по водам. И здесь лежит его тень, на этих малодушных сердцах, и на сердце безбожника, на его устах, на моих. Она и на снедаемых любопытством лицах тех, что предложили ему динарий[]. Кесарево кесарю, а Божие Богу. Долгий взгляд темных глаз, загадочные слова, что без конца будут ткаться на кроснах церкви. Да.Отгадай загадку, будешь молодец:Зернышки посеять мне велел отец.Толбот закрыл книжку и сунул ее в ранец. Все уже?  спросил Стивен. Да, сэр. В десять хоккей, сэр. Короткий день, сэр. Четверг. А кто отгадает загадку?  спросил Стивен.Они распихивали учебники, падали карандаши, шуршали страницы.Сгрудившись вместе, защелкивали и затягивали ранцы, разом весело тараторя: Загадку, сэр? Давайте я, сэр. Я, дайте я, сэр. Какую потрудней, сэр. Загадка такая,  сказал Стивен.Кочет поет.Чист небосвод.Колокол в небеОдиннадцать бьет.Бедной душе на небесаЧас улетать настает[]. Отгадайте, что это. Чего -чего, сэр? Еще разок, сэр. Мы не расслышали.Глаза их расширились, когда он повторил строчки. Настала пауза, а потом Кокрейн попросил: Скажите отгадку, сэр. Мы сдаемся.Стивен, чувствуя подкативший к горлу комок, ответил: Это лис хоронит свою бабку под остролистом.Нервически рассмеявшись, он встал, и эхом ему нестройно раздались их возгласы разочарования.В дверь стукнули клюшкой, и голос из коридора прокричал: Хоккей!Они кинулись как оголтелые, боком выскакивая из -за парт, перемахивая через сиденья. Вмиг комната опустела, и из раздевалки послышался их гомон и грохот клюшек и башмаков.Сарджент, единственный, кто остался, медленно подошел, протягивая раскрытую тетрадь. Его спутанные волосы и тощая шея выдавали явную неготовность, слабые глаза в запотевших очках глядели просяще. На блеклой бескровной щеке расплылось чернильное пятно в форме финика, еще свежее и влажное, как след слизня.Он подал тетрадку. Наверху страницы было выведено: Примеры. Дальше шли цифры вкривь и вкось, а внизу имелся корявый росчерк с загогулинами и с кляксой. Сирил Сарджент: личная подпись и печать. Мистер Дизи велел все снова переписать и показать вам, сэр.Стивен потрогал края тетрадки. Что толку. Ты уже понял, как их решать?  спросил он. С одиннадцатого до пятнадцатого,  отвечал Сарджент.  Мистер Дизи сказал, надо было списать с доски, сэр. А сам теперь сможешь сделать? Нет, сэр.Уродлив и бестолков: худая шея, спутанные волосы, пятно на щеке  след слизня. Но ведь какая-то любила его, выносила под сердцем, нянчила на руках. Если бы не она, мир в своей гонке давно подмял бы его, растоптал, словно бескостого слизня. А она любила его жидкую слабосильную кровь, взятую у нее самой. Значит, это и есть настоящее[]? Единственно истинное в жизни? В святом своем рвении пламенный Колумбан[] перешагнул через тело матери, простершейся перед ним. Ее не стало: дрожащий остов ветки, попаленной огнем, запах розового дерева и могильного тлена. Она спасла его, не дала растоптать и ушла, почти не коснувшись бытия. Бедная душа улетела на небеса  и на вересковой пустоши, под мерцающими звездами, лис, горящие беспощадные глаза, рыжим и хищным духом разит от шкуры, рыл землю, вслушивался, откидывал землю, вслушивался и рыл, рыл.Сидя с ним рядом, Стивен решал задачу. Он с помощью алгебры доказывает, что призрак Шекспира  это дедушка Гамлета. Сарджент глядел искоса через съехавшие очки. Из раздевалки стук клюшек; с поля голоса и глухие удары по мячу.Значки на странице изображали чопорный мавританский танец, маскарад букв в причудливых шляпах квадратов и кубов. Подача руки, поворот, поклон партнеру: вот так: бесовские измышленья мавров. И они уже покинули мир, Аверроэс и Моисей Маймонид, мужи, темные обличьем и обхожденьем, ловящие в свои глумливые зеркала смутную душу мира, и тьма в свете светит, и свет не объемлет ее[]. Ну как, понял? Сможешь сам сделать следующий? Да, сэр.Вялыми, неуверенными движениями пера Сарджент списал условие. То и дело медля в надежде помощи, рука его старательно выводила кривые значки, слабая краска стыда проступала сквозь блеклую кожу щек.  [], родительный субъекта и объекта. Она вскормила его своей жидкой кровью и свернувшимся молоком, скрывала от чужих взоров его пеленки.Я был как он, те же косые плечи, та же нескладность Детство мое, сгорбясь подле меня. Ушло, и не коснуться его, пускай хоть раз, хоть слегка. Мое ушло, а его потаенно, как наши взгляды. Тайны, безмолвно застывшие в темных чертогах двух наших сердец: тайны, уставшие тиранствовать: тираны, мечтающие быть свергнутыми.Пример был решен. Вот видишь, как просто,  сказал Стивен, вставая. Ага, сэр, спасибо,  ответил Сарджент.Он промокнул страницу и отнес тетрадь к парте. Бери свою клюшку и ступай к ребятам,  сказал Стивен, направляясь к дверям следом за нескладной фигуркой. Ага, сэр.В коридоре послышалось его имя, его окликали с поля: Сарджент! Беги, мистер Дизи тебя зовет,  поторопил Стивен.Стоя на крыльце, он глядел, как пентюх поспешает на поле битвы, где голоса затеяли крикливую перебранку. Их разделили на команды, и мистер Дизи возвращался, шагая через метелки травы затянутыми в гетры ногами.Едва он дошел до школы, как снова заспорившие голоса позвали его назад. Он обернул к ним сердитые седые усы. Ну что еще?  прокричал он несколько раз, не слушая. Кокрейн и Холлидей в одной команде, сэр,  крикнул ему Стивен. Вы не обождете минутку у меня в кабинете,  попросил мистер Дизи,  пока я тут наведу порядок.Он озабоченно зашагал по полю обратно, строго покрикивая своим старческим голосом: В чем дело? Что там еще?Пронзительные их крики взметнулись разом со всех сторон от него; фигурки их обступили его кольцом, а слепящее солнце выбеливало мед его плохо выкрашенной головы.Прокуренный застоялый дух царил в кабинете, вместе с запахом кожи вытертых тускло-желтых кресел. Как в первый день, когда мы с ним рядились тут. Как было вначале, так и ныне. Сбоку стоял подносик с монетами Стюарта[], жалкое сокровище ирландских болот: и присно. И в футляре для ложек, на выцветшем алом плюше, двенадцать апостолов[], проповедовавших всем языкам: и во веки веков.Торопливые шаги по каменному крыльцу, в коридоре. Раздувая редкие свои усы, мистер Дизи остановился у стола. Сначала наши небольшие расчеты.Он вынул из сюртука перетянутый кожаной ленточкой бумажник. Раскрыв его, извлек две банкноты, одну  из склеенных половинок, и бережно положил на стол. Два,  сказал он, вновь перетягивая и убирая бумажник.Теперь в хранилище золотых запасов. Ладонь Стивена в неловкости блуждала по раковинам, лежавшим грудой в холодной каменной ступке: волнистые рожки, и каури, и багрянки, а эта вот закручена, как тюрбан эмира, а эта  гребешок святого Иакова. Добро старого пилигрима, мертвые сокровища, пустые ракушки.Соверен, новенький и блестящий, упал на мягкий ворс скатерти. Три,  сказал мистер Дизи, вертя в руках свою маленькую копилку.  Очень удобная штучка.  Смотрите. Вот сюда соверены. Тут шиллинги, полукроны, шестипенсовики. А сюда  кроны. Смотрите.Он высыпал на ладонь два шиллинга и две кроны. Три двенадцать,  сказал он.  По -моему, это правильно. Благодарю вас, сэр,  отвечал Стивен, с застенчивою поспешностью собирая деньги и пряча их в карман брюк. Не за что,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вы это заработали.Рука Стивена, освободившись, вернулась снова к пустым ракушкам. Тоже символы красоты и власти. Толика денег в моем кармане: символы, запятнанные алчностью и нищетой. Не надо их так носить,  предостерег мистер Дизи.  Где-нибудь вытащите и потеряете. Купите лучше такую же штуковину. Увидите, как это удобно.Отвечай что-нибудь. У меня она часто будет пустовать.Те же место и час, та же премудрость: и я тот же. Вот уже трижды. Три петли вокруг меня. Ладно. Я их могу разорвать в любой миг, если захочу. Потому что вы не откладываете,  мистер Дизи поднял вверх палец.  Вы еще не знаете, что такое деньги. Деньги  это власть. Вот поживете с мое. Уж я -то знаю. Если бы молодость знала. Как это там у Шекспира? Набей потуже кошелек. Яго,  пробормотал Стивен.Он поднял взгляд от праздных ракушек к глазам старого джентльмена. Он знал, что такое деньги,  продолжал мистер Дизи,  он их наживал. Поэт, но в то же время и англичанин. А знаете, чем англичане гордятся? Какие самые гордые слова у англичанина?Правитель морей. Холодные как море глаза смотрели на пустынную бухту -повинна история  на меня и мои слова, без ненависти. Что над его империей никогда не заходит солнце. Ха!  воскликнул мистер Дизи.  Это совсем не англичанин. Это сказал французский кельт[].Он постукал своей копилкой о ноготь большого пальца. Я вам скажу,  объявил он торжественно,  чем он больше всего хвастает и гордится: Я никому не должен.Надо же, какой молодец. "Я никому не должен. Я за всю жизнь не занял ни у кого ни шиллинга". Вам понятно такое чувство? У меня нет долгов. Понятно?Маллигану девять фунтов, три пары носков, пару обуви, галстуки. Каррэну десять гиней. Макканну гинею. Фреду Райену два шиллинга. Темплу за два обеда. Расселу гинею, Казинсу десять шиллингов, Бобу Рейнольдсу полгинеи, Келеру три гинеи, миссис Маккернан за комнату, пять недель. Малая моя толика бессильна[]. В данный момент нет,  ответил Стивен.Мистер Дизи от души рассмеялся, пряча свою копилку. Я так и думал,  сказал он весело.  Но когда-нибудь вам придется к нему прийти. Мы народ щедрый, но справедливость тоже нужна. Я боюсь этих громких слов,  сказал Стивен,  они нам приносят столько несчастий[].Мистер Дизи вперил суровый взгляд туда, где над камином пребывали дородные стати мужчины в клетчатом килте: Альберт Эдуард, принц Уэльский. Вы меня считаете старым замшелым тори,  молвил его задумчивый голос.  Со времен ОКоннелла я видел три поколения[]. Я помню голод. А вы знаете, что ложи оранжистов вели агитацию против унии за двадцать лет до того, как этим стал заниматься ОКоннелл, причем попы вашей церкви его клеймили как демагога? У вас, фениев, короткая память.Вечная, славная и благоговейная память. Алмазная ложа в Арме великолепном, заваленная трупами папистов. При оружии, в масках, плантаторы хриплыми голосами дают присягу. Черный север и истинная голубая библия. Берегись, стриженые[].Стивен сделал легкое движение. В моих жилах тоже кровь бунтарей,  продолжал мистер Дизи.  По женской линии. Но прямой мой предок  сэр Джон Блэквуд[], который голосовал за унию. Все мы ирландцы, и все потомки королей[]. Увы,  сказал Стивен.   [],  твердо произнес мистер Дизи. Это его девиз. Он голосовал за унию и ради этого натянул ботфорты и поскакал в Дублин из Нижнего Ардса.Трала  лала, трала -лала.На Дублин путь кремнист.Деревенщина-сквайр в седле, лоснящиеся ботфорты. Славный денек, сэр Джон. Славный денек, ваша честь. День-денек День-денек Ботфорты болтаются, трусят в Дублин. Трала -лала, трала -лала, трусят. Кстати, это напомнило мне,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вы бы могли оказать мне услугу через ваши литературные знакомства. У меня тут письмо в газету. Вы не присядете на минутку, я бы допечатал конец.Он подошел к письменному столу у окна, подвинул дважды свой стул и перечел несколько слов с листа, заправленного в пишущую машинку. Присаживайтесь. Прошу меня извинить,  сказал он через плечо.  Законы здравого смысла . Одну минутку.Вглядываясь из-под косматых бровей в черновик возле своего локтя и бормоча про себя, он принялся тукать по тугим клавишам машинки, медленно, иногда отдуваясь, когда приходилось возвращать валик, чтобы стереть опечатку.Стивен бесшумно уселся в присутствии августейшей особы. Развешанные по стенам в рамках, почтительно застыли изображенья канувших в Лету лошадей, уставив кверху кроткие морды: Отпор лорда Гастингса, Выстрел герцога Вестминстерского, Цейлон герцога Бофора, взявший Парижский приз в году. На седлах легкие жокеи в чутком ожиданье сигнала. Он следил за их состязанием, поставив на королевские цвета, и сливал свои крики с криками канувших в Лету толп. Точка,  дал указание клавишам мистер Дизи.  Однако скорейшее разрешение этого важного вопроса Куда Крэнли меня привел, чтобы разом разбогатеть, таскались за его фаворитами средь грязью заляпанных бреков, орущих букмекеров у стоек, трактирной вони, месива под ногами. Один к одному на Честного Мятежника, на остальных десять к одному! Мимо жуликов, мимо игроков в кости спешили мы вслед за копытами, картузами и камзолами, и мимо мяснолицей зазнобы мясника, жадно всосавшейся в апельсин[].Пронзительные крики донеслись с поля и трель свистка.Еще гол. Я среди них, в свалке их борющихся тел, на турнире жизни. Ты хочешь сказать, тот маменькин сынок, заморыш со слегка осовелым видом? Турниры. Время отражает толчок толчком, каждый раз. Турниры, грязь и рев битв, застывшая предсмертная блевотина убитых, вопль копий, наживленных кровавыми человечьими кишками. Готово,  произнес мистер Дизи, вставая с места.Он подошел к столу, скрепляя вместе свои листки. Стивен тоже поднялся. Я тут все выразил в двух словах,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Это насчет эпидемии ящура. Взгляните бегло, пожалуйста. Вопрос бесспорный.Позволю себе вторгнуться на ваши уважаемые столбцы. Пресловутая политика невмешательства, которая столь часто в нашей истории. Наша скототорговля.Судьба всех наших старинных промыслов. Ливерпульская клика, похоронившая проект Голуэйского порта[]. Европейские конфликты. Перевозки зерна через узкие проливы. Завидная невозмутимость ведомства земледелия. Не грех вспомнить классиков. Кассандра. От женщины, не блиставшей добродетелью[].Перейдем к сути дела. Я выражаюсь напрямик, вы согласны?  спросил мистер Дизи у читавшего Стивена.Эпидемия ящура. Известен как препарат Коха. Сыворотка и вирус. Процент вакцинированных лошадей. Эпизоотии. Императорские конюшни в Мюрцштеге, Нижняя Австрия. Квалифицированные ветеринары. Мистер Генри Блэквуд Прайс. Любезное предложение беспристрастной проверки. Законы здравого смысла. Вопрос чрезвычайно важен. Взять быка за рога в прямом и переносном смысле. Позвольте поблагодарить за предоставленную возможность. Я хочу, чтобы это напечатали и прочли,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вот увидите, при следующей же вспышке они наложат эмбарго на ирландский скот. А болезнь излечима. И ее лечат. Как пишет мне родственник, Блэквуд Прайс, в Австрии специалисты научились бороться с ней и надежно вылечивают. Они предлагают приехать к нам. Я пробую найти ходы в ведомстве. Сейчас попытаюсь привлечь газеты. Но всюду столько препятствий столько интриг закулисных происков, чтоПодняв указательный палец, он, прежде чем продолжать, погрозил им стариковато в воздухе. Помяните мои слова, мистер Дедал,  сказал он.  Англия в когтях у евреев. Финансы, пресса: на всех самых высоких постах. А это признак упадка нации. Всюду, где они скапливаются, они высасывают из нации соки. Я это наблюдаю не первый год. Ясно как божий день, еврейские торгаши уже ведут свою разрушительную работу. Старая Англия умирает.Он быстро отошел в сторону, и глаза его засветились голубизной, оказавшись в столбе солнечного света. Он оглянулся по сторонам. Умирает,  повторил он,  если уже не умерла.И крики шлюх глухой порой,Британия, ткут саван твой[].Глаза его, расширенные представшим видением, смотрели сурово сквозь солнечный столб, в котором он еще оставался. Но торгаш,  сказал Стивен,  это тот, кто дешево покупает и дорого продает, будь он еврей или не еврей, разве нет? Они согрешили против света,  внушительно произнес мистер Дизи.  У них в глазах тьма. Вот потому им и суждено быть вечными скитальцами по сей день.На ступенях парижской биржи златокожие люди показывают курс на пальцах с драгоценными перстнями. Гусиный гогот. Развязно и шумно толпятся в храме, под неуклюжими цилиндрами зреют замыслы и аферы. Все не их: и одежда, и речь, и жесты. Их выпуклые медлительные глаза противоречили их словам, а жесты были пылки, но незлобивы, хотя они знали об окружающей вражде и знали, что их старания тщетны. Тщетно богатеть, запасать. Время размечет все. Богатство, запасенное у дороги, его разграбят и пустят порукам. Глаза их знали годы скитаний и знали, смиренные, о бесчестье их крови. А кто нет?  спросил Стивен. Что вы хотите сказать?  не понял мистер Дизи.Он сделал шаг вперед и остановился у стола, челюсть косо отвисла в недоумении. И это мудрая старость? Он ждет, пока я ему скажу. История,  произнес Стивен,  это кошмар[], от которого я пытаюсь проснуться.На поле снова крики мальчишек. Трель свистка: гол. А вдруг этот кошмар даст тебе пинка в зад? Пути Господни неисповедимы,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вся история движется к единой великой цели, явлению Бога.Стивен, ткнув пальцем в окошко, проговорил: Вот Бог.Урра! Эх! фью -фьюйть! Как это?  переспросил мистер Дизи. Крик на улице,  отвечал Стивен, пожав плечами[].Мистер Дизи опустил взгляд и некоторое время подержал пальцами переносицу. Потом поднял взгляд и переносицу отпустил. Я счастливей вас,  сказал он.  Мы совершили много ошибок, много грехов. Женщина принесла грех в мир. Из-за женщины, не блиставшей добродетелью, Елены, сбежавшей от Менелая, греки десять лет осаждали Трою. Неверная жена впервые привела чужеземцев на наши берега, жена Макморро[] и ее любовник ОРурк, принц Брефни. И Парнелла[] погубила женщина. Много ошибок. Много неудач, но только не главный грех. Сейчас, на склоне дней своих, я еще борец. И я буду бороться за правое дело до конца.Право свое, волю свою Ольстер добудет в бою[].Стивен поднял руку с листками. Так, значит, сэр  начал он. Сдается мне,  сказал мистер Дизи,  что вы не слишком задержитесь на этой работе. Вы не родились учителем. Хотя, возможно, я ошибаюсь. Скорее, я ученик,  сказал Стивен.А чему тебе тут учиться? Мистер Дизи покачал головой. Как знать? Ученик должен быть смиренным. Но жизнь  великий учитель.Стивен опять зашуршал листками. Так насчет этого  начал он. Да -да,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Я дал вам два экземпляра. Желательно, чтобы напечатали сразу.Телеграф. Айриш Хомстед. Я попробую,  сказал Стивен,  и завтра вам сообщу. Я немного знаком с двумя редакторами. Вот и хорошо,  живо откликнулся мистер Дизи.  Вчера вечером я написал письмо мистеру Филду, Ч.П.[]. Сегодня в гостинице Городской герб собрание Ассоциации скотопромышленников. Я его попросил огласить мое письмо в этом собрании. А вы попробуйте через ваши газеты.Это какие? "Ивнинг телеграф" Вот и хорошо,  повторил мистер Дизи.  Не будем же терять времени. Мне еще надо написать ответ тому родственнику. Всего доброго,  сказал Стивен, пряча листки в карман.  Благодарю вас. Не за что,  отозвался мистер Дизи, принимаясь рыться в бумагах у себя на столе.  Я, хоть и стар, сам люблю скрестить с вами копья. Всего доброго, сэр,  повторил Стивен, кланяясь его склоненной спине.Он вышел на крыльцо через открытые двери и зашагал под деревьями по гравийной дорожке, слыша звонкие голоса и треск клюшек. Львы покойно дремали на постаментах, когда он проходил мимо через ворота, беззубые чудища. Что ж, помогу ему в его баталии. Маллиган даст мне новое прозвище: быколюбивый бард. Мистер Дедал!Нагоняет меня. Надеюсь, не с новым письмом. Одну минутку! Да, сэр,  отозвался Стивен, поворачивая обратно к воротам.Мистер Дизи остановился, запыхавшись, дыша прерывисто и тяжело. Я только хотел добавить,  проговорил он.  Утверждают, что Ирландия, к своей чести, это единственная страна, где никогда не преследовали евреев. Вы это знаете? Нет. А вы знаете почему? Лицо его сурово нахмурилось от яркого света. Почему же, сэр?  спросил Стивен, пряча улыбку. Потому что их сюда никогда не пускали,  торжественно объявил мистер Дизи[].Ком смеха и кашля вылетел у него из горла, потянув за собой трескучую цепь мокроты. Он быстро повернул назад, кашляя и смеясь, размахивая руками над головой. Их никогда сюда не пускали!  еще раз прокричал он сквозь смех, топая по гравию дорожки затянутыми в гетры ногами.  Вот почему.Сквозь ажур листьев солнце рассыпало на его велемудрые плечи пляшущие золотые звездочки и монетки.Эпизод []Неотменимая модальность зримого[]. Хотя бы это, если не больше, говорят моей мысли мои глаза. Я здесь, чтобы прочесть отметы сути вещей: всех этих водорослей, мальков, подступающего прилива, того вон ржавого сапога.Сопливо зеленый, серебряно-синий, ржавый: цветные отметы. Пределы прозрачности. Но он добавляет: в телах. Значит, то, что тела, он усвоил раньше, чем что цветные. Как? А стукнувшись башкой об них, как еще.Осторожно. Он лысый был и миллионер,     []. Предел прозрачного в. Почему в? Прозрачное, непрозрачное. Куда пролезет вся пятерня, это ворота, куда нет  дверь. Закрой глаза и смотри.Стивен, закрыв глаза, прислушался, как хрустят хрупкие ракушки и водоросли у него под ногами. Так или иначе, ты сквозь это идешь. Иду, шажок за шажком. За малый шажок времени сквозь малый шажок пространства.Пять, шесть: это []. Совершенно верно, и это  неотменимая модальность слышимого. Открой глаза. Нет. Господи!

А вдруг все исчезло за это время? Вдруг я открою и окажусь навеки в черноте непрозрачного. Дудки! Умею видеть  буду видеть.Что ж, смотри. Было на месте и без тебя; и пребудет, ныне и присно и во веки веков.Они осторожно спустились по ступеням с Лихи-террас, []; и по отлогому берегу косолапили вяло, в илистом увязая песке. Как я, как Элджи, стремятся к нашей могучей матери. У номера первого шверно[] болталась акушерская сумка, другая тыкала в песок большим зонтиком. На денек выбрались из слободки. Миссис Флоренс Маккейб, вдовица покойного Пэтка Маккейба с Брайд-стрит, горько оплакиваемого. Одна из ее товарок выволокла меня, скулящего, в жизнь. Творение из ничего. Что у нее в сумке? Выкидыш с обрывком пуповины, закутанный в рыжий лоскут. Пуповины всех идут в прошлое, единым проводом связуют-перевивают всю плоть. Вот почему монахи-мистики[]. Будете ли как боги?

Досточтимый Оккам думал об этом, непобедимый доктор. Английским хмурым утром чертячья ипостась щекотала ему мозги. Когда он опускал свою гостию и становился на колени, он слышал, как второй звонок его колокольчика сливается с первым звонком в трансепте (он поднимает свой), а поднимаясь, слышал (теперь я поднимаю), как оба колокольчика (он становится на колени) звенят дифтонгом[].Кузен Стивен[], вам никогда не бывать святым. Остров святых[]. Ведь ты был прямо по уши в святости, а? Молился Пресвятой Деве, чтобы нос был не такой красный.

А не набирал что ни вечер по семи книг, прочесть из каждой по две страницы? Я был молод. Раскланивался сам с собой в зеркале, пресерьезно выходил на аплодисменты, поразительное лицо. Ура отпетому идиоту! Урря! Никто не видел  никому не рассказывай. Собирался написать книги, озаглавив их буквами. А вы прочли его Ф? Конечно, но я предпочитаю К.А как изумительна У. О да, У!

Топкие окошки песка коварно подстерегали его подошвы, смердя сточными водами. Он осторожно обходил их. Пивная бутылка торчала по пояс в вязком песочном тесте. Часовой: остров смертельной жажды[]. Поломанные обручи у самой воды, на песке хитрая путаница почернелых сетей, подальше задние двери с каракулями мелом и выше по берегу веревка с двумя распятыми на ней рубахами.

Грубые скулы под его фуражкой ольстерского боевика[]. Как бежал главный центр[], подлинная история. Переоделся новобрачной, представляете, фата, флердоранж, и укатил по дороге на Малахайд. Именно так, клянусь. Об ушедших вождях[], о тех, кого предали, о безумных побегах. Переодетые, пойманные, сгинувшие  их больше нет.Отвергнутый влюбленный. В ту пору, надо вам сказать, я был этакий деревенский здоровяк, как-нибудь покажу карточку. Клянусь, был таким.Влюбленный, ради ее любви он прокрался с полковником Ричардом Берком, таном[] своего клана, к стенам Клеркенуэллской тюрьмы[] и сквозь туман видел, припав к земле, как пламя мщения швырнуло их вверх. Обращаются в осколки стекло и камень. В веселом городке Париже скрывается он, Иген Парижский, и никто не разыскивает его, кроме меня. Его дневные пристанища, обшарпанная печатня, его три трактирчика, да логово на Монмартре, где коротает он недолгие ночные часы, на рю де ла Гутт-дОр[], дорогое убранство по стенам  засиженные мухами лица ушедших. Без любви, без родины, без жены. А она себе поживает тепло и мило без своего изгнанника, эта мадам на рю Жи-ле-Кер, с канарейкой и двумя франтами-постояльцами. Щечки с пушком, полосатая юбка, игривость, как у молоденькой. Отвергнутый и неунывающий.Скажите Пэту, вы меня видели, хорошо? Я как-то пробовал приискать ему, бедняге, работу.  [], солдат Франции. Я его учил петь Ребята в Килкенни лихие удальцы. Знаете эту старую песню? Я научил ей Патриса. Старый Килкенни: святой Канис[], замок Стронгбоу на Норе[]. А мотив такой: э-эй. За руку Нэппер Тэнди взял меня[].Э эй, ребятаВ КилкенниСлабая, высохшая рука на моей руке. Они забыли Кевина Игена, но не он их. Воспомню тебя, о Сионе[].Он подошел ближе к морю, сырой песок облепил подошвы. Свежий ветер приветно пахнул в лицо, буйный ветер, напоенный лучами, бередящий, как струны, буйные нервы. Я что, собрался идти до самого маяка? Он резко остановился, ноги тут же начали вязнуть. Назад.Повернув, он оглядел берег к югу, ноги снова начали, вязнуть, в новых лунках. Вон башня, холодная сводчатая комната ждет. Снопы света из окон безостановочно движутся, медленно и безостановочно, как вязнут ноги в песке, ползут к сумеркам по полу-циферблату. Синие сумерки, опускается ночь, синяя глубокая ночь. В сводчатой темноте они ждут, их отодвинутые стулья и мой чемодан-обелиск, вокруг стола с оставленными тарелками. Кому убирать? Ключ у него. Я не буду спать там сегодня ночью. Безмолвная башня с закрытой дверью погребла в себе их слепые тела, сахиба  охотника на пантер и его пойнтера. Зов безответен. Он вытащил увязшие ноги и двинулся назад вдоль дамбы из валунов. Все берите, владейте всем. Со мной шагает душа моя, форма форм. Так в лунные стражи торю я тропу над черно-серебристыми скалами[], слыша искусительный поток Эльсинора.Поток догоняет меня. Отсюда мне видно. Тогда возвращайся дорогой на Пулбег, от воды подальше. Он пробрался по скользким водорослям, через осоку, и уселся на скальный стул, пристроив тросточку в расселину.Вздувшийся труп собаки валялся на слое тины. Перед ним  лодочный планшир, потонувший в песке.   [], назвал Луи Вейо[] прозу Готье. Эти грузные дюны  язык, принесенный сюда приливом и ветром.

Фу-фу-фу.Чую, ирландским духом пахнет.Точка, увеличиваясь на глазах, неслась на него по песчаному пространству: живая собака. О боже, она набросится на меня? Уважай ее свободу. Ты не будешь ничьим господином и ничьим рабом. У меня палка. Сиди спокойно. Подальше наискось бредут к берегу из пенистого прилива чьи-то фигуры, две. Две марии[]. Надежно запрятали ее в тростниках. Ку-ку. Я тебя вижу. Нет, собаку. Бежит обратно к ним. Кто?Ладьи лохланнов[] причаливали тут к берегу в поисках добычи, кровавоклювые носы их низко скользили над расплавленным оловом прибоя. Датчане-викинги, бармы томагавков блестят на груди у них, как храбрый Мэйлахи носил на шее обруч золотой[]. Стая кашалотов[] прибилась к берегу в палящий полдень, пуская фонтаны, барахтаясь на мели. И тут, из голодного города за частоколом  орда карликов в кургузых полукафтаньях, мой народ, с мясницкими ножами, бегут, карабкаются, кромсают куски зеленого, ворванью пропахлого мяса. Голод, чума и бойни. Их кровь в моих жилах, их похоти бурлят во мне. Я шел среди них по замерзшей Лиффи, другой я, подменыш, среди плюющихся смолой костров. Не говорил ни с кем; и со мной никто.Собачий лай приближался, смолкал, уносился прочь. Собака моего врага[]. Я стоял неподвижно, безмолвный, бледный, затравленный.  []. Лимонный камзол[], слуга фортуны[], посмеивался над моим страхом. И это тебя манит, собачий лай их аплодисментов? Самозванцы: прожить их жизни. Брат Брюса, Томас Фицджеральд, шелковый рыцарь, Перкин Уорбек, лжеотпрыск Йорка, в бело-розовых шелковых штанах, однодневное диво, и Лэмберт Симнел, со свитой карлов и маркитантов, венчанный поваренок[]. Все потомки королей. Рай для самозванцев и тогда и теперь. Он спасал утопающих, а ты боишься визга дворняги. Но придворные, что насмехались над Гвидо в Ор-сан-Микеле, были у себя в доме[]. В доме На что нам твоя средневековая заумь! Сделал бы ты, как он? Рядом была бы лодка, спасательный буй. [], для тебя специально.Сделал бы или нет? Человек, утонувший девять дней назад возле Мейденрок.Сейчас ждут всплытия. Скажи-ка начистоту. Я хотел бы. Я попытался бы. Я слабовато плаваю. Вода холодная, мягкая. Когда я окунул голову в таз, в Клонгоузе. Ничего не вижу! Кто там за мной? Скорей обратно, скорей! Видишь, как быстро прилив прибывает со всех сторон, как быстро заполняет все ложбинки песков, цвета шелухи от бобов какао? Если бы под ногами была земля. И все равно хочу, чтобы его жизнь была его, а моя моей. Утопленник.Его человечьи глаза кричат мне из ужаса его смерти. Я Вместе с ним на дно Я не мог ее спасти. Вода  горькая смерть  сгинул.Женщина и мужчина. Вижу ее юбчонки. Похоже, подоткнуты.Их пес суетился возле осыпающейся грядки песка, рыскал вокруг, обнюхивая со всех сторон. Что-то ищет, что потерял в прошлой жизни.Внезапно он помчался, как заяц, уши назад, погнавшись за тенью низко летящей чайки. Резкий свист мужчины ударил в его вислые ухи. Он повернул и помчался назад, приблизился, мелькающие лапы перешли на рысцу. В червленом поле олень бегущий, цвета природного, без рогов. У кружевной кромки прилива остановился, упершись передними копытами, насторожив уши к морю.Задравши морду, облаял шумные волны, стада моржей. Они подползали к его ногам, закручиваясь кольцами, вспенивая, каждая девятая, белый гребень, разбиваясь, расплескиваясь, издалека, из дальнего далека, волны и волны.Сборщики моллюсков. Они зашли в воду, нагнувшись, окунули свои мешки, вытащили, вышли обратно. Пес с визгом подбежал к ним, вскинулся на них лапами, потом опустил лапы на песок, потом снова вскинул их на хозяев с немою медвежеватою лаской. Оставленный без взаимности, он потрусил следом за ними на сухое, и тряпка волчьего языка краснопыхтела из пасти.Пятнистое его тело трусцой выдвинулось вперед, потом вдруг припустило телячьим галопом. Собачий труп лежал у него на пути. Он остановился, обнюхал, обошел кругом, братец, обнюхал тщательней, сделал еще один обход, быстро, по-собачьи, обнюхивая всю грязную шкуру дохлого пса. Песий череп, песий нюх, глаза в землю, движется к единой великой цели. Эх, пес-бедолага! Здесь лежит тело пса-бедолаги. Падаль! Живо оттуда, псина!Присмирев от окрика, он вернулся, и несильный пинок босой хозяйской ноги швырнул его, сжавшегося на лету, за грядку песка. Подался обратно, описав вороватую кривую. Не видит меня. У края дамбы задержался, посуетился, обнюхал валун и помочился на него, задрав заднюю ногу.Потрусил вперед, задрал снова заднюю ногу и быстро, коротко помочился на необнюханный валун. Простые радости бедняков. Потом задние лапы стали раскидывать песок; потом передние принялись грести, рыть. Что-то он тут хоронит, бабку свою. Он вгрызался в песок, разгребая, раскидывая; остановился, прислушался, снова принялся рыть яростными когтями, но вскоре перестал, леопард, пантера, зачатый в прелюбодействе, пожирающий мертвых.После того как он меня разбудил этой ночью, тот же самый сон или? Постой. Открытая дверь. Квартал проституток. Припомни. Гарун-аль-Рашид.Ага, постепенькаю. Тот человек вел меня и говорил что-то. Я не боялся. У него была дыня, он ее поднес мне к лицу. Улыбался; сливками пахнул плод[].Таков обычай, сказал он. Входи. Красный ковер расстелен. Увидишь кто.Взвалив на плечи мешки, тащились они, краснокожие египтяне. Цыгане[]. Его посинелые ноги в подвернутых штанах шлепали по сырому липучему песку, темно-кирпичный шарф схлестнул небритую шею. Женской походкой она семенит за ним: разбойник и его девка. Добыча их болтается у нее за спиной. Босые ноги ее облеплены песком, осколками ракушек, волосы распушились вокруг обветренного лица. За своим господином его сподручница  в град столичный.Когда ночь скроет изъяны тела, она зазывает, закутанная в темную шаль, из подворотни, где гадят псы. Дружок ее угощает двух королевских стрелков у ОЛоклина на Блэкпиттсе. А подружка, это по их блатной музыке маруха, потому что Эх, фартовая маруха[]. Белизна дьяволицы под ее вонючими тряпками.

Адам непадший покрывал и не ведал похоти. Пускай распевает: Маркоташки-голубки. Язык ничуть не хуже, чем у него.

Грядет он[], бледнолицый вампир, сверкают глаза сквозь бурю, паруса, крылья нетопыря, кровавят море, уста к ее лобзающим устам.Так. Пришпилим-ка этого молодца, а? Где грифель мой[]. Уста ее в лобзанье. Нет. Надо, чтоб были двое. И склей их вместе. Уста к ее лобзающим устам.Его губы ловили и лобзали бесплотные губы воздуха: уста к тому, чем породила. Иила, лоно всех могила. Уста округлились, но выпускали одно дыхание, бессловесно: ооиииаа: рев рушащихся водопадом планет, шарообразных, раскаленных, ревущих: прочь-прроочь-прроочь-прроочь. Бумаги мне. Деньги, разрази их. Письмо старины Дизи. Вот. Благодарю за предоставленную возможность оторвать свободный клочок. Повернувшись к солнцу спиной и низко склонившись к каменному столу, он принялся строчить слова. Второй раз забываю взять чистые бланки в библиотеке.Тень его лежала на скале, над которою он склонился, оканчиваясь. А почему не бесконечна, не до самой дальней звезды? Они темны там, за пределами света, тьма в свете светит, дельта Кассиопеи, миры. Мое я сидит здесь с ясеневым жезлом жреца, в заемных сандалиях, днем возле свинцово-серого моря, незримо, в лиловой ночи движется под эгидою загадочных звезд. Я отбрасываю от себя эту оконеченную тень, неотменимый антропоконтур, призываю ее обратно. Будь бесконечна, была бы она моей, формой моей формы? Кто здесь видит меня? Кто прочтет где-нибудь и когда-нибудь слова, что я написал? Значки по белому полю. Кто-нибудь и кому-нибудь твоим самым сладкозвучным голосом. Добрый епископ Клойнский[] извлек храмовую завесу из своей пасторской шляпы: завесу пространства с цветными эмблемами, вышитыми по ее полю. Постой, подумай. Цветные на плоском: да, именно. Я вижу плоское, а мыслю расстояние, вблизи, вдали, а вижу плоское, на восток, сзади. Ага, понятно! Внезапно падает и застывает в стереоскопе. Щелк  и весь фокус. Вам кажутся темными мои слова. Тьма в наших душах, этого вам не кажется? Сладкозвучней. Наши души, стыдом язвимые за наши грехи, еще теснее льнут к нам, как женщина, льнущая к возлюбленному, теснее, еще теснее.Она доверяется мне, у нее нежная рука, глаза с длинными ресницами. Куда только, шут меня возьми, я тащу ее за завесу? В неотменимую модальность неотменимой зримости. Она, она, она. Что она? Дева у витрины Ходжеса Фиггиса[] в понедельник, искала одну из тех алфавитных книг, что ты собирался написать. Ты в нее так и впился взглядом. Запястье продето в плетеную петлю зонтика. Живет в Лисон-парке, на чувствах и розовых лепестках, литературная дама. Рассказывай, Стиви[]: просто уличная. Клянусь, она носит эти уродские пояса с резинками и желтые чулки, штопанные толстой шерстью. Поговори про яблочные пирожки, []. И где твой разум?Коснись меня. Мягкий взгляд. Мягкая мягкая мягкая рука. Я одинок здесь.О, коснись меня скорее, сейчас. Что это за слово, которое знают все[]? Я здесь один, я тих. Я печален. Коснись же, коснись меня.Он растянулся навзничь на острых скалах, засунув в карман карандаш и исписанный клочок, надвинув на глаза шляпу. Это в точности жест Кевина Игена, когда он устраивается вздремнуть, посубботствовать.   .   []. Алло! Бонжур, добро пожаловать, рады вам, как майским цветам[]. Под ее укрытием[], сквозь павлиньих подрагиванье ресниц, он глядел на южнеющее солнце. Тут как в раскаленной печи. Час Пана, полуденный отдых фавна.Средь соконалитых змеерастений, млекоточивых плодов, где широко раскинулись листья на бронзовоцветных водах. Боль далеко.Не прячь глаза и не скорби.Взор его поскорбел над тупоносыми башмаками, быка обносками . Он сосчитал вмятины на покоробленной коже, в которой удобно гнездилась прежде нога другого. Нога, что мерно пристукивала по земле, неприятная мне нога. Ты был, однако, в восторге, когда башмачок Эстер Освальт[] подошел тебе, знакомая девица в Париже. ,   []! Верный друг, братская душа: любовь Уайльда, та, что назвать себя не смеет[]. Теперь он бросит меня. А чья вина? Каков я есть. Каков я есть. Все или ничего[].Длинными упругими петлями струился поток из озера Кок[], зелено-золотистым заполняя песчаные лагуны, набирая силу, струясь. Этак тросточка моя уплывет. Подожду. Нет, минует, ударяясь в низкие скалы, завиваясь в воронки, минуя. Давай лучше побыстрей с этим делом. Слушай: четырехсловная речь волн  сиссс суссс пыссс фсс. Ярое дыхание вод средь морских змеев, вздыбленных коней, скал. Они плещутся в чашах скал: плеск  плям  плен: пленены в бочках. И, иссякая, речь их стихает. Они льются, журча, широко разливаясь, неся гроздья пены, распускающиеся цветы.Он видел, как под закипающим приливом извиваются водоросли[], истомлено поднимая и колебля слабо противящиеся руки, задирая подолы, в шепчущих струях колебля и простирая вверх робкие серебристые ростки. День за днем, ночь за ночью, захлестнуты  вздымаются  опадают вновь. Боже, они устали; и под шепот струй к ним, вздыхают. Святому Амвросию[] внятны были эти вздохи волн и ветвей, ждущих, жаждущих исполнения своих сроков:      []. Без цели собраны, без пользы отпущены; склонятся вперед  вернутся назад: ткацкий станок луны. Как они, истомленная, под взглядами любовников, сластолюбивых мужчин, нагая женщина, сияющая в своих чертогах, влачит она бремя вод.Там будет саженей пять. Отец твой спит на дне морском[], над ним саженей пять. В час, он сказал. Найден утопленник. Полный прилив на Дублинской отмели. Гонит перед собой наносы гальки, случайные ракушки, широкие стаи рыбы. Труп, выбеленный солью, всплывает из отката, покачивается к берегу, едет-едет сам-сам, самец. Вон он. Цепляй живо. Хотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертанья. Готово, наш. Полегче теперь.Мешок трупных газов, сочащийся зловонной жижей. Стайка мальков, отъевшихся на рыхлом лакомстве, стрелой вылетает через щели его застегнутой ширинки. Бог стал человеком человек рыбой рыба гагарой гагара перинной горой[]. Дыханьями мертвых дышу я живой, ступаю по праху мертвых, пожираю мочой пропитанную требуху от всех мертвых. Мешком переваленный через борт, он испускает смрад своей зеленой могилы, лепрозная дыра носа храпит на солнце.Морской сюрприз, соль высинила карие глаза. Морская смерть, мягчайшая из всех, ведомых человеку[]. Древний отец Океан[]. Парижский приз  остерегайтесь подделки. Рекомендуем проверить. Мы получили огромное удовольствие.Ступай. Пить хочется[]. Собираются облака. А тучи где-нибудь есть, нет? Гроза. Сверкая, он низвергается, гордая молния разума[], , ,   []. Нет.В шляпе, с посохом бреду, башмаки стучат[]. Его-мои башмаки. Куда? В закатные земли, в страну вечернюю. Вечер обретет себя.Он взял тросточку за эфес, сделал ею легкий выпад, еще в нерешительности. Да. Вечер обретет себя во мне  без меня. Все дни приходят к концу. Кстати, на той неделе, когда там во вторник самый длинный день. Несет нам радость новый год, о мать, тарам-пам-пам[].Благородному поэту Лаун-Теннисону. []. Старой желтозубой ведьме. И мсье Дрюмону, благородному журналисту. . А зубы у меня совсем плохие. Почему, интересно? Пощупай. Этот тоже шатается. Скорлупки. Надо бы, наверно, к зубному на эти деньги, а? И тот. Беззубый Клинк, сверхчеловек[]. Почему это, интересно, или, может, тут что-то кроется?Платок мой. Он забрал. Помню. А я назад не забрал?Рука тщетно пошарила в карманах. Нет, не забрал. Лучше другой купить.Он аккуратно положил сухую козявку, которую уколупнул в носу, на выступ скалы. Желающие пусть смотрят.Позади. Кажется, кто-то есть.Он обернулся через плечо, взирая назад. Пронося в воздухе высокие перекладины трех мачт, с парусами, убранными по трем крестам салингов, домой, против течения, безмолвно скользя, безмолвный корабль.Эпизод []Мистер Леопольд Блум с удовольствием ел внутренние органы животных и птиц. Он любил жирный суп из гусиных потрохов, пупки с орехами, жареное фаршированное сердце, печенку, поджаренную ломтиками в сухарях, жареные наважьи молоки. Всего же больше любил он бараньи почки на углях, которые оставляли во рту тонкий привкус с отдаленным ароматом мочи.Почки не выходили из головы у него, пока он, стараясь тихо ступать, собирал для нее завтрак на горбатом подносе. На кухне было прохладно, даже зябко, хотя за окном стояло летнее погожее утро. Это как-то еще разжигало аппетит.Уголь в очаге разгорался.Хлеб с маслом: еще ломтик  три, четыре  и хватит. Она не любит, когда гора на тарелке. Хватит. Отойдя от подноса, он снял с полки чайник и поставил на огонь сбоку. Чайник сел тусклой глыбой, выставив торчком хобот. Скоро поспеет. Хорошо. Во рту сухо.Кошка ходила на прямых лапах вокруг ножки стола, хвост кверху. Мррау! А, вот ты где,  сказал мистер Блум, оборачиваясь от очага.Кошка мяукнула в ответ и продолжала путь вокруг ножки, ступая на прямых лапах, мяукая. Вот так же она разгуливает по моему письменному столу.Мурр. Почеши за ушком. Мурр.Мистер Блум с добродушным интересом поглядел на черное гибкое существо.Ладный вид: шерстка гладкая и блестит, белая пуговка под хвостом, глаза зеленые, светятся. Он нагнулся к ней, упершись ладонями в колени. Молочка киске! Мррау!  громко мяукнула она.Говорят, они глупые. Они понимают, что мы говорим, лучше, чем мы их понимаем. Вот эта все что хочет поймет. И злопамятная. Интересно, каким я ей кажусь. Вышиной с башню? Нет, она ведь может на меня вспрыгнуть. А цыплят боится,  поддразнил он ее.  Боится цыпцыпочек. В жизни не видал такой глупой киски.Жестокая. Это у них в природе. Странно, что мыши при этом не пищат. Как будто им нравится. Мгррау!  мяукнула она громче.Глаза ее, жадные, полуприкрытые от стыда, моргнули, и, жалобно, протяжно мяукнув, она выставила свои молочно-белые зубки. Он видел, как сужаются от жадности черные щелки ее зрачков, превращая глаза в зеленые камешки. Подойдя к шкафу, он взял кувшин, свеженаполненный разносчиком от Ханлона, налил на блюдце теплопузырчатого молока и осторожно поставил блюдце на пол. Мяв!  взвизгнула она, кидаясь к еде.Он смотрел, как металлически поблескивают ее усы в тусклом свете и как, трижды примерившись, она легко принялась лакать. Правда или нет, что, если усы подрезать, не сможет охотиться. Почему бы? Может, кончики светят в темноте. Или служат как щупики, возможно.Он слушал, как она лакает. Яичницу с ветчиной не стоит. В такую сушь яйца нехорошо. Хочется свежей, чистой воды. Баранью почку у Бакли сегодня тоже не стоит: четверг. Обжарить в масле  и с перчиком. Лучше свиную почку у Длугача. Пока чайник не закипел. Она лакала все медленней, потом вылизала блюдце. Почему у них языки такие шершавые? Лакать удобней, сплошь пористые, в дырочках. Ничего она тут не слопает? Он поглядел кругом.Ничего.Тихо поскрипывая подошвами, он поднялся по лестнице в переднюю и стал у дверей спальни. Может, она захочет чего-нибудь повкусней. Обычно предпочитает небольшие бутербродики утром. Но все-таки  вдруг.Он проговорил негромко, стоя в пустой передней: Я схожу за угол. Через минуту вернусь.Услышал звуки своего голоса, добавил: Тебе чего-нибудь не захватить к завтраку?Мягкий и сонный голос пробормотал в ответ: Нне.Нет. Ничего не хочет. Затем послышался глубокий парной вздох, еще мягче, это она повернулась в постели, и разболтанные медные кольца звякнули. Надо, чтоб подтянули. Жаль. Из Гибралтара, неблизкий путь.Совсем забыла испанский, и ту малость, что знала. Интересно, сколько папаша за нее заплатил. Фасон старинный. Ах да, конечно. С губернаторского аукциона. По знакомству. По части денег старина Твиди кремень. Да, сэр.Было дело под Плевной. Я вышел из рядовых, сэр, и горжусь этим. Но все-таки хватило ума провернуть дельце с марками. Проявил дальновидность.Рука его сняла шляпу с крючка над толстым пальто с его монограммой и над ношеным плащом с распродажи забытых вещей. Марка: картинка, а сзади клей. Наверняка из офицеров многие этим промышляют. Что говорить.Пропотевшее клеймо на дне шляпы молча сообщило ему: Плестоу, шляпы-лю. Он заглянул воровато за кожаный ободок. Белая полоска бумаги. Надежное место.На крыльце он ощупал брючный карман: тут ли ключ. Нету. В тех, что оставил. Надо бы взять. Картофелина на месте[]. Гардероб скрипит. Не стоит ее тревожить. Была совсем сонная. Он притянул дверь к себе, осторожно, еще чуть-чуть, пока защитная полоска внизу не прикрыла порожек усталым веком.На вид закрыто. Обойдется до моего прихода.Он перешел на солнечную сторону, минуя открытый люк погреба в семьдесят пятом доме. Солнце приближалось к шпилю церкви святого Георгия. Похоже, день будет жаркий. Когда в этом черном, особенно чувствуешь. Черное проводит, отражает (а может, преломляет?) тепло. Но в светлом костюме никак нельзя. Не пикник. От ощущения блаженного тепла глаза его часто жмурились, фургон из пекарни Боланда лотки наш насущный но ей вчерашний больше по вкусу пироги горячая хрустящая корочка. Чувствуешь себя помолодевшим. Где-нибудь на востоке, вот таким утром, пуститься в путь на заре. Будешь двигаться впереди солнца  выиграешь у него день. А если все время так, то в принципе никогда не постареешь ни на один день. Идешь вдоль берега, в незнакомой стране, подходишь к городским воротам, там стража, тоже какой-нибудь служака с усищами старины Твиди опирается на этакую длинную пику. Бродишь по улицам под навесами. Головы прохожих в тюрбанах. Темные пещеры лавок, где торгуют коврами, внутри здоровенный турок, Свирепый турка, сидит, поджавши ноги, покуривая витой кальян. Крики разносчиков. Для питья вода с укропом, шербет. Слоняешься целый день.Можешь повстречать парочку грабителей. Ну и что, повстречаешь. Солнце к закату. Тени мечетей между колонн; мулла со свитком в руках. Дрожь по деревьям, сигнал, вечерняя свежесть. Прохожу дальше. Гаснущее золотое небо. Мать на пороге хижины. Зовет детишек домой на своем темном наречии.Из за высокой стены звуки струн. Луна в ночном небе, лиловая, как новые подвязки у Молли. Звуки струн. Слушаешь. Девушка играет на этом инструменте, как же он называется, цимбалы. Идешь дальше.А может быть, там все и не так. Начитался этой ерунды: по следам солнца[]. С сияющим солнцем на титуле. Он усмехнулся самодовольно. Как сказал Артур Гриффит про ту заставку над передовицей во Фримене: солнце гомруля восходит на северо-западе из переулка за Ирландским банком[]. Он длил усмешку. В духе еврейского остроумия: солнце гомруля восходит на северо-западе.Он приблизился к пивной Ларри ОРурка. Из-под решетки погреба плыли влажные испарения портера. Через раскрытые двери бара несло имбирем, бросовым чаем и бисквитной трухой. Но заведение стоящее: как раз у трамвайного кольца. Скажем, Маколи там подальше: гиблое место. А если бы провели линию вдоль Северной окружной, от скотного рынка к набережным, цена тут же бы подскочила.Лысая голова над занавеской. Прижимист старый пройдоха. Насчет рекламы с ним бесполезно. Что ж, в своем деле ему видней. Вон он, наш бравый Ларри, без пиджака, прислонясь к мешкам с сахаром, созерцает, как прислужник в фартуке орудует с ведром и шваброй. Саймон Дедал его отлично копирует, как он щурит свои глазенки. Знаете, я вам что скажу? Что же, мистер ОРурк? Знаете, для японцев русские  только закуска к завтраку.Стоп, надо перекинуться парой слов: может, про похороны. Бедняга Дигнам, вы уже слышали, мистер ОРурк?Сворачивая на Дорсет-стрит, он бодро окликнул в дверь: День добрый, мистер ОРурк. Добрый день, добрый день. Хорошая погодка, сэр. Ничего не скажешь.Откуда у них деньги берутся? Наезжают рыжаки-прислужники из графства Лейтрим, моют стаканы да сливают опивки в погребе. И вдруг, любуйтесь, он уже процветает, как Адам Финдлейтерс или Дэн Таллонс. А еще учесть конкуренцию. Повальная жажда. Неплохая головоломка: пересечь Дублин и не натолкнуться на кабак. Тут просто так не скопишь. Может, с пьяных имеют.Принес три, записал пять. Ну и что это? Там бобик[], тут бобик, одни крохи. А может, на оптовых заказах. Стакнется с агентом поставщиков. Ты босса своего обработай, а навар пополам, идет?Сколько он может взять за месяц на портере? Скажем, сбыл десять бочек.Скажем, он имеет десять процентов. Какие там десять. Пятнадцать. Он проходил мимо школы святого Иосифа. Галдят, сорванцы. Окна настежь. Свежий воздух помогает запоминать. И хором полезно. Эйбиси дифиджи килумен опикью эрэстэ видаблью. Это мальчишки там? Да. Иништерк. Инишарк. Инишбоффин.Зубрят свою смехографию. Мою. Горы Блум[].Он остановился перед витриной Длугача, глядя на связки колбас, копченых и кровяных, темных и светлых. Пятнадцать помножить на. Цифры, ускользая, вертелись в его мозгу: он недовольно прогнал их. Глянцевитые кольца, туго начиненные мясом, насыщали его взгляд, и он безмятежно вдыхал пряный и парной запах вареной свиной крови.Почка сочила кровь на блюдо с рисунком из ивовых ветвей: последняя. Он стоял у прилавка следом за соседской прислугой. Возьмет ее или нет? Она вычитывала по пунктам, держа в руке списочек. Руки потрескались: от стирки. И полтора фунта сосисок Денни. Взгляд его приковали мощные бедра.Вудс его фамилия. Чем занимается неизвестно. Жена уже старовата. Свежая кровь. Ухажеров не разрешают. Руки крепкие. Выбивала ковер на веревке.Серьезно выбивала, я вам скажу. Юбка сбилась на сторону, взлетала с каждым ударом.Хореглазый свинопродавец свертывал низку сосисок толстыми, розовыми, как сосиски, пальцами. Эк тугомяса, что телка откормленная в стойле.Он взял один листок из лежавшей стопки. Образцовая ферма в Киннерете, на берегу Тивериадского озера. Можно создать идеальный зимний санаторий.Мозес Монтефиоре[], я так и думал. Усадьба обнесена стеной, в смутной дымке пасущиеся стада. Он отставил от себя листок: интересно; прочесть повнимательней, пасущиеся стада в дымке, листок похрустывал. Молоденькая белая телочка. Бывало, поутру на скотном рынке[]: ревут быки, клейменые овцы в загонах, шлепается навоз, скотоводы чавкают по грязи в кованых сапогах, держа неошкуренные прутья, похлопывают скотину по мясистым задам, гляди  первый сорт. Он заставлял себя невозмутимо держать листок, обуздывая волю и чувства, устремив в точку кроткий застывший взор. Юбка сбилась, взлетала каждый раз  рраз  рраз.Свинопродавец выхватил два листа из стопки, завернул первосортные сосиски, осклабил медную рожу. Пожалте, мисс.С дерзкой ухмылкой она протянула ему монету в своей мощной руке. Благодарим, мисс. Сдача шиллинг три пенса. А вам, сэр?Мистер Блум, не мешкая, показал. Догнать и пойти за ней, если недалеко еще, следом за колыхающимися окороками. Недурно, как первая утренняя картинка. Да поживей ты, тьфу. Куй железо, пока горячо. Она вышла из лавки, постояла на ярком солнце и двинулась ленивой походкой направо. Он вздохнул, выпустив воздух через нос: они никогда не понимают. Руки огрубели от стирки. И на ногах ногти с наростами. Изодранная темная власяница защищает все подступы. Укол от ее равнодушия разгорелся в груди у него до слабого наслаждения. Не тебе, другому: какой-то констебль на досуге тискал ее на Экклс-лейн. Они любят, когда есть за что подержаться.Первосортные сосиски. Ах-ах, я заблудилась, о мистер полисмен. Три пенса, сэр.Рука его приняла влажную мякоть и опустила в боковой карман. Затем выудила из брючного кармана три монетки и положила на резиновые пупырышки.Они полежали миг, были мигом подсчитаны и мигом отправлены, одна за другой, в ящик кассы. Спасибо, сэр. Заходите.Лисьи глазки, благодаря его, метнули испытующую искорку. Мистер Блум почти сразу же отвел взгляд. Нет  лучше не стоит  в другой раз. Всего доброго,  произнес он, уходя. Всего доброго, сэр.Ни следа. Скрылась. Ну и ладно.Он зашагал обратно по Дорсет-стрит, углубившись в чтение. Агендат Нетаим[] товарищество плантаторов. Приобрести у турецкого правительства большие песчаные участки и засадить эвкалиптовыми деревьями. Дают отличную тень, топливо и строительный материал. Апельсиновые плантации и необъятные дынные бахчи к северу от Яффы. Вы платите восемьдесят марок, и для вас засаживают дунам земли маслинами, апельсинами, миндалем или лимонами.Маслины дешевле: для апельсинов нужно искусственное орошение. Ежегодно вам высылаются образцы урожая. Вас вносят в книги товарищества в качестве пожизненного владельца. Можете уплатить наличными десять, потом годичные взносы. Берлин , Бляйбтройштрассе, .Не выйдет. Но что-то есть в этом.Он видел стадо в знойной серебристой дымке. Пыльные, серебристые маслины. Долгие безмятежные дни: уход за деревьями, сбор плодов. Маслины, кажется, кладут в банки? Дома несколько осталось, от Эндрюса. Молли сперва плевалась, теперь входит во вкус. Апельсины в папиросной бумаге укладывают в ящики. Другие цитрусы так же. Цитроны. Интересно, там ли еще бедняга Цитрон, на Сент-Кевин-пэрейд. И Мастянский со своей цитрой[]. Славные у нас были вечера. Молли в плетеном кресле Цитрона. Приятно взять в руки, плод восковой, прохладный, подержишь, поднесешь к носу и вдохнешь аромат. Такой густой, сладкий, одуряющий аромат. Всегда такой же, из года в год. И по хорошей цене идут, Мойзел мне говорил. Арбьютес-плейс, Плизентс-стрит; добрые старые времена. Он говорил, нельзя ни малейшего изъяна[]. Проходят весь этот путь: Испания, Гибралтар, Средиземное море, Ближний Восток.Штабеля ящиков в Яффе на набережной, клерк их вычеркивает в гроссбухе, грузчики в замасленных робах таскают. Вон этот, какбишьего, выходит от.Как ваши де? Не смотрит. Одна скука, когда встречаешь шапочного знакомца.Спина как у того норвежского капитана[]. Интересно, еще раз встречу его сегодня? Поливалка. Накликать дождь. На небеси и на земли.Облако начало закрывать солнце: медленно, больше и больше, целиком.Серое. Вдалеке.Нет, там не так. Бесплодный, голый, пустынный край. Вулканическое озеро, мертвое море: ни рыбы, ни водорослей, глубокая впадина в земле.Ветру не всколыхнуть эти воды, свинцово-серые, с ядовитыми испарениями.Это называется дождь серный; города долины  Содом, Гоморра, Едом[]. Мертвые имена. Мертвое море в мертвой стране, седой, древней. Древней сейчас. Она кормила древнейшее, изначальное племя. Сгорбленная старуха перешла улицу у лавки Кэссиди, цепко сжимая в когтях бутылку. Древнейший народ. Скитался в дальних краях, по всей земле, из плена в плен, плодясь, умирая, рождаясь повсюду. Земля же его лежит там. И больше не может уже родить. Мертва  старушиная  седая запавшая пизда планеты.Запустение.Седой ужас опалил его плоть. Сложив листок, сунув его в карман, он повернул на Экклс-стрит, торопясь домой. Холодная маслянистость ползла по его жилам, леденя кровь; годы одевали его в соляной покров. Что же, такие мои дела. Ранняя рань, а на уме дрянь. Не с той ноги встал. Надо снова начать упражнения по Сэндоу[]. Стойку на руках. Кирпичные бурые дома в пежинах. Восьмидесятый так и пустует. Почему бы? Всего двадцать восемь фунтов по оценке. Тауэрс, Баттерсби, Норт, Макартур: все окна первого этажа в билетиках. Нашлепки на больном глазу. Вдохнуть теплый парок от чайника, дымок от масла на сковородке. Подойти поближе к ней, полнотелой, в теплой постели. Да, да.Стремительные жаркие лучи солнца примчались от Беркли-роуд, проворные, в легких сандалиях, по просиявшему тротуару. Вон она, вон она стремится навстречу мне, девушка с золотыми волосами по ветру.Открытка и два письма на полу в прихожей. Он, наклонившись, поднял.Миссис Мэрион Блум[]. Стремительный ритм сердца резко упал. Дерзкий почерк.Миссис Мэрион. Польди!Войдя в спальню, он полуприкрыл глаза и, двигаясь сквозь теплый и желтый сумрак, приблизился к ее растрепанной голове. Кому там письма?Он поглядел на них. Моллингар. Милли. Письмо мне от Милли,  сказал он, следя за своим голосом,  а тебе открытка. И письмо тебе.Он положил ее письмо и открытку на саржевое покрывало у сгиба ее колен. Тебе шторы поднять?Подтягивая осторожно шторы до половины, он видел через плечо, как она глянула на конверт и сунула его под подушку. Хватит так?  спросил он, оборачиваясь.Она читала открытку, приподнявшись на локте. Посылка дошла уже,  сказала она.Он не уходил; она отложила открытку и медленно, с блаженным вздохом, опять свернулась клубком. Давай-ка чай поскорей,  поторопила она.  Совсем горло пересохло. Чайник уже кипит.Однако он задержался убрать со стула: полосатая нижняя юбка, нечистое мятое белье; и, взяв все в охапку, положил в ноги постели.Когда он был уже на ступеньках, она окликнула: Польди! Что? Ошпарь заварной чайник.Вполне закипел: пар валит из носика. Он ошпарил и сполоснул заварной чайник, насыпал четыре полных ложечки чаю и, наклонив большой чайник, залил чай водой. Поставив чай настояться, он отодвинул большой чайник в сторону и, вдавив сковороду прямо в жар угля, смотрел, как масло плавится и скользит по ней. Когда он развернул почку, кошка жадно мяукнула рядом с ним. Если ей давать много мяса, не будет мышей ловить. Говорят, они не едят свинину. Кошер. Он бросил ей окровавленную обертку и положил почку в шипящее масло. Перцу. Он взял щепотку из выщербленной рюмки для яйца, посыпал круговыми движениями.Потом он распечатал письмо, скользнул глазами по всей странице. Спасибо  новая беретка  мистер Коклан  пикник на озере Оул  студент  приморские красотки Буяна Бойлана[].Чай настоялся. Улыбаясь, он налил себе в свою чашку, имитация фарфора Кроун-Дерби, с приспособлением для усов. Подарок Милли-глупышки ко дню рождения. Тогда ей было всего пять лет. Нет, погоди: четыре. Принес ей бусики под янтарь, она тут же порвала. Опускал для нее в почтовый ящик сложенные листочки. Он улыбался, наливая чай.О Милли Блум, ты мне мила, моя родная,В тебя, как в зеркало, гляжусь, тебя желая.Хоть ты бедна, хочу я быть с тобою рядом,А не с той Кэти, что виляет толстым задом[].Бедный старый профессор Гудвин. Конечно, слегка ку-ку. Но до того учтивый старичок. Провожал Молли с эстрады на старомодный манер. А это зеркальце в цилиндре. В тот вечер Милли его притащила в гостиную. Ой, поглядите, чего было в шляпе у профессора Гудвина! Мы все смеялись.Женская натура уже тогда проявлялась. Такая была вострушка.Он поддел почку вилкой, перевернул, потом поставил заварной чайник на поднос. Горб стал пружинить, когда он поднял поднос. Все взял? Бутерброды  четыре, сахар, ложечка, сливки. Так. Он направился с подносом наверх, продев большой палец в ручку чайника.Толкнув дверь коленом, он вошел и поставил поднос на стул у изголовья постели. До чего же ты долго,  сказала она.Медь задребезжала, когда она проворно приподнялась, упершись локтем в подушку. Он спокойно смотрел на ее полные формы и на ложбинку между мягких больших грудей, круглившихся в ночной рубашке, как козье вымя. Тепло, шедшее от ее тела, мешалось в воздухе с душистым запахом наливаемого чая.Краешек распечатанного конверта торчал из-под примятой подушки. Уже уходя, он остановился поправить покрывало. А от кого письмо?  спросил он.Дерзкий почерк. Мэрион. Да от Бойлана,  сказала она.  Должен программу принести. Что ты собираешься петь?   [] с Дойлом[],  ответила она,  и Старую сладкую песню любви[].Она пила чай, полные губы улыбались. Довольно затхлый дух от этих курений на другой день. Как тухлая вода от цветов. Может быть, приоткрыть окошко?Отправляя в рот сложенный пополам тонкий ломтик, она спросила: А во сколько похороны? В одиннадцать, кажется,  ответил он.  Я еще не смотрел газету.Следуя знаку ее пальца, он поднял за штанину ее грязные панталоны. Не то? Тогда серую перекрученную подвязку с чулком: подошва мятая, залоснилась. Да нет же, книжку.Другой чулок. Нижняя юбка. Должно быть, упала,  сказала она.Он поглядел по сторонам.    []. Интересно, правильно ли она произносит . На кровати нигде.Завалилась куда-то. Он нагнулся и приподнял подзор. Упавшая книга распласталась на пузе ночного горшка в оранжевую полоску. Дай-ка мне,  сказала она.  Я тут отметила. Хотела одно слово спросить.Сделав глоток из чашки, которую держала за неручку, и обтерев бесцеремонно пальцы об одеяло, она принялась водить по странице шпилькой, покуда не нашла слово. Метим что?  переспросил он. Вот это,  сказала она.  Что это значит?Наклонившись, он прочел подле холеного ногтя на ее большом пальце. Метемпсихоз? Вот-вот. С чем это вообще едят? Метемпсихоз,  начал он, морща лоб,  это греческое. Из греческого языка. Это означает переселение душ. Ну и дичь!  оценила она.  А теперь скажи по-простому.Он улыбнулся, искоса глянув в ее смеющиеся глаза. Все те же молодые глаза. Первый вечер после игры в шарады. Долфинс-барн. Он полистал замусоленные страницы. Руби  краса арены. Ага, картинка. Свирепый итальянец с хлыстом. А это видно Руби краса чего там положено голая на полу. Милостиво дали прикрыться. Злодей Маффей остановился и с проклятиями отшвырнул прочь свою жертву. Всюду жестокость. Одурманенные звери. Трапеция в цирке Хенглера. Не мог смотреть, отвернулся. А толпа глазеет. Ты там надрывай силы а мы животики себе надорвем. Их целые семьи.Вдалбливают им смолоду, они и метемпсихозят. Будто бы мы живем после смерти. Души наши. Будто душа человека, когда он умрет. Дигнама вот душа Ты ее уже кончила?  спросил он. Да,  сказала она.  Совсем никакой клубнички. Она что, все время любила того, первого? Я даже не заглядывал. Хочешь другую? Ага. Принеси еще Поль де Кока[]. Такое симпатичное имя[].Она подлила себе чаю, глядя сбоку на струйку.Надо продлить ту книжку из библиотеки на Кейпл-стрит, а то напишут Карни, моему поручителю. Перевоплощение: вот то самое слово. Некоторые верят,  начал он,  что после смерти мы будем снова жить в другом теле и что уже жили раньше. Это называется перевоплощение. Что все мы уже жили раньше, тысячи лет назад, на земле или на какой-нибудь другой планете. Они считают, мы забыли про это. А некоторые говорят, будто помнят свои прошлые жизни.Густые сливки вились витками у нее в чашке. Как бы ей лучше запомнить это слово: метемпсихоз. Хорошо бы пример. Пример.Над кроватью Купанье нимфы. Приложение к пасхальному номеру Фотокартинок: роскошный шедевр, великолепные краски. Как чай до того как налили молока. Похожа на нее с распущенными волосами, только потоньше. За рамку отдано три и шесть. Она сказала: над кроватью будет красиво.Обнаженные нимфы  Греция  а вот и пример  все люди, что тогда жили.Он перелистал страницы обратно. Метемпсихоз,  сказал он,  так это называли древние греки. Они верили, что человек может превратиться в животное или, скажем, в дерево.Что они называли нимфами, например.Она перестала вдруг помешивать ложечкой. Смотрела прямо перед собой и втягивала воздух округлившимися ноздрями. Горелым пахнет,  сказала она.  У тебя там ничего на огне? Почка!  возопил он.Он сунул не глядя книжку во внутренний карман и, стукнувшись носком ноги о хромой комод, ринулся на запах, сбегая по лестнице прыжками всполошенного аиста. Пахучий дым поднимался сердитой струйкой с одного края сковороды. Поддев почку вилкой, он отодрал ее и перевернул, как на спину черепаху. Совсем чуть-чуть подгорела. Он перебросил ее на тарелку и полил оставшимся бурым соком.Теперь чайку. Он уселся, отрезал ломоть хлеба, намазал маслом. Срезал пригорелую мякоть и бросил кошке. Наконец, отправил кусочек на вилке в рот и принялся жевать, разборчиво смакуя упругое аппетитное мясо. В самый раз.Глоток чаю. Потом он нарезал хлеб на кубики, обмакнул один в соус и сунул в рот. Так что там у нее про студента и про пикник? Он разложил около себя листок с письмом и медленно стал читать, жуя, макая кубики в соус и отправляя их в рот.Дражайший папулька,Преогромнейшее спасибо за твой чудный подарочек ко дню рождения. Он мне дивно идет. Все говорят, что в новой беретке я просто неотразима. Получила от мамочки чудную коробку со сливочными тянучками, пишу ей отдельно.Конфетки  дивные. А я тут зарылась с головой в фотографию. Мистер Коклан снял меня вместе со своей мадам, когда проявим, пришлю. Вчера тут была сплошная запарка. Погожий денек, и все толстомясые припожаловали. В понедельник хотим устроить пикничок небольшой компанией на озере Оул.Спасибо тебе еще раз и тысяча поцелуев, а мамочке скажи, я ее ужасно люблю. Внизу играют на пианино. В субботу будет концерт в отеле Гревильский герб. Сюда по вечерам иногда заходит один студент, его фамилия Баннон, и у него какие-то родственники ужасные богачи, и он исполняет эту песенку Бойлана (чуть-чуть не написала Буяна Бойлана) о приморских красотках. Передай ему от меня, что Милли-глупышка ему шлет привет. Пора кончать письмо, с любовьютвоя любящая дочь, Милли... Извини за каракули, очень спешу. Пока. М.Пятнадцать вчера. Как сошлось, и число пятнадцатое. Первый день рождения в чужих местах. Разлука. Помню летнее утро, когда она родилась.Помчался за миссис Торнтон на Дензилл-стрит. Бодрая старушка. Куче младенцев помогла явиться на свет. Она с первой минуты знала: бедняжке Руди не жить. Авось Бог милостив, сэр. А сама уже знала. Остался бы жить, сейчас было бы одиннадцать.Отсутствующим печальным взглядом он смотрел на постскриптум. Извини за каракули. Спешу. Внизу пианино. Выпорхнула из гнезда. Сцена с ней из-за браслета в кафе . Не стала есть пирожные, не глядела, не разговаривала. Дерзкая девчонка. Он обмакнул в соус еще кубик хлеба, машинально продолжая доедать почку. Двенадцать и шесть в неделю. Не густо.Но могло и похуже быть. Мюзик-холл, скажем. Студент. Он глотнул остывшего чаю, запить еду Потом опять перечел письмо: дважды.Ну ладно, она умеет вести себя осмотрительно. А вдруг нет? Оставь, ничего еще не случилось. Все возможно, конечно. Во всяком случае, обождем.Бесенок. Вечно бегом по лестнице, ножки тонкие, стройные. Судьба.Наступает зрелость. Кокетка  страшная.Он улыбнулся в кухонное окно с теплотой, с тревогой. Однажды вижу ее на улице: щиплет себя за щеки, чтоб разрумянились. Слегка малокровная. Поздно отняли от груди. В тот день на Короле Эрина[] вокруг маяка Киш. Старую посудину качало вовсю. А ей хоть бы что. Шарф по ветру, светло-голубой, распущенные волосы по ветру.Щечки в ямочках, кудряшкиВскружат голову бедняжке.Приморские красотки. Распечатанный конверт. Руки в брюки и распевает, ни дать ни взять извозчик навеселе. Друг дома. Вскрюжат , он так поет.Освещенный пирс, летний вечер, звуки оркестра.До чего ж милы и кроткиТе приморские красотки.И Милли тоже. Первые юные поцелуи. Как давно минуло. Миссис Мэрион.Сейчас снова легла, читает, перебирая прядки волос, заплетая их, улыбаясь.Сожаление и потерянность, нарастая, смутной волной расползались вниз по спине. Да, случится. Помешать. Бесполезно: что сделаешь! Девичьи губы, нежные, легкие. Случится то же. Он чувствовал, как волна потерянности охватывает его. Бесполезно тут что-то делать. Губы целуют, целующие, целуемые. Женские губы, полные, клейкие.Лучше пусть там, где она сейчас: подальше. И занята. Хотела собаку от нечего делать. Можно бы туда съездить. На табельные дни в августе, всего два и шесть в оба конца. Но это через полтора месяца. Можно бы устроить бесплатный проезд, как журналисту. Или через Маккоя.Кошка, вылизав свою шерстку, вернулась к обертке в кровяных пятнах, потыкала ее носом и пошла к двери. Оглянулась на него, мяукнула. Хочет выйти. Жди перед дверью  когда-нибудь отворится. Пусть подождет. Как-то занервничала. Электричество. Гроза в воздухе. И умывала ушко спиной к огню.Он ощутил сытую тяжесть  потом легкие позывы в желудке. Поднялся из-за стола, распуская брючный ремень. Кошка настойчиво мяукнула. Мяу,  передразнил он.  Обождешь, пока я сам соберусь.Тяжесть: день будет жаркий. Лень подыматься на площадку по лестнице.Газетку. В сортире он любил читать. Надеюсь, никакая макака туда не забредет, пока я.В ящике стола ему попался старый номер Осколков. Свернув, он сунул его под мышку, подошел к двери и отворил. Кошка кинулась мягкими прыжками наверх. А, вон ты куда  свернуться на постели клубком.Прислушавшись, он услыхал ее голос: Поди сюда, кисонька. Ну поди.Он вышел с черного хода во двор; постоял, прислушиваясь к звукам соседнего двора. Все тихо. Может быть, вешают белье. Королевна в парке[] вешает белье. Славное утро.Он наклонился взглянуть на чахлые кустики мяты, посаженной вдоль стены.Поставить беседку здесь. Бобы, дикий виноград. И надо везде удобрить, земля плохая. Бурая корка серы. Почва всегда такая без навоза. Кухонные помои. Перегной  что бы это за штука? У соседей куры: вот их помет  отличное удобрение. Но самое лучшее от скота, особенно если кормили жмыхами. Сухой навоз. Лучшее средство для чистки лайковых перчаток. Грязь очищает. И зола. Надо тут все переделать. В том углу горох. Салат. Всегда будет свежая зелень. Но с этими садиками свои неудобства. Тот шмель или овод в Духов день.Он двинулся по дорожке. А где моя шляпа, кстати? Должно быть, повесил обратно на крючок. Или оставил наверху. Вот номер, совсем не помню. На вешалке в прихожей слишком полно. Четыре зонтика, ее плащ. Подбирал письма. У Дрейго колокольчик звонил. Как странно, именно в этот момент я думал. Его волосы, каштановые, напомаженные, над воротничком. Свежевымыт и свежепричесан. Не знаю, успею ли зайти в баню. Тара-стрит. Тип, что у них за кассой, устроил побег Джеймсу Стивенсу[]. Такие слухи. ОБрайен.Каким он басом говорит, этот Длугач. Агенда  как там? Пожалте, мисс.Энтузиаст.Он отворил, толкнув носком, ветхую дверь сортира. Смотри, чтобы не запачкать брюки, потом на похороны. Вошел, пригнув голову, стараясь не задеть о низкий косяк. Оставив дверь приоткрытой, посреди пыльной паутины и вони заплесневелой хлорки, не спеша, отстегнул подтяжки. Перед тем как усесться, бросил через щель взгляд на соседское окно. А король на троне пишет манифест. Никого нет.Раскорячившись на позорном стуле, он развернул журнал на оголенных коленях и стал читать. Что-нибудь новенькое и полегче. Не торопись особо.Попридержи. Наш премированный осколок: Мастерский удар Мэтчена. Автор  мистер Филип Бьюфой, член лондонского Клуба театралов. Гонорар по гинее за столбец. Три с половиной. Три фунта три. Три фунта тринадцать и шесть.Он мирно прочел, сдерживая себя, первый столбец, затем, уступая, но еще придерживая, начал второй. На середине, окончательно уступив, он дал кишечнику опорожниться свободно, продолжая мирно, неторопливо читать, вчерашний легкий запор прошел без следа. Авось не слишком толсто, геморрой снова не разойдется. Нет, самый раз. Ага. Уфф! Для страдающих запором: одна таблетка святой коры. В жизни может такое быть. Это не тронуло и не взволновало его, но, в общем, было бойко и живо. Теперь что хочешь печатают. На безрыбье. Он читал дальше, спокойно сидя над своими подымавшимися миазмами. Бойко, что говорить. Мэтчен часто вспоминает свой мастерский удар, покоривший сердце смеющейся чаровницы, которая ныне.Мораль в конце и в начале. Рука об руку[]. Лихо. Он снова окинул взглядом прочитанное и, выпуская ровную заключительную струю, благодушно позавидовал мистеру Бьюфою, который сочинил это и получил гонорар в размере трех фунтов тринадцати шиллингов и шести пенсов.Я б тоже мог кое-что накропать. Авторы  мистер и миссис Л.М.Блум.Придумать историйку на тему пословицы. Какой только? Как-то пробовал записывать на манжете, что она говорит, пока собирается. Не люблю собираться вместе. Порезался, бреясь. Покусывает нижнюю губку, застегивая крючки на платье. Я засекаю время. :. Робертс тебе заплатил уже? :. А в чем была Грета Конрой[]? :. Чего меня угораздило купить такую гребенку? :. С этой капусты меня всегда пучит. Заметит пылинки на обуви  потрет каждую туфельку об чулки на икрах, обе по очереди, так ловко.Наутро после благотворительного бала, когда оркестр Мэя исполнял танец часов Понкьелли[]. Объяснял ей: утренние часы, потом день, вечер, потом ночные часы. Она чистила зубы. Это была первая встреча. У нее голова кружилась. Пощелкивали пластинки веера. А этот Бойлан богатый? Да, он со средствами. А что? Я во время танца заметила, у него пахнет чем-то приятным изо рта. Тогда не стоит мурлыкать. Надо бы намекнуть. В последний раз какая-то странная музыка. Зеркало было в темноте. Она взяла свое маленькое, потерла о кофточку на грудях, нервно, так и заколыхались. Потом смотрелась. Нахмуренный взгляд. Чего-то там такое не сладилось.Вечерние часы, девушки в серых газовых платьях. Потом ночные часы в черном, с кинжалами, в полумасках. Это поэтично, розовое, потом золотое, потом серое, потом черное. И в то же время как в жизни. День, потом ночь.Он смело оторвал половину премированного рассказа и подтерся ею. Потом поднял брюки, застегнул, надел подтяжки. Потянул на себя кривую шаткую дверь сортира и вышел из полумрака на воздух.При ярком свете, облегченный и освеженный в членах, он тщательно осмотрел свои черные брюки, их обшлага, колени и за коленями. Во сколько похороны? Надо уточнить по газете.Мрачные скрипучие звуки высоко в воздухе. Колокола церкви святого Георгия. Они отбивали время: гулкий мрачный металл.Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Без четверти. Потом снова: по воздуху донесся обертон, терция.Бедный Дигнам!Эпизод []По набережной сэра Джона Роджерсона шагал собранным шагом мистер Блум: мимо ломовых подвод, мимо маслобойни Лиска (льняное масло, жмыхи), мимо Уиндмилл-лейн и мимо почтово-телеграфного отделения. На этот адрес тоже было бы можно. И мимо богадельни для моряков. С шумливой утренней набережной он повернул на Лайм-стрит. У коттеджей Брэди шатался мальчишка-свалочник, примкнув ведерко с требухой, сосал жеваный окурок.Девчонка помладше, с изъеденным коростой лбом, глазела на него, вяло придерживая ржавый обруч. Сказать ему, если курит  перестанет расти. Да ладно, оставь в покое! И так житье у него не рай. Ждать у трактира, тащить папашу домой. Тять, ну пойдем, мамка ждет. Как раз затишье: не будет много народу. Он перешел Таунсенд-стрит, миновал хмурый фасад Бетеля[]. Да, Эль.Его дом: Алеф, Бет. Потом похоронное бюро Николса. В одиннадцать. Времени хватит. Ей-ей, Корни Келлехер подкинул эту работенку ОНилу. Напевает, прикрыв глаза. Корни. Повстречал я в темном парке. Одну пташку. Возле арки. Работает на полицию. Свое имя мне сказала и мои труляля труляля там там. Ясное дело, он подкинул. Схороните-ка по дешевке в сухом-немазаном. И мои труляля труляля труляля труляля.На Уэстленд-роу он остановился перед витриной Белфастской и Восточной чайной компании, прочел ярлыки на пачках в свинцовой фольге: отборная смесь, высшее качество, семейный чай. Жарко становится. Чай. Надо бы им разжиться у Тома Кернана[]. Хотя похороны  неподходящий случай. Покуда глаза его невозмутимо читали, он снял не торопясь шляпу, вдохнув запах своего брильянтина, и плавным неторопливым жестом провел правой рукой по лбу и по волосам. Какое жаркое утро. Глаза из-под приспущенных век отыскали чуть заметную выпуклость на кожаном ободке внутри его шляпы-лю.Вот она. Правая рука погрузилась в тулью. Пальцы живо нащупали за ободком карточку, переместили в карман жилета.До того жарко. Правая рука еще раз еще неторопливей поднялась и прошлась: отборная смесь, из лучших цейлонских сортов. На дальнем востоке.Должно быть, чудесный уголок: сад мира[], огромные ленивые листья, на них можно плавать, кактусы, лужайки в цветах, деревья-змеи, как их называют.Интересно, там вправду так? Сингалезы валяются на солнышке, в   [], за целый день пальцем не шевельнут.Шесть месяцев в году спят. Слишком жарко для ссор. Влияние климата.Летаргия. Цветы праздности[]. Главная пища  воздух. Азот. Теплицы в Ботаническом саду. Хрупкие растения, водяные лилии. Листья истомились без.Сонная болезнь в воздухе. Ходишь по розовым лепесткам. Навернуть рубцов, студню, это и в голову не взбредет. Тот малый на картинке, в каком же он месте был? Ах да, на мертвом море, лежит себе на спине, читает газету под зонтиком. При всем желании не утонешь: столько там соли. Потому что вес воды, нет, вес тела в воде равен весу, весу чего же? Или объем равен весу?Какой то закон такой, Вэнс нас учил в школе. Вечно крутил пальцами. Учение и кручение. А что это, в самом деле, вес? Тридцать два фута в секунду за секунду. Закон падения тел: в секунду за секунду. Все они падают на землю.Земля. Сила земного тяготения, вот это что такое, вес.Он повернулся и неспешно перешел через улицу. Как это она вышагивала с сосисками? Примерно так вот. На ходу он вынул из бокового кармана сложенный Фримен, развернул его, скатал в трубку по длине и начал похлопывать себя по брюкам при каждом неспешном шаге. Беззаботный вид: заглянул просто так. В секунду за секунду. Это значит в секунду на каждую секунду. С тротуара он метнул цепкий взгляд в двери почты. Ящик для опоздавших писем. Опускать сюда. Никого. Пошел.Он протянул свою карточку через медную решетку. Нет ли для меня писем?  спросил он.Пока почтовая барышня смотрела в ячейке, он разглядывал плакат вербовочной службы: солдаты всех родов войск на параде; и, держа конец своей трубки у самых ноздрей, вдыхал запах свежей типографской краски.Нет, наверно, ответа. В последний раз зашел слишком далеко.Барышня сквозь решетку подала ему карточку и письмо. Он поблагодарил, бросив быстрый взгляд на конверт, заадресованный на машинке:ЗдесьПочтовое Отделение Уэстленд-роу, до востребованияГенри Флауэру[], эсквайру.Ответила все-таки. Сунув письмо и карточку в боковой карман, он вернулся к параду всех родов войск. А где тут полк старины Твиди?Отставной вояка. Вон они: медвежьи шапки с султаном. Нет, он же гренадер.Остроконечные обшлага. Вот: королевские дублинские стрелки. Красные мундиры. Эффектно. Потому женщины за ними и бегают. Военная форма. Легче и вербовать и муштровать. Письмо Мод Гонн[], чтобы их не пускали по вечерам на ОКоннелл-стрит: позор для столицы Ирландии. Сейчас газета Гриффита трубит о том же[]: армия, где кишат венерические болезни, империя Венерия. Какой-то вид у них недоделанный: как будто одурманенные. Смирно. Равняйсь. Сено-солома. Сено  солома. Полк Его Величества. А вот форму пожарника или полисмена он никогда не наденет[]. Масон, да.Беспечной походкой он вышел с почты и повернул направо. Говорильня; как будто этим что-то исправишь. Рука его опустилась в карман; указательный палец просунулся под клапан конверта и вскрыл его несколькими рывками. Не думаю, чтобы женщины особо обращали внимание. Пальцы вытащили письмо и скомкали в кармане конверт. Что-то подколото: наверно, фотография. Прядь волос? Нет.Маккой. Как бы поскорей отвязаться. Одна помеха. Чужое присутствие только злит, когда ты. Здравствуйте, Блум. Куда направляетесь? Здравствуйте, Маккой. Да так, никуда. Как самочувствие? Прекрасно. А вы как? Скрипим помаленьку,  сказал Маккой.Бросая взгляд на черный костюм и галстук, он спросил, почтительно понизив голос: А что-нибудь надеюсь, ничего не случилось? Я вижу, вы Нет-нет,  сказал Блум.  Это Дигнам, бедняга. Сегодня похороны. Ах да, верно. Печальная история. А в котором часу?Нет, и не фотография. Какой-то значок, что ли. В оди одиннадцать,  ответил мистер Блум. Я попытаюсь выбраться,  сказал Маккой.  В одиннадцать, вы говорите? Я узнал только вчера вечером. Кто же мне сказал? А, Холохан[]. Прыгунчик, знаете? Знаю.Мистер Блум смотрел через улицу на кэб, стоявший у подъезда отеля Гровнор. Швейцар поставил чемодан между сиденьями. Она спокойно стояла в ожидании, а мужчина, муж, брат, похож на нее, искал мелочь в карманах.Пальто модного фасона, с круглым воротником, слишком теплое для такой погоды, на вид как байка. Стоит в небрежной позе, руки в карманы, накладные, сейчас так носят. Как та надменная дамочка на игре в поло. Все женщины свысока, пока не раскусишь. Красив телом красив и делом.Неприступны до первого приступа. Достойная госпожа и Брут весьма достойный человек[]. Разок ее поимеешь, спеси как не бывало. Я был с Бобом Дореном[], он снова сейчас в загуле, и с этим, как же его, с Бэнтамом Лайонсом[]. Да мы тут рядом и были, у Конвея.Дорен Лайонс у Конвея. Она поднесла к волосам руку в перчатке. И тут заходит Прыгунчик. Под мухой. Немного откинув голову и глядя вдаль из-под приспущенных век, он видел заплетенные крендельки, видел, как сверкает на солнце ярко-желтая кожа. Как ясно сегодня видно. Может быть, из-за влажности. Болтает о том о сем. Ручка леди. С какой стороны она будет садиться? И говорит: Грустная весть насчет бедного нашего друга Падди! Какого Падди? Это я говорю. Бедняжечки Падди Дигнама , это он говорит.За город едут  наверно, через Бродстоун. Высокие коричневые ботинки, кончики шнурков свисают. Изящная ножка. Чего он все возится с этой мелочью? А она видит, что я смотрю. Всегда примечают, если кто клюнул. На всякий случай. Запас беды не чинит. А что такое? я говорю. Чего это с ним стряслось? говорю.Надменная  богатая  чулки шелковые. Ага,  сказал мистер Блум.Он отодвинулся слегка вбок от говорящей Маккоевой головы. Будет сейчас садиться. Чего стряслось? говорит. Помер он, вот чего . И, мать честная, тут же наливает себе. Как, Падди Дигнам ? Это я говорю. Я просто ушам своим не поверил. Я же с ним был еще в прошлую пятницу, нет, в четверг, в Радуге мы сидели. Да , говорит. Покинул он нас. Скончался в понедельник, сердяга .Гляди! Гляди! Шелк сверкнул, чулки дорогие белые. Гляди!Неуклюжий трамвай, трезвоня в звонок, вклинился, заслонил.Пропало. Чтоб сам ты пропал, курносая рожа. Чувство как будто выставили за дверь. Рай и пери[]. Вот всегда так. В самый момент. Девица в подворотне на Юстейс-стрит. Кажется, в понедельник было, поправляла подвязку. Рядом подружка, прикрывала спектакль.   []. Ну что, что вылупился? Да-да,  промолвил мистер Блум с тяжким вздохом.  Еще один нас покинул. Один из лучших,  сказал Маккой.Трамвай проехал. Они уже катили в сторону Окружного моста, ручка ее в дорогой перчатке на стальном поручне. Сверк-блеск  поблескивала на солнце эгретка на ее шляпе  блеск-сверк. Супруга жива-здорова, надеюсь?  спросил Маккой, сменив тон. О да,  отвечал мистер Блум,  спасибо, все в лучшем виде.Он рассеянно развернул газетную трубку и рассеянно прочитал:Как живется в доме Без паштетов Сливи?Тоскливо.А с ними жизнь словно рай. Моя дражайшая как раз получила ангажемент. То есть, уже почти.Опять насчет чемодана закидывает[]. И что, пусть. Меня больше не проведешь.Мистер Блум приветливо и неторопливо обратил на него свои глаза с тяжелыми веками. Моя жена тоже,  сказал он.  Она должна петь в каком-то сверхшикарном концерте в Белфасте, в Ольстер-холле, двадцать пятого. Вот как?  сказал Маккой.  Рад это слышать, старина. А кто это все устраивает?Миссис Мэрион Блум. Еще не вставала. Королева в спальне хлеб с вареньем. Не за книгой. Замусоленные карты, одни картинки, разложены по семеркам вдоль бедра. На темную даму и светлого короля. Кошка пушистым черным клубком. Полоска распечатанного конверта.Эта стараяСладкаяПесняЛюбвиРаз да-ется Видите ли, это нечто вроде турне,  задумчиво сказал мистер Блум.  Песня любви . Образован комитет, при равном участии в прибылях и расходах.Маккой кивнул, пощипывая жесткую поросль усиков. Понятно,  произнес он.  Это приятная новость.Он собрался идти. Что же, рад был увидеть вас в добром здравии,  сказал он.  Встретимся как-нибудь. Конечно,  сказал мистер Блум. Знаете еще что,  решился Маккой.  Вы не могли бы меня вписать в список присутствующих на похоронах? Я бы хотел быть сам, только, возможно, не получится. В Сэндикоуве кто-то утонул, и может так выйти, что мне со следователем придется туда поехать, если тело найдут. А вы просто вставьте мое имя, если меня не будет, хорошо? Я это сделаю,  сказал мистер Блум, собираясь двигаться.  Все будет в порядке. Отлично,  сказал бодро Маккой.  Большое спасибо, старина. Может, я еще и приду. Ну, пока. Просто Ч.П. Маккой, и сойдет. Будет исполнено,  твердо пообещал мистер Блум.Не вышло меня обойти. А подбивал клинья. На простачка. Но я себе на уме. К этому чемодану у меня своя слабость. Кожа. Наугольники, клепаные края, замок с предохранителем и двойной защелкой. В прошлом году Боб Каули ему одолжил свой, для концерта на регате в Уиклоу, и с тех пор о чемоданчике ни слуху ни духу.С усмешкою на лице мистер Блум неспешно шагал в сторону Брансвик-стрит.Моя дражайшая как раз получила. Писклявое сопрано в веснушках. Нос огрызком. Не без приятности, в своем роде: для небольшого романса. Но жидковато. Вы да я, мы с вами, не правда ли? Как бы на равных. Подлиза.Противно делается. Что он, не слышит разницы? Кажется, он слегка таков. Не по мне это. Я так и думал, Белфаст его заденет. Надеюсь, в тех краях с оспой не стало хуже. А то вдруг откажется еще раз делать прививку. Ваша жена и моя жена.Интересно, а он за мной не следит?Мистер Блум стоял на углу, глаза его блуждали по красочным рекламным плакатам. Имбирный эль (ароматизированный), фирма Кантрелл и Кокрейн.Летняя распродажа у Клери. Нет, пошел прямо. Всех благ. Сегодня Лия[]: миссис Бэндмен Палмер[]. Хотелось бы еще раз посмотреть ее в этой роли.Вчера играла в Гамлете. Мужская роль. А может, он был женщина[]. Почему Офелия и покончила с собой. Бедный папа! Так часто рассказывал про Кейт Бейтмен[] в этой роли! Простоял целый день у театра Адельфи в Лондоне, чтобы попасть. Это за год до моего рождения: в шестьдесят пятом. А в Вене Ристори[]. Как же она правильно называется? Пьеса Мозенталя. Рахиль[]? Нет.Всегда говорил про ту сцену, где старый ослепший Авраам узнает голос и ощупывает его лицо пальцами. Голос Натана! Голос сына его! Я слышу голос Натана, который оставил отца своего умирать от горя и нищеты на моих руках, и оставил дом отчий, и оставил Бога отцов своих.Здесь каждое слово, Леопольд, полно глубокого смысла.Бедный папа! Бедный! Хорошо, что я не пошел в комнату и не видел его лицо. В тот день! Боже! Боже! Эх! Кто знает, быть может, так было лучше для него.Мистер Блум завернул за угол, прошел мимо понурых одров на извозчичьей стоянке. Что толку об этом думать. Пора для торбы с овсом. Лучше бы я не встретил его, этого Маккоя.Он подошел ближе, услышал хруст золоченого овса, жующие мирно челюсти.Их выпуклые оленьи глаза смотрели на него, когда он шел мимо, среди сладковатой овсяной вони лошадиной мочи. Их Эльдорадо. Бедные саврасы!Плевать им на все, уткнули длинные морды в свои торбы, знать ничего не знают и забот никаких. Слишком сыты, чтоб разговаривать. И корм и кров обеспечены. Холощеные: черный обрубок болтается, как резиновый, между ляжками. Что ж, может, они и так счастливы. На вид славная, смирная животинка. Но как примутся ржать, это бывает невыносимо.Он вынул из кармана письмо и положил в газету, которую нес. Можно здесь натолкнуться на нее. В переулке надежней.Он миновал Приют извозчика. Странная у извозчика жизнь, туда-сюда, в любую погоду, в любое место, на время или в один конец, все не по своей воле.   . Люблю иногда их угостить сигареткой. Общительны. Катит мимо, покрикивает на лету. Он замурлыкал:    Ла ла дала ла ла.Он повернул на Камберленд-стрит и, пройдя несколько шагов, остановился под стеной станции. Никого. Лесосклад Мида. Кучи досок. Развалины и хибарки. Осторожно пересек клетки классиков, в одной  позабытый камушек.Не сгорел. Возле склада мальчик на корточках играл один в шарики, посылая главный щелчком большого пальца. Пестрая и мудрая кошка, моргающий сфинкс, смотрела со своей нагретой приступки. Жалко их беспокоить. Магомет отрезал кусок своего плаща, чтобы не разбудить[]. Вынимай. Я тоже играл в шарики, когда ходил в школу к той старой даме. Она любила резеду. Миссис Эллис. А мистер где? Он развернул письмо под прикрытием газеты.Цветок. Кажется, это  Желтый цветочек с расплющенными лепестками.Значит, не рассердилась? Чего она там пишет?Дорогой Генри!Я получила твое письмо, очень тебе благодарна за него. Жаль, что мое последнее письмо тебе не понравилось. И зачем ты вложил марки? Я на тебя так сердилась. Ужасно хочется, чтобы я могла как-нибудь тебя проучить за это. Я назвала тебя противным мальчишкой, потому что мне совершенно не нравится тот свет. Пожалуйста, объясни мне, что этот твой совет означает?Так ты несчастлив в семейной жизни, мой бедненький противный мальчишка?Ужасно хочется, чтобы я могла чем-нибудь помочь тебе. Напиши мне, пожалуйста, что ты думаешь про меня, бедняжку. Я часто думаю о твоем имени, оно такое красивое. Генри, милый, а когда мы встретимся? Ты просто представить себе не можешь, как часто я о тебе думаю. У меня никогда еще не было такой привязанности к мужчине. Я так страдаю. Пожалуйста, напиши мне длинное письмо, расскажи мне побольше. И помни, если ты этого не сделаешь, я тебя проучу. Вот, знай теперь, что я тебе сделаю, противный мальчишка, если ты не напишешь. Я так мечтаю, чтобы мы встретились. Генри, милый, исполни эту мою просьбу, пока у меня еще есть терпение. Тогда я скажу тебе все. А сейчас я с тобой прощаюсь, мой противный, мой миленький.У меня сегодня ужасно болит голова и напиши поскорее тоскующей по тебе Марте... Напиши мне, какими духами душится твоя жена. Я хочу знать.С глубокомысленным видом он отколол цветок от бумаги, понюхал его почти исчезнувший запах и положил в кармашек у сердца. Язык цветов. Им это нравится, потому что нельзя подслушать. Или отравленный букет, разделаться с ним. Шагая медленно дальше, он перечел еще раз письмо, шепча отдельные слова про себя. Сердились тюльпаны на тебя миленький мужецвет проучить твой кактус если ты пожалуйста бедняжка незабудка я так мечтаю фиалки мой милый розы когда же мы анемоны встретимся противный ночной пестик жена духи Марте[]. Он перечел до конца, вынул его из газеты и спрятал обратно в боковой карман.Тихая радость приоткрыла его губы. Не сравнить с первым письмом.Интересно, сама писала? Разыгрывает возмущение: я девушка из хорошей семьи, пример добродетели. Могли бы встретиться в воскресенье после мессы.Большое спасибо  не по моей части. Обычная любовная драчка. Потом разбегутся по углам. Не лучше, чем сцены с Молли. Сигара успокаивает.Наркотик. В следующий раз пойти еще дальше. Противный мальчишка, проучить: боится слов, конечно. Что-нибудь шокирующее, а? Стоит попробовать. Каждый раз понемножку.Продолжая ощупывать письмо в кармане, он вытащил из него булавку.Простая булавка? Он бросил ее на землю. Откуда-нибудь из одежды: что-то закалывала. Это немыслимо, сколько на них булавок. Нет розы без шипов.Грубые дублинские голоса взвыли у него в голове. В ту ночь в Куме, две девки, обнявшись под дождем:Эх, у Мэри панталоны на одной булавке.А булавка упадет -Как домой она дойдет,Как домой она дойдет?Кто? Мэри. Ужасно болит голова. Наверно, их месячные розы. Или целый день за машинкой. Вредно для нервов желудка. Зрительное напряжение. Какими духами душится твоя жена? Додумалась, а?Как домой она дойдет?Марта, Мэри. Мария и Марфа. Где-то я видел эту картину, забыл уже, старого мастера или подделка. Он сидит у них в доме, разговаривает[].Таинственно. Те девки из Кума тоже слушали бы.Как домой она дойдет?Приятное вечернее чувство. Скитанья кончены. Можешь расслабиться  мирные сумерки  пусть все идет своим чередом. Забудь. Рассказывай о тех местах, где ты был, о чужих обычаях. Другая, с кувшином на голове, готовила ужин: фрукты, маслины, прохладная вода из колодца, хладнокаменного, как дырка в стене в Эштауне[]. В следующий раз, как пойду на бега, надо будет прихватить бумажный стаканчик. Она слушает с расширенными глазами, темные ласковые глаза. Рассказывай  еще и еще  все расскажи. И потом вздох: молчание. Долгий  долгий  долгий покой.Проходя под железнодорожным мостом, он вынул конверт, проворно изорвал на клочки и пустил по ветру. Клочки разлетелись, быстро падая вниз в сыром воздухе: белая стайка, потом все попадали.Генри Флауэр. Вот так можно разорвать и чек на сто фунтов. Простой листик бумаги. Лорд Айви явился как-то в Ирландский банк с семизначным чеком, получил миллион наличными. Вот и смотри, что можно взять на портере. Зато другой братец, лорд Ардилон, говорят, должен менять рубашку четыре раза на день[]. Какие-то вши, не то черви. Миллион фунтов, минутку.Два пенса  это пинта, четыре  кварта, значит, галлон портера восемь пенсов, хотя нет, шиллинг четыре пенса. Двадцать поделить на один и четыре: примерно пятнадцать. Так, точно. Пятнадцать миллионов бочонков портера.Что я говорю, бочонков? Галлонов. Но все равно около миллиона бочонков.Прибывающий поезд тяжело пролязгал над головой у него, один вагон за другим. В голове стукались бочонки; плескался и переливался мутный портер.Затычки вылетели, полился мощный мутный поток, растекаясь по грязной земле, петляя, образуя озерки и водовороты хмельной влаги и увлекая с собой широколистые цветы ее пены.Он подошел к отворенным задним дверям церкви Всех Святых. Ступив на крыльцо, снял шляпу, вытащил из кармана визитную карточку и снова засунул ее за кожаный ободок. Тьфу ты. Ведь мог прощупать Маккоя насчет бесплатного проезда в Моллингар.Прежнее объявление на дверях. Проповедь высокопреподобного Джона Конми[] О.И.[], о святом Петре Клавере О.И. и об африканской миссии. Спасать миллионы китайцев. Как они ухитряются это растолковать косоглазым. Те предпочли бы унцию опиума. Жители Небесной Империи. Для них первейшая ересь. За обращение Гладстона[] молились, когда был уже почти в беспамятстве. Протестанты такие же. Обратить в истинную веру Вильяма Дж.Уолша, доктора Богословия. Ихний бог  Будда, что на боку в музее лежит[]. Подложил руку под голову, прохлаждается. Возжигают курения.Непохоже на  []. Терновый венец и крест.Трилистник  хорошая придумка святого Патрика[]. А едят палочками? Конми:Мартин Каннингем[] с ним знаком: почтенного вида. Надо было к нему пойти, когда устраивал Молли в хор, а не к этому отцу Фарли, что на вид простачок, а на самом деле. Так учат их. Уж этот не отправится крестить негритят: пот ручьями, солнечные очки. А те дивились бы на очки, как сверкают. Забавно бы поглядеть, как они там сидят в кружок, развесив толстые губищи, и в полном восторге слушают. Натюрморт. Лакают, как молочко.Прохладный запах святых камней влек его. Он поднялся по истертым ступеням, толкнул дверь и тихонько вошел.Что то тут делается: служба какой-то общины. Жаль, что так пусто.Отличное укромное местечко, где бы пристроиться рядом с приятной девушкой.Кто мой ближний[]? Часами в тесноте, под тягучую музыку. Та женщина у вечерней мессы. На седьмом небе. Женщины стали на колени у своих скамей, опустив головы, вокруг шей алые ленточки[]. Часть стала на колени у алтарной решетки. Священник обходил их, шепотом бормоча, держа в руках эту штуку.Возле каждой он останавливался, вынимал причастие, стряхивал одну-две капли (они что, в воде?) и аккуратненько клал ей в рот. Ее шляпа и голова дернулись вниз. К следующей: маленькая старушка. Священник наклонился, чтобы положить его ей в рот, все время продолжая шептать. Латынь. К следующей. Закрой глаза, открой рот. Что? []. Тело.Труп. Хорошая находка, латынь. Первым делом их одурманить. Приют для умирающих. Кажется, они это не жуют: сразу глотают. Дикая идея  есть куски трупа. То-то каннибалы клюют на это.Он стоял чуть поодаль, глядя, как их незрячие маски движутся вереницей по проходу, ищут свои места. Потом подошел к скамье и сел с краю, продолжая держать свои газету и шляпу. И что за горшки мы носим. Шляпы надо бы делать по форме головы. Они были рассеяны вокруг, там и сям, головы все еще опущены, алые ленточки, ждут, пока это растопится в их желудках. Вроде мацы, тот же сорт хлеба: пресные хлебы предложения[]. Только посмотреть на них. Так и видно, как счастливы. Конфетка. Счастливы до предела. Да, это называется хлеб ангелов[]. За этим большая идея, чувствуешь что-то в том роде, что Царство Божие внутри нас. Первые причастники. Чудо для крошек леденец за грошик[]. После этого они все чувствуют себя как одна семья, то же самое в театре, все заодно. Конечно, чувствуют, я уверен. Не так одиноко: мы все собратья. Потом в приподнятых чувствах. Дает разрядку.Во что веришь по-настоящему, это и существует. Исцеления в Лурде, воды забвения, явление в Ноке[], кровоточащие статуи. Старикан заснул возле исповедальни. Оттуда и храп. Слепая вера. Обеспечил местечко в грядущем царствии. Убаюкивает все страдания. Разбудите в это же время через год.Он увидел, как священник убрал чашу с причастием куда-то внутрь и на мгновение стал на колени перед ней, выставив серую большую подметку из-под кружевного балахона, что был на нем. А вдруг и у него на одной булавке.Как он домой дойдет? Сзади круглая плешь. На спине буквы. И.Н.Ц.И.[]? Нет: И.Х.С. Молли мне как-то объяснила. Ищу храм святости  или нет: ищу храм страдания, вот как. А те, другие? И нас целиком искупил.Встретиться в воскресенье после мессы. Исполни эту мою просьбу.Появится под вуалью и с черной сумочкой. В сумерках и против света[]. Могла бы быть тут, с ленточкой на шее, и все равно тайком проделывать такие делишки. Они способны. Тот гусь, что выдал непобедимых[], он каждое утро ходил, Кэри его звали, к причастию. Вот в эту самую церковь. Питер Кэри.Нет, это у меня Петр Клавер в голове[]. Дэнис Кэри. Представить только себе.Дома жена и шестеро детей. И все время готовил это убийство. Эти святоши, вот самое подходящее для них слово, в них всегда что-то скользкое. И в делах тоже они виляют. Да нет, ее нет здесь  цветок  нет, нет. А кстати, конверт-то я разорвал? Да-да, под мостом.Священник ополоснул потир, потом залпом ловко опрокинул остатки[]. Вино.Так аристократичней чем если бы он пил что уж они там пьют портер Гиннесса или что-нибудь безалкогольное дублинское горькое Уитли или имбирный эль (ароматизированный) Кантрелла и Кокрейна. Им не дает: вино предложения: только то, другое. Скупятся. Святые мошенники; но правильно делают: иначе бы все пьянчужки сбегались клянчить. Странная атмосфера в этих. Правильно делают. Совершенно правы[].Мистер Блум оглянулся на хоры. Музыки никакой не будет. Жаль. Кто у них органист? Старый Глинн, вот тот умел заставить инструмент говорить, вибрато : по слухам, пятьдесят фунтов в год ему платили на Гардинер-стрит. В тот день Молли была очень в голосе,  [] Россини. Сначала проповедь отца Бернарда Вохена[].Христос или Пилат? Да Христос, только не томи нас всю ночь. Вот музыку они хотели. Шарканье прекратилось. Булавка упадет  слышно. Я ей посоветовал направлять голос в тот угол. Волнение так и чувствовалось в воздухе, на пределе, все даже головы подняли:  []!В этой старой церковной музыке есть чудесные вещи. Меркаданте: семь последних слов[]. Двенадцатая месса Моцарта, а из нее  []. Папы в старину знали толк и в музыке и в искусстве, во всяческих статуях, картинах. Или Палестрина, к примеру. Пока так было, в добрые старые времена, славная была жизнь. И для здоровья полезно, пение, правильный режим, потом варили ликеры. Бенедиктин. Зеленый шартрез. Но все-таки держать в хоре кастратов это уж что-то слишком. А какие это голоса? Наверно, интересно было слушать после их собственных густых басов.Знатоки. Должно быть, они после этого ничего не чувствуют. Некая безмятежность. Не о чем беспокоиться. Жиреют, что им еще? Высокие длинноногие обжоры. Кто знает? Кастрат. Тоже выход из положения.Он увидел, как священник нагнулся и поцеловал алтарь, потом, повернувшись к собравшимся, благословил их. Все перекрестились и встали.Мистер Блум оглянулся по сторонам и тоже встал, глядя поверх поднявшихся шляп. Встают  это конечно для евангелия. Потом все опять стали на колени, а он спокойно уселся на скамью. Священник сошел с алтарного возвышения, держа перед собой предмет, и они с прислужником стали друг другу отвечать по-латыни. Потом священник стал на колени и начал читать по бумажке: Господь наше прибежище и сила нашаМистер Блум подался вперед, чтобы уловить слова. Английский. Бросить им кость. Еще что-то помню. Когда был у мессы последний раз? Преславная и непорочная дева. Супруг ее Иосиф. Петр и Павел. Так интересней, когда понимаешь, о чем все это. Блестящая организация, это факт, работает как часы. Исповедь. Все стремятся. Тогда я скажу тебе все. Раскаяние. Прошу вас, накажите меня. Сильнейшее оружие в их руках. Сильней, чем у доктора или адвоката. Женщины просто с ума сходят. А я шушушушушушу. А вы бубубубубубу? Зачем же это вы? Разглядывает свое кольцо, ищет оправдание.Шепчущая галерея, у стен есть уши. Муж, к своему изумлению, узнает.Господь слегка подшутил. Потом она выходит. Раскаяние на пять минут. Мило пристыжена. Молитва у алтаря. Аве Мария да святая Мария. Цветы, ладан, оплывающие свечи. Прячет румянец. Армия спасения  жалкая подделка. Перед нашим собранием выступит раскаявшаяся блудница. Как я обрела Господа. В Риме, должно быть, головастые парни: это они ведь заправляют всей лавочкой. И денежки хорошие загребают. Завещания: приходскому священнику в его полное распоряжение. Служить мессы за упокой моей души всенародно при открытых дверях. Монастыри мужские и женские. В деле о завещании Ферманы священник в числе свидетелей. Этого не собьешь. Ответ заранее на все готов. Свобода и возвышение нашей святой матери церкви. Учители церкви, они на это придумали целое богословие.Священник молился: Блаженный архангеле Михаиле, огради нас в час бедствий[]. Сохрани нас от злобы и козней диавола (смиренно молим, да укротит его Господь); и властию Божией, о княже воинства небесного, низрини его, сатану, во ад, и с ним купно прочих злых бесов, кои рыщут по свету погибели ради душ наших.Священник с прислужником встали и пошли прочь. Кончено. Женщины еще остались: благодарение.Пора убираться. Брат Обирало. Вдруг пойдет с блюдом. Вноси свою лепту.Он поднялся. Эге. Это что же, две пуговицы на жилете так и были расстегнуты. Женщины в таких случаях в восторге. Никогда не скажут тебе.Любят, когда у тебя слегка растрепанный вид. А уж мы-то. Простите, мисс, тут у вас (гмм!) крохотная (гмм!) пушинка. Или крючок расстегнется сзади на юбке. Проблеск луны[]. Досадуют, если ты не, Что же ты раньше не сказал?Хорошо еще тут, а не дальше к югу. Он прошел меж скамей, незаметно застегиваясь на ходу, и главною дверью вышел на свет. Зажмурясь, он остановился на миг возле холодной черной мраморной чаши, покуда сзади и спереди от него две богомолки окунали робкие руки в мелководье святой воды. Трамваи  фургон из красильни Прескотта  вдовица в трауре. Замечаю, потому что сам в трауре. Он надел шляпу. Сколько там набежало? Четверть?Хватает времени. Стоит сейчас заказать лосьон. Где это? Ах да, в прошлый раз. Свени на Линкольн-плейс. Аптекари редко переезжают. Эти бутыли их зеленые, золотые, не очень сдвинешь. Аптека Гамильтона Лонга основана в год наводнения. Недалеко от гугенотского кладбища. Зайти как-нибудь.Он двинулся в южном направлении по Уэстленд-роу. А ведь рецепт-то в тех брюках. Ох, да и ключ там же. Морока с этими похоронами. Ну ладно, он, бедный, не виноват. Когда я заказывал это дело в последний раз? Постой-ка.Еще, помню, разменял соверен. Должно быть, первого числа или второго. По книге заказов можно найти.Аптекарь перелистывал страницу за страницей назад. От него будто пахнет чем-то песочным, ссохшимся. Сморщенный череп. Старик. Ищут философский камень. Алхимия. Наркотики дают возбуждение, а потом старят. Потом летаргия. А почему? Реакция. Целая жизнь за одну ночь. Характер постепенно меняется. Живешь постоянно среди трав, мазей, лекарств. Все эти алебастровые горшочки. Ступка и пестик. . . . .  [] Уже один запах почти вылечивает, как позвонить в дверь к зубному. Доктор Коновал. Ему бы самому подлечиться. Лечебная кашка или эмульсия. Кто первый решился нарвать травы и лечиться ею, это был храбрый малый. Целебные травы. Нужна осторожность. Тут хватит всего вокруг, чтобы тебя хлороформировать. Проверка: синяя лакмусовая бумажка краснеет.Хлороформ. Чрезмерная доза опия. Снотворное. Приворотные зелья. Парегорик, маковый сироп, вреден при кашле. Закупоривает поры или мокроту. Яды, вот единственные лекарства. Исцеление там, где не ожидаешь. Мудрость природы. Примерно две недели назад, сэр? Да,  ответил мистер Блум.Он ждал у конторки, вдыхая едкую вонь лекарств, сухой пыльный запах губок и люффы. Долгая история выкладывать про свои болячки. Миндальное масло и бензойная настойка,  сказал мистер Блум,  и потом померанцевая водаОт этого лосьона кожа у нее делается нежная и белая, точно воск. И еще воск,  добавил он.Подчеркивает темный цвет глаз. Смотрела на меня, натянув простыню до этих самых глаз, испанских, нюхала себя, пока я продевал запонки. Домашние средства часто самые лучшие: клубника для зубов, крапива и дождевая вода, а еще, говорят, толокно с пахтаньем. Питает кожу. Один из сыновей старой королевы, герцог Олбани, кажется, у него была всего одна кожа[]. Да, у Леопольда. А у всех нас по три. В придачу угри, мозоли и бородавки. Но тебе еще нужно и духи. Какими духами твоя?  []. Тот флердоранж. Чистое ядровое мыло. Вода очень освежает.Приятный у этого мыла запах. Еще успеваю в баню, тут за углом. Хаммам.Турецкая. Массаж. Грязь скапливается в пупке. Приятней, если бы хорошенькая девушка это делала. Да я думаю и я. Да, я. В ванне этим заняться. Странное желание я. Вода к воде. Полезное с приятным. Жалко, нет времени на массаж. Потом весь день чувство свежести. Похороны мраку нагонят. Вот, сэр,  отыскал аптекарь.  Это стоило два и девять. А склянка у вас найдется с собой? Нет,  сказал мистер Блум.  Вы приготовьте, пожалуйста, а я зайду попоздней сегодня. И я возьму еще мыло, какое-нибудь из этих. Они почем? Четыре пенса, сэр.Мистер Блум поднес кусок к носу. Сладковато-лимонный воск. Вот это я возьму,  решил он.  Итого будет три и пенни. Да, сэр,  сказал аптекарь.  Вы можете заплатить за все сразу, когда придете. Хорошо,  сказал мистер Блум.Он вышел из аптеки, не торопясь, держа под мышкой трубку газеты и в левой руке мыло в прохладной обертке.У самой подмышки голос и рука Бэнтама Лайонса сказали: Приветствую, Блум, что новенького? Это сегодняшняя? Вы не покажете на минутку?Фу ты, опять усы сбрил. Длинная, холодная верхняя губа. Чтобы выглядеть помоложе. А выглядит по-дурацки. Он моложе меня.Пальцы Бэнтама Лайонса, желтые, с чернотой под ногтями, развернули газету. Ему бы тоже помыться. Содрать корку грязи. Доброе утро, вы не забыли воспользоваться мылом Пирса? По плечам перхоть. Череп бы смазывал. Хочу взглянуть насчет французской лошадки, что сегодня бежит,  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс.  Черт, да где тут она?Он шелестел мятыми страницами, ерзая подбородком туда-сюда по тугому воротничку. Зуд после бритья. От такого воротничка волосы будут лезть.Оставить ему газету, чтоб отвязался. Можете взять себе,  сказал мистер Блум. Аскот. Золотой кубок. Постойте,  бормотал Бэнтам Лайонс.  Один мо.Максим Второй. Я здесь только рекламу смотрел,  добавил мистер Блум.Внезапно Бэнтам Лайонс поднял на него глаза, в которых мелькнуло хитрое выражение. Как-как вы сказали?  переспросил он отрывисто. Я говорю: можете взять себе,  повторил мистер Блум.  Я все равно хотел выбросить, только посмотрел рекламу.Бэнтам Лайонс с тем же выражением в глазах поколебался минуту  потом сунул раскрытые листы обратно мистеру Блуму. Ладно, рискну,  проговорил он.  Держите, спасибо.Едва не бегом он двинулся в сторону Конвея. Прыть как у зайца.Мистер Блум, усмехнувшись, снова сложил листы аккуратным прямоугольником и поместил между ними мыло. Дурацкие стали губы. Играет на скачках. Последнее время просто повальная зараза. Мальчишки-посыльные воруют, чтобы поставить шесть пенсов. Разыгрывается в лотерею отборная нежная индейка. Рождественский ужин за три пенса. Джек Флеминг играл на казенные деньги, а после сбежал в Америку. Теперь владелец отеля. Назад никогда не возвращаются. Котлы с мясом в земле египетской.Бодрой походкой он приблизился к мечети турецких бань. Напоминает мечеть, красные кирпичи, минареты. Я вижу, сегодня университетские велогонки. Он рассматривал афишу в форме подковы над воротами Колледж-парка: велосипедист, согнувшийся в три погибели. Бездарная афишка.Сделали бы круглую, как колесо. Внутри спицы: гонки  гонки  гонки; а по ободу: университетские. Вот это бы бросалось в глаза.Вон и Хорнблоуэр у ворот. С ним стоит поддерживать: мог бы туда пропускать за так. Как поживаете, мистер Хорнблоуэр? Как поживаете, сэр?Погодка прямо райская. Если бы в жизни всегда так. Погода для крикета.Рассядутся под навесами. Удар за ударом. Промах. Здесь для крикета тесновато. Подряд шесть воротцев. Капитан Буллер пробил по левому краю и вышиб окно в клубе на Килдер-стрит. Таким игрокам место на ярмарке в Доннибруке. Эх, башки мы им открутим, как на поле выйдет Джек[]. Волна тепла. Не слишком надолго. Вечно бегущий поток жизни: ищет в потоке жизни наш взгляд[], что нам доро-о-оже всего.А теперь насладимся баней: чистая ванна с водой, прохладная эмаль, теплый, ласкающий поток. Сие есть тело мое[].Он видел заранее свое бледное тело, целиком погруженное туда, нагое в лоне тепла, умащенное душистым тающим мылом, мягко омываемое. Он видел свое туловище и члены, покрытые струйной рябью, невесомо зависшие, слегка увлекаемые вверх, лимонно-желтые; свой пуп, завязь плоти; и видел, как струятся темные спутанные пряди поросли и струятся пряди потока вокруг поникшего отца тысяч[], вяло колышущегося цветка.Эпизод []Мартин Каннингем, первый, просунул оцилиндренную голову внутрь скрипучей кареты и, ловко войдя, уселся. За ним шагнул мистер Пауэр, пригибаясь из-за своего роста. Садитесь, Саймон. После вас,  сказал мистер Блум.Мистер Дедал надел живо шляпу и поднялся в карету, проговорив: Да-да. Все уже здесь?  спросил Мартин Каннингем.  Забирайтесь, Блум.Мистер Блум вошел и сел на свободное место. Потом взялся за дверцу и плотно притянул ее, пока она не закрылась плотно. Продел руку в петлю и с серьезным видом посмотрел через открытое окошко кареты на спущенные шторы соседских окон. Одна отдернута: старуха глазеет. Приплюснула нос к стеклу: побелел. Благодарит небо, что не ее черед. Поразительно, какой у них интерес к трупам. Рады нас проводить на тот свет так тяжко родить на этот.Занятие в самый раз по ним. Шушуканье по углам. Шмыгают неслышно в шлепанцах боятся еще проснется. Потом прибрать его. Положить на стол.Молли и миссис Флеминг стелют ложе[]. Подтяните слегка к себе. Наш саван. Не узнаешь кто тебя мертвого будет трогать. Обмыть тело, голову. Ногти и волосы, кажется, подрезают. Часть на память в конвертик. Потом все равно отрастают. Нечистое занятие.Все ждали, не говоря ни слова. Наверно, венки выносят. На что-то твердое сел. А, это мыло в заднем кармане. Лучше убрать оттуда. Подожди случая.Все ждали. Потом спереди донеслись звуки колес  ближе  потом стук копыт. Тряхнуло. Карета тронулась, скрипя и покачиваясь. Послышались другие копыта и скрипучие колеса, сзади. Проплыли соседские окна и номер девятый с открытой дверью, с крепом на дверном молотке. Шагом.Они еще выжидали, с подпрыгивающими коленями, покуда не повернули и не поехали вдоль трамвайной линии. Трайтонвилл-роуд. Быстрей. Колеса застучали по булыжной мостовой, и расшатанные стекла запрыгали, стуча, в рамах. По какой это он дороге?  спросил мистер Пауэр в оба окошка. Айриштаун,  ответил Мартин Каннингем.  Рингсенд. Брансвик-стрит.Мистер Дедал, поглядев наружу, кивнул. Хороший старый обычай[],  сказал он.  Отрадно, что еще не забыт.С минуту все смотрели в окна на фуражки и шляпы, приподнимаемые прохожими. Дань уважения. Карета, миновав Уотери-лейн, свернула с рельсов на более гладкую дорогу. Взгляд мистера Блума заметил стройного юношу в трауре и широкополой шляпе. Тут мимо один ваш друг, Дедал,  сказал он. Кто это? Ваш сын и наследник. Где он там?  спросил мистер Дедал, перегибаясь к окну напротив.Карета, миновав улицу с доходными домами и развороченной, в канавах и ямах, мостовой, свернула, накренившись, за угол и снова покатила вдоль рельсов, громко стуча колесами. Мистер Дедал откинулся назад и спросил: А этот прохвост Маллиган тоже с ним? Его  []? Да нет, он один,  ответил мистер Блум. От тетушки Салли, надо думать,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Эта шайка Гулдингов, пьяненький счетоводишка и Крисси, папочкина вошка-сикушка[], то мудрое дитя, что узнает отца[].Мистер Блум бесстрастно усмехнулся, глядя на Рингсенд-роуд. Братья Уоллес, производство бутылок. Мост Доддер.Ричи Гулдинг с портфелем стряпчего. Гулдинг, Коллис и Уорд, так он всем называет фирму. Его шуточки уже сильно с бородой. А был хоть куда.Воскресным утром танцевал на улице вальс с Игнатием Галлахером[], на Стеймер-стрит, напялив две хозяйкины шляпы на голову. Ночи напролет куролесил. Теперь начинает расплачиваться: боюсь, что эта его боль в пояснице. Жена утюжит спину. Думает вылечиться пилюльками. А в них один хлеб. Процентов шестьсот чистой прибыли. Связался со всяким сбродом,  продолжал сварливо мистер Дедал.  Этот Маллиган, вам любой скажет, это отпетый бандит, насквозь испорченный тип. От одного его имени воняет по всему Дублину. Но с помощью Божией и Пресвятой Девы, я им особо займусь, я напишу его матери, или тетке, или кто она там ему такое письмо, что у нее глаза полезут на лоб. Я тыл ему коленом почешу[], могу вас заверить.Он силился перекричать громыханье колес: Я не позволю, чтобы этот ублюдок, ее племянничек, губил бы моего сына. Отродье зазывалы из лавки. Шнурки продает у моего родича, Питера Пола Максвайни[]. Не выйдет.Он смолк. Мистер Блум перевел взгляд с его сердитых усов на кроткое лицо мистера Пауэра, потом на глаза и бороду Мартина Каннингема, которые солидно покачивались. Шумливый человек, своевольный. Носится со своим сыном. И правильно. Что-то после себя оставить. Если бы Руди, малютка, остался жить. Видеть, как он растет. Слышать голосок в доме. Как идет рядом с Молли в итонской курточке[]. Мой сын. Я в его глазах. Странное было бы ощущение. От меня. Слепой случай. Это видно тем утром на Реймонд-террас она из окна глядела как две собаки случаются под стеной не содейте зла[]. И сержант ухмылялся. Она была в том палевом халате с прорехой, так и не собралась зашить. Польди, давай мы. Ох, я так хочу, умираю. Так начинается жизнь.Потом в положении. Пришлось отменить концерт в Грейстоуне. Мой сын в ней. Я мог бы его поставить на ноги. Мог бы. Сделать самостоятельным. Немецкому научить. Мы не опаздываем?  спросил мистер Пауэр. На десять минут,  сказал Мартин Каннингем, посмотрев на часы.Молли. Милли. То же самое, но пожиже. Ругается как мальчишка. Катись колбаской! Чертики с рожками! Нет, она милая девчушка. Станет уж скоро женщиной. Моллингар. Дражайший папулька. Студент. Да, да: тоже женщина, Жизнь. Жизнь.Карету качнуло взад-вперед и с ней четыре их ту лова. Корни мог бы нам дать какую-нибудь колымагу поудобней,  заметил мистер Пауэр. Мог бы,  сказал мистер Дедал,  если бы он так не косил. Вы меня понимаете?Он прищурил левый глаз. Мартин Каннингем начал смахивать хлебные крошки со своего сиденья. Что это еще, Боже милостивый?  проговорил он.  Крошки? Похоже, что кто-то тут устраивал недавно пикник,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Все привстали, недовольно оглядывая прелую, с оборванными пуговицами, кожу сидений. Мистер Дедал покрутил носом, глядя вниз, поморщился и сказал: Или я сильно ошибаюсь Как вам кажется, Мартин? Я и сам поразился,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Блум опустился на сиденье. Удачно, что зашел в баню. Ноги чувствуешь совершенно чистыми. Вот только бы еще миссис Флеминг заштопала эти носки получше.Мистер Дедал, отрешенно вздохнув, сказал: В конце концов, это самая естественная вещь на свете. А Том Кернан появился?  спросил Мартин Каннингем, слегка теребя кончик бороды. Да,  ответил мистер Блум.  Он едет за нами с Хайнсом[] и с Недом Лэмбертом. А сам Корни Келлехер?  спросил мистер Пауэр. На кладбище,  сказал Мартин Каннингем. Я встретил утром Маккоя,  сообщил мистер Блум,  и он сказал, тоже постарается приехать.Карета резко остановилась. Что там такое? Застряли. Где мы?Мистер Блум высунул голову из окна. Большой канал,  сказал он.Газовый завод. Говорят, вылечивает коклюш. Повезло, что у Милли этого не было. Бедные дети. Сгибаются пополам в конвульсиях, синеют, чернеют.Просто кошмар. С болезнями сравнительно легко обошлось. Одна корь. Чай из льняного семени. Скарлатина, эпидемии инфлюэнцы Рекламные агенты смерти.Не упустите такого случая. Вон там собачий приют. Старый Атос, бедняга!Будь добрым к Атосу, Леопольд, это мое последнее желание. Да будет воля твоя. Слушаемся их, когда они в могиле. Предсмертные каракули. Он себе места не находил, тосковал. Смирный пес. У стариков обычно такие.Капля дождя упала ему на шляпу. Он спрятал голову и увидел, как серые плиты моментально усеялись темными точками. По отдельности. Интересно. Как через сито. Я так и думал, пойдет. Помнится, подошвы скрипели. Погода меняется,  спокойно сообщил он. Жаль, быстро испортилась,  откликнулся Мартин Каннингем. Для полей нужно,  сказал мистер Пауэр.  А вон и солнце опять выходит.Мистер Дедал, воззрившись через очки на задернутое солнце, послал немое проклятие небесам. Не надежнее, чем попка младенца,  изрек он. Поехали.Колеса с усилием завертелись снова, и торсы сидящих мягко качнуло.Мартин Каннингем живее затеребил кончик бороды. Вчера вечером Том Кернан был грандиозен,  сказал он.  А Падди Леонард[] его передразнивал у него на глазах. О, покажите-ка нам его, Мартин,  оживился мистер Пауэр.  Сейчас вы, Саймон, услышите, как он высказался про исполнение Стриженого паренька[] Беном Доллардом. Грандиозно,  с напыщенностью произнес Мартин Каннингем.  То, как он спел эту простую балладу, Мартин, это самое проникновенное исполнение, какое мне доводилось слышать при всем моем долгом опыте . Проникновенное,  со смехом повторил мистер Пауэр.  Это словечко у него просто пунктик. И еще  ретроспективное упорядочение. Читали речь Дэна Доусона[]?  спросил Мартин Каннингем. Я нет,  сказал мистер Дедал.  А где это? В сегодняшней утренней.Мистер Блум вынул газету из внутреннего кармана. Я еще должен поменять книгу для нее. Нет-нет,  сказал поспешно мистер Дедал.  Потом, пожалуйста.Взгляд мистера Блума скользнул по крайнему столбцу, пробежав некрологи.Каллан, Коулмен, Дигнам, Фоусетт, Лаури, Наумен, Пик, это какой Пик, не тот, что служил у Кроссби и Оллейна? нет, Секстон, Эрбрайт. Черные литеры уже начали стираться на потрепанной и мятой бумаге. Благодарение Маленькому Цветку[]. Горькая утрата. К невыразимой скорби его. В возрасте  лет, после продолжительной и тяжелой болезни. Панихида на тридцатый день.Квинлен. Да помилует Иисус Сладчайший душу его.Уж месяц как Генри ушел без возвратаВ обители вечной он пребываетСемейство скорбит над жестокой утратойНа встречу в горнем краю уповая.А я конверт разорвал? Да. А куда положил письмо, после того как перечитывал в бане? Он ощупал свой жилетный карман. Тут. Генри ушел без возврата. Пока у меня еще есть терпение.Школа. Лесосклад Мида. Стоянка кэбов. Всего два сейчас. Дремлют.Раздулись, как клещи. Мозгов почти нет, одни черепные кости. Еще один трусит с седоком. Час назад я тут проходил. Извозчики приподняли шапки.Спина стрелочника неожиданно выросла, распрямившись, возле трамвайного столба, у самого окна мистера Блума. Разве нельзя придумать что-нибудь автоматическое чтобы колеса сами гораздо удобней? Да но тогда этот парень потеряет работу? Да но зато еще кто-то получит работу, делать то, что придумают?Концертный зал Эншент. Закрыт сегодня. Прохожий в горчичном костюме, с крепом на рукаве. Некрупная скорбь. Четверть траура. Женина родня, скажем.Они проехали мрачную кафедру святого Марка, под железнодорожным мостом, мимо театра Куинз: в молчании. Рекламные щиты. Юджин Стрэттон[], миссис Бэндмен Палмер. А не сходить ли мне на Лию сегодня вечером? Говорил ведь что. Или на Лилию Килларни[]? Оперная труппа Элстер Граймс. Новый сенсационный спектакль. Афиши на будущую неделю, еще влажные, яркие.Бристольские забавы[]. Мартин Каннингем мог бы достать контрамарку в Гэйети. Придется ему поставить. Шило на мыло.Он придет днем. Ее песни.Шляпы Плестоу. Бюст сэра Филипа Крэмптона у фонтана. А кто он был-то? Как поживаете?  произнес Мартин Каннингем, приветственно поднося ладонь ко лбу. Он нас не видит,  сказал мистер Пауэр.  Нет, видит. Как поживаете? Кто?  спросил мистер Дедал. Буян Бойлан,  ответил мистер Пауэр.  Вон он, вышел проветриться.В точности когда я подумал.Мистер Дедал перегнулся поприветствовать. От дверей ресторана Ред бэнк блеснул ответно белый диск соломенной шляпы  скрылся.Мистер Блум осмотрел ногти у себя на левой руке, потом на правой руке.Да, ногти. Что в нем такого есть что они она видит? Наваждение. Ведь хуже не сыщешь в Дублине. Этим и жив. Иногда они человека чувствуют. Инстинкт.Но этакого гуся. Мои ногти. А что, просто смотрю на них: вполне ухожены. А после: одна, раздумывает. Тело не такое уже упругое. Я бы заметил по памяти. Отчего так бывает наверно кожа не успевает стянуться когда с тела спадет. Но фигура еще на месте. Еще как на месте. Плечи Бедра. Полные.Вечером, когда одевалась на бал. Рубашка сзади застряла между половинок.Он зажал руки между колен и отсутствующим, довольным взглядом обвел их лица.Мистер Пауэр спросил: Что слышно с вашим турне, Блум? О, все отлично,  отвечал мистер Блум.  Мнения самые одобрительные. Вы понимаете, такая удачная идея А вы сами поедете? Нет, знаете ли,  сказал мистер Блум.  Мне надо съездить в графство Клэр по одному частному делу. Идея в том, чтобы охватить главные города.Если в одном прогоришь, в других можно наверстать. Очень правильно,  одобрил Мартин Каннингем.  Сейчас там Мэри Андерсон[]. А партнеры у вас хорошие? Ее импресарио Луис Вернер,  сказал мистер Блум.  О да, у нас все из самых видных. Дж.К.Дойл и Джон Маккормак[] я надеюсь и. Лучшие, одним словом. И Мадам,  добавил с улыбкой мистер Пауэр.  Хоть упомянем последней, все равно первая.Мистер Блум развел руками в жесте мягкой учтивости и снова сжал руки.Смит ОБрайен. Кто-то положил букет у подножия. Женщина. Наверно, годовщина смерти. Желаем еще многих счастливых. Объезжая статую Фаррелла[], карета бесшумно сдвинула их несопротивляющиеся колени.Ркии: старик в темных лохмотьях протягивал с обочины свой товар, разевая рот: ркии. Шну-ркии, четыре на пенни.Интересно, за что ему запретили практику. Имел свою контору на Хьюм-стрит. В том же доме, где Твиди, однофамилец Молли, королевский адвокат графства Уотерфорд. Цилиндр с тех пор сохранился. Остатки былой роскоши. Тоже в трауре. Но так скатиться, бедняга! Каждый пинает, как собаку. Последние деньки ОКаллахана[].И Мадам. Двадцать минут двенадцатого. Встала. Миссис Флеминг принялась за уборку. Причесывается, напевает:    . Нет:   []. Рассматривает кончики волос, не секутся ли.     []. Очень красиво у нее это : рыдающий звук.Тревожный. Трепетный. В самом слове трепет уже это слышится.Глаза его скользнули по приветливому лицу мистера Пауэра. Виски седеют.Мадам: и улыбается. Я тоже улыбнулся. Улыбка доходит в любую даль. А может, просто из вежливости. Приятный человек. Интересно, это правду рассказывают насчет его содержанки? Для жены ничего приятного. Но кто-то меня уверял, будто бы между ними ничего плотского. Можно себе представить, тогда у них живо бы все завяло. Да, это Крофтон[] его как-то встретил вечером, он нес ей фунт вырезки. Где же она служила? Барменша в Джури.Или из Мойры?Они проехали под фигурой Освободителя[] в обширном плаще.Мартин Каннингем легонько коснулся мистера Пауэра. Из колена Рувимова[],  сказал он.Высокий чернобородый мужчина с палкой грузно проковылял за угол слоновника Элвери[], показав им за спиной скрюченную горстью ладонь. Во всей своей девственной красе,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Мистер Дедал, поглядев вслед ковыляющей фигуре, пожелал кротко: Чтоб тебе сатана пропорол печенки!Мистер Пауэр, зашедшись неудержимым смехом, заслонил лицо от окна, когда карета проезжала статую Грэя. Мы все это испытали,  заметил неопределенно Мартин Каннингем.Глаза его встретились с глазами мистера Блума. Погладив свою бороду, он добавил: Ну, скажем, почти все из нас.Мистер Блум заговорил с внезапною живостью, вглядываясь в лица спутников. Это просто отличная история, что ходит насчет Рувима Дж. и его сына. Про лодочника?  спросил мистер Пауэр. Да-да. Отличная ведь история? А что там?  спросил мистер Дедал.  Я не слышал. Там возникла какая-то девица,  начал мистер Блум,  и он решил услать его от греха подальше на остров Мэн, но когда они оба Что-что?  переспросил мистер Дедал.  Это этот окаянный уродец? Ну да,  сказал мистер Блум.  Они оба уже шли на пароход, и тот вдруг в воду Варавва в воду[]!  воскликнул мистер Дедал.  Экая жалость, не утонул!Мистер Пауэр снова зашелся смехом, выпуская воздух через заслоненные ноздри. Да нет,  принялся объяснять мистер Блум,  это сынМартин Каннингем бесцеремонно вмешался в его речь. Рувим Дж. с сыном шли по набережной реки к пароходу на остров Мэн, и тут вдруг юный балбес вырвался и через парапет прямо в Лиффи. Боже правый!  воскликнул мистер Дедал в испуге.  И утонул? Утонул!  усмехнулся Мартин Каннингем.  Он утонет! Лодочник его выудил багром за штаны и причалил с ним прямиком к папаше, с полумертвым от страху. Полгорода там столпилось. Да,  сказал мистер Блум,  но самое-то смешное И Рувим Дж.,  продолжал Мартин Каннингем,  пожаловал лодочнику флорин за спасение жизни сына.Приглушенный вздох вырвался из-под ладони мистера Пауэра. Да-да, пожаловал,  подчеркнул Мартин Каннингем.  Героически.Серебряный флорин. Отличная ведь история?  повторил с живостью мистер Блум. Переплатил шиллинг и восемь пенсов,  бесстрастно заметил мистер Дедал.Тихий сдавленный смех мистера Пауэра раздался в карете.Колонна Нельсона. Сливы, восемь на пенни! Восемь на пенни! Давайте-ка мы примем более серьезный вид,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Дедал вздохнул: Бедняга Падди не стал бы ворчать на нас, что мы посмеялись. В свое время сам порассказывал хороших историй. Да простит мне Бог!  проговорил мистер Пауэр, вытирая влажные глаза пальцами.  Бедный Падди! Не думал я неделю назад, когда его встретил последний раз и был он, как всегда, здоровехонек, что буду ехать за ним вот так. Ушел от нас. Из всех, кто только носил шляпу на голове, самый достойный крепышок,  выразился мистер Дедал.  Ушел в одночасье. Удар,  молвил Мартин Каннингем.  Сердце.Печально он похлопал себя по груди.Лицо как распаренное: багровое. Злоупотреблял горячительным. Средство от красноты носа. Пей до чертиков, покуда не станет трупно-серым. Порядком он денег потратил, чтоб перекрасить.Мистер Пауэр смотрел на проплывающие дома со скорбным сочувствием. Бедняга, так внезапно скончался. Наилучшая смерть,  сказал мистер Блум.Они поглядели на него широко открытыми глазами. Никаких страданий,  сказал он.  Момент, и кончено. Как умереть во сне.Все промолчали.Мертвая сторона улицы. Днем всякий унылый бизнес, земельные конторы, гостиница для непьющих, железнодорожный справочник Фолконера, училище гражданской службы, Гилл, католический клуб, общество слепых. Почему?Какая то есть причина. Солнце или ветер. И вечером то же. Горняшки да подмастерья. Под покровительством покойного отца Мэтью[]. Камень для памятника Парнеллу. Удар. Сердце.Белые лошади с белыми султанами галопом вынеслись из-за угла Ротонды.Мелькнул маленький гробик. Спешит в могилу. Погребальная карета.Неженатый. Женатому вороных. Старому холостяку пегих. А монашке мышастых. Грустно,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Какой-то ребенок.Личико карлика, лиловое, сморщенное, как было у малютки Руди. Тельце карлика, мягкое, как замазка, в сосновом гробике с белой обивкой внутри.Похороны оплачены товариществом. Пенни в неделю за клочок на кладбище.Наш. Бедный. Крошка. Младенец. Несмышленыш. Ошибка природы. Если здоров, это от матери. Если нет, от отца. В следующий раз больше повезет. Бедный малютка,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Отмаялся.Карета медленно взбиралась на холм Ратленд-сквер. Растрясут его кости[]. Свалят гроб на погосте. Горемыка безродный. Всему свету чужой. В расцвете жизни[],  промолвил Мартин Каннингем. Но самое худшее,  сказал мистер Пауэр,  это когда человек кончает с собой.Мартин Каннингем быстрым движением вынул часы, кашлянул, спрятал часы обратно. И это такое бесчестье, если у кого-то в семье,  продолжал мистер Пауэр. Временное умопомрачение, разумеется,  решительно произнес Мартин Каннингем.  Надо к этому относиться с милосердием. Говорят, тот, кто так поступает, трус,  сказал мистер Дедал. Не нам судить,  возразил Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Блум, собравшись было заговорить, снова сомкнул уста. Большие глаза Мартина Каннингема. Сейчас отвернулся. Гуманный, сострадательный человек. И умный. На Шекспира похож[]. Всегда найдет доброе слово. А у них никакой жалости насчет этого, и насчет детоубийства тоже. Лишают христианского погребения. Раньше загоняли в могилу кол, в сердце ему. Как будто и так уже не разбито. Но иногда те раскаиваются, слишком поздно.Находят на дне реки[] вцепившимися в камыши. Посмотрел на меня. Жена у него жуткая пьянчужка[]. Сколько раз он заново обставит квартиру, а она мебель закладывает чуть ли не каждую субботу. Жизнь как у проклятого. Это надо каменное сердце. Каждый понедельник все заново. Тяни лямку. Матерь Божья, хороша же она была в тот вечер. Дедал рассказывал, он там был. Как есть в стельку, и приплясывает с мартиновым зонтиком:На Востоке слыву я первейшейАх, первейшей Красавицей гейшей[].Опять отвернулся. Знает. Растрясут его кости.В тот день, дознание. На столе пузырек с красным ярлыком. Номер в гостинице, с охотничьими картинками. Духота. Солнце просвечивает сквозь жалюзи. Уши следователя крупные, волосатые. Показания коридорного. Сперва подумал, он спит. Потом увидал на лице вроде как желтые потеки. Свесился с кровати. Заключение: чрезмерная доза. Смерть в результате неосторожности.Письмо. Моему сыну Леопольду.Не будет больше мучений. Никогда не проснешься. Всему свету чужой.Лошади припустили вскачь по Блессингтон-стрит. Свалят гроб на погосте. А мы разогнались, я вижу,  заметил Мартин Каннингем. Авось, он нас не перевернет,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Надеюсь, нет,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  В Германии завтра большие гонки. Кубок Гордона Беннета[]. Да, убей бог,  хмыкнул мистер Дедал.  Это бы стоило посмотреть.Когда они свернули на Беркли-стрит, уличная шарманка возле Бассейна встретила и проводила их разухабистым скачущим мотивчиком мюзик-холла. Не видали Келли[]? Ка  е два эл  и. Марш мертвых из Саула[]. Этот старый негодник Антонио[]. Меня бросил без всяких резонио. Пируэт! Скорбящая Божья Матерь. Экклс-стрит. Там дальше мой дом. Большая больница. Вон там палата для безнадежных. Это обнадеживает. Приют Богоматери для умирающих.Мертвецкая тут же в подвале, удобно. Где умерла старая миссис Риордан[]. Эти женщины, ужасно на них смотреть. Ее кормят из чашки, подбирают ложечкой вокруг рта. Потом обносят кровать ширмой, оставляют умирать. Славный был тот студент, к которому я пришел с пчелиным укусом. Потом сказали, он перешел в родильный приют. Из одной крайности в другую.Карета завернула галопом за угол  и стала. Что там еще?Стадо клейменого скота, разделившись, обтекало карету, тяжело ступая разбитыми копытами, мыча, лениво обмахивая хвостами загаженные костлявые крупы. По бокам и в гуще гурта трусили меченые овцы, блея от страха. Эмигранты,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Гей! Гей!  покрикивал голос скотогона, бич его щелкал по их бокам.  Гей! С дороги!Конечно, четверг. Завтра же день забоя. Молодняк. У Каффа шли в среднем по двадцать семь фунтов. Видимо, в Ливерпуль. Ростбиф для старой Англии[].Скупают самых упитанных. И потом пятая четверть теряется: все это сырье, шерсть, шкуры, рога. За год наберется очень порядочно. Торговля убоиной.Побочные продукты с боен идут кожевникам, на мыло, на маргарин. Интересно, еще действует этот трюк, когда можно было мясо с душком покупать прямо с поезда, в Клонзилле.Карета пробиралась сквозь стадо. Не могу понять, почему муниципалитет не проложит линию трамвая от ворот парка к набережным,  сказал мистер Блум.  Можно было бы весь этот скот доставлять вагонами прямо на пароходы. Чем загораживать движение,  поддержал Мартин Каннингем.  Очень правильно. Так и надо бы сделать. Да,  продолжал мистер Блум,  и еще другое я часто думаю, это чтобы устроили похоронные трамваи, знаете, как в Милане. Провести линию до кладбища и пустить специальные трамваи, катафалк, траурный кортеж, все как положено. Вы понимаете мою идею? Ну, это уж анекдот какой-то,  молвил мистер Дедал.  Вагон спальный и вагон-ресторан. Печальные перспективы для Корни,  добавил мистер Пауэр. Почему же?  возразил мистер Блум, оборачиваясь к мистеру Дедалу.  Разве не будет это приличней, чем трястись вот так парами, нос к носу? Ну ладно, может, тут и есть что-то,  снизошел мистер Дедал. И к тому же,  сказал Мартин Каннингем,  мы бы избавились от сцен вроде той, когда катафалк перевернулся у Данфи и опрокинул гроб на дорогу. Совершенно ужасный случай!  сказало потрясенное лицо мистера Пауэра. И труп вывалился на мостовую. Ужасно! Первым на повороте у Данфи,  одобрительно кивнул мистер Дедал.  На кубок Гордона Беннета. Господи помилуй!  произнес набожно Мартин Каннингем.Трах! На попа! Гроб грохается об мостовую. Крышка долой. Падди Дигнам вылетает и катится в пыли как колода в коричневом костюме, который ему велик. Красное лицо  сейчас серое. Рот разинут. Спрашивает, чего такое творится. Правильно закрывают им. Жуткое зрелище с открытым. И внутренности быстрей разлагаются. Самое лучшее закрыть все отверстия. Ага, и там. Воском. Сфинктер расслабляется. Все заткнуть. Данфи,  объявил мистер Пауэр, когда карета повернула направо.Перекресток Данфи. Стоят траурные кареты: залить горе. Придорожный привал. Для трактира идеальное место. Наверняка заглянем на обратном пути пропустить за его здоровье. Чаша утешения. Эликсир жизни.А допустим правда случилось бы. Пошла бы у него кровь скажем если бы напоролся на гвоздь? И да и нет, я так думаю. Смотря где. Кровообращение останавливается. Но из артерии еще сколько-нибудь может вытечь. Было бы лучше хоронить в красном. В темно-красном.Они ехали молча по Фибсборо-роуд. Навстречу с кладбища пустой катафалк: с облегченным видом.Мост Кроссганс: королевский канал.Вода с ревом устремлялась сквозь шлюзы. Человек стоял на опускающейся барже между штабелями сухого торфа. У створа, на буксирной тропе, лошадь на длинной привязи. Плавание на Бугабу[].Глаза их смотрели на него. По медленным тинистым каналам и рекам проплыл он в своем дощанике через всю Ирландию к побережью на буксирном канате мимо зарослей камыша, над илом, увязшими бутылками, трупами дохлых псов. Атлон, Моллингар, Мойвэлли, я бы мог Милли навестить пешим ходом, шагай себе вдоль канала. Или на велосипеде. Взять старенький напрокат, никакого риска. У Рена был как-то на торгах, только дамский. Улучшать водные пути. У Джеймса Макканна[] хобби катать меня на пароме. Дешевый транспорт. Малыми расстояниями. Плавучие палатки. Туризм. И катафалки можно. Водой на небо. А что, поехать вот так, без предупреждения. Сюрприз.Лейкслип, Клонзилла. Спустился, шлюз за шлюзом, до Дублина. С торфом из внутренних болот. Привет. Он снял соломенную порыжелую шляпу, приветствуя Падди Дигнама.Проехали дом Брайена Бороиме[]. Близко уже. Интересно, как там наш друг Фогарти[],  сказал мистер Пауэр. Спросите у Тома Кернана,  отозвался мистер Дедал. Как так?  спросил Мартин Каннингем.  Я думал, он ему сделал ручкой. Хоть скрылся из глаз, но для памяти дорог[],  промолвил мистер Дедал.Карета повернула налево по Финглас-роуд.Направо камнерезные мастерские. Финишная прямая. На полоске земли столпились безмолвные фигуры, белые, скорбные, простирая безгневно руки, в горе пав на колени, с указующим жестом. Тесаные куски фигур. В белом безмолвии  взывают. Обширный выбор. Том.Х.Деннани, скульптор и изготовитель надгробий.Проехали.Перед домом Джимми Гири, могильщика, сидел на обочине старый бродяга и ворча вытряхивал сор и камешки из здоровенного пропыленного башмака с зияющей пастью. После жизненного странствия.Потянулись угрюмые сады один за другим  угрюмые дома.Мистер Пауэр показал рукой. Вон там был убит Чайлдс[],  сказал он.  В крайнем доме. Там,  подтвердил мистер Дедал.  Жуткая история. Братоубийство. Так считали, по крайней мере. А Сеймур Буш его вытянул. Улик не было,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Одни косвенные,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Таков принцип правосудия. Пусть лучше девяносто девять виновных ускользнут, чем один невиновный будет приговорен[].Они смотрели. Земля убийцы. Зловеще проплыла мимо. Закрыты ставни, никто не живет, запущенный сад[]. Все пошло прахом. Невиновный приговорен.Убийство. Лицо убийцы в зрачках убитого. Про такое любят читать. В саду найдена голова мужчины. Одежда ее состояла из. Как она встретила смертный час. Знаки недавнего насилия. Орудием послужило. Убийца еще на свободе. Улики. Шнурок от ботинок. Тело решено эксгумировать. Убийство всегда откроется.Теснота тут в карете. А вдруг ей не понравится если я нежданно-негаданно. С женщинами надо поосторожней. Один раз застанешь со спущенными панталонами, всю жизнь не простит. Пятнадцать.Прутья высокой ограды Проспекта замелькали рябью в глазах. Темные тополя[], редкие белые очертания. Очертания чаще, белые силуэты толпою среди деревьев, белые очертания, части их, безмолвно скользили мимо с тщетными в воздухе застывшими жестами.Ободья скрипнули по обочине: стоп. Мартин Каннингем потянулся к ручке, нажал, повернул ее и распахнул дверцу, толкнув коленом. Он вышел. За ним мистер Пауэр и мистер Дедал.Момент переложить мыло. Рука мистера Блума проворно расстегнула задний брючный карман и отправила мыло, слипшееся с оберткой, во внутренний карман с носовым платком. Он вышел, сунув обратно газету, которую все еще держала другая рука.Убогие похороны: три кареты и катафалк. Какая разница. Факельщики, золоченая сбруя, заупокойная месса, артиллерийский салют. Смерть с помпой.У последней кареты стоял разносчик с лотком фруктов и пирожков. Черствые пирожки ссохлись вместе: пирожки для покойников. Собачья радость. Кто их ест? Те, кто обратно с кладбища.Он шел за своими спутниками, позади мистер Кернан и Нед Лэмберт, за ними Хайнс. Корни Келлехер, стоявший у открытого катафалка, взял два венка и передал один мальчику.А куда же делись те детские похороны?Упряжка лошадей со стороны Финглас-роуд натужно тащила в похоронном молчании скрипучую телегу с глыбой гранита. Шагавший впереди возчик снял шапку.Теперь гроб. Хоть мертвый, а поспел раньше[]. Лошадь оглядывается на него, султан съехал. Глаза тусклые: хомут давит, зажало ей вену или что там. А знают они что такое возят сюда каждый день? Верно что ни день похорон двадцать  тридцать. Еще Иеронимова Гора для протестантов. Хоронят везде и всюду каждую минуту по всему миру. Спихивают под землю возами, в спешном порядке. Тысячи каждый час. Чересчур много развелось.Из ворот выходили женщина и девочка в трауре. Тонкогубая гарпия, из жестких деловых баб, шляпка набок. У девочки замурзанное лицо в слезах, держит мать за руку, смотрит на нее снизу, надо или не надо плакать. Рыбье лицо, бескровное, синее[].Служители подняли гроб и понесли в ворота. Мертвый вес больше. Я сам себя чувствовал тяжелей, когда вылезал из ванны. Сначала труп: потом друзья трупа. За гробом с венками шли Корни Келлехер и мальчик. А кто это рядом с ними? Ах да, свояк.Все двигались следом.Мартин Каннингем зашептал: Я так и обомлел, когда вы при Блуме начали о самоубийствах. Что-что?  зашептал мистер Пауэр.  А почему? Его отец отравился,  шептал Мартин Каннингем.  Он был хозяин отеля Куинз в Эннисе. Слышали он сказал он едет в Клэр. Годовщина. О Господи!  шептал мистер Пауэр.  В первый раз слышу. Отравился!Он оглянулся туда, где в сторону усыпальницы кардинала двигалось лицо с темными задумчивыми глазами. Беседуя. А он был застрахован?  спросил мистер Блум. Кажется, да,  отвечал мистер Кернан,  но только он заложил свой полис. Мартин хлопочет, чтобы младшего устроить в Артейн[]. А сколько всего детишек? Пятеро. Нед Лэмберт обещает устроить одну из девочек к Тодду[]. Печальный случай,  с сочувствием произнес мистер Блум.  Пятеро маленьких детей. А какой удар для жены,  добавил мистер Кернан. Еще бы,  согласился мистер Блум.Чихала она теперь на него.Он опустил взгляд на свои начищенные ботинки. Она пережила его.Овдовела. Для нее он мертвее, чем для меня. Всегда один должен пережить другого. Мудрецы говорят. Женщин на свете больше, мужчин меньше. Выразить ей соболезнование. Ваша ужасная утрата. Надеюсь, вы вскоре последуете за ним. Это только вдовы индусов. Она может выйти за другого. За него? Нет.Хотя кто знает. Вдовство больше не в чести, как старая королева умерла[].Везли на лафете. Виктория и Альберт. Траурная церемония во Фрогморе[]. Но в конце она себе позволила парочку фиалок на шляпку. Тщеславие, в сердце сердца[]. Все ради тени. Консорт, даже не король. Ее сын, вот где было что-то реальное. Какая-то новая надежда, а не то прошлое, которое, она все ждала, вернется. Оно не может вернуться. Кому-то уйти первым  в одиночку, под землю  и не лежать уж в ее теплой постели. Как поживаете, Саймон?  тихо спросил Нед Лэмберт, пожимая руку.  Не виделись с вами целую вечность. Лучше не бывает. А что новенького в нашем преславном Корке? Я ездил туда на скачки на светлой неделе,  сказал Нед Лэмберт.  Нового одно старое. Остановился у Дика Тайви. И как там наш Дик, честняга? Как есть ничего между ним и небом,  выразился Нед Лэмберт. Силы небесные!  ахнул мистер Дедал в тихом изумлении.  Дик Тайви облысел? Мартин Каннингем пустил подписной лист в пользу ребятни,  сказал Нед Лэмберт, кивнув вперед.  По нескольку шиллингов с души. Чтобы им продержаться, пока получат страховку. Да-да,  произнес неопределенно мистер Дедал.  Это что, старший там впереди? Да,  сказал Нед Лэмберт,  и брат жены. За ними Джон Генри Ментон. Он уже подписался на фунт. Я был всегда в нем уверен,  заявил мистер Дедал.  Сколько раз я говорил Падди, чтоб он держался за ту работу. Джон Генри  это не худшее, что бывает. А как он потерял это место?  спросил Нед Лэмберт.  Попивал чересчур? Грешок многих добрых людей,  со вздохом молвил мистер Дедал.Они остановились у входа в часовню. Мистер Блум стоял позади мальчика с венком, глядя вниз на его прилизанные волосы и тонкую, с ложбинкой, шею в новеньком тесном воротничке. Бедный мальчуган! Был ли он при этом, когда отец? Оба без сознания. В последний миг приходит в себя и узнает всех в последний раз. Все что он мог бы сделать. Я должен три шиллинга ОГрэди.Понимал ли он? Служители внесли гроб в часовню. Где голова у него?Через мгновение он прошел за другими, моргая после яркого света. Гроб стоял перед алтарем на подставке, по углам четыре высокие желтые свечи.Всегда впереди нас. Корни Келлехер, прислонив венки у передних углов, знаком указал мальчику стать на колени. Вошедшие стали там и сям на колени у мест для молящихся. Мистер Блум стоял позади, невдалеке от купели, и, когда все стали на колени, аккуратно уронил из кармана развернутую газету и стал на нее правым коленом. На левое колено он осторожно поместил свою шляпу и, придерживая ее за поля, благочестиво склонил голову.Из дверей появился служка[], неся медное ведерко с чем-то внутри. За ним шел священник в белом, одной рукой поправляя столу, другой придерживая маленькую книжицу у своего жабьего брюха. А кто будет нам читать? Каркнул ворон: я опять[].Они стали у гроба, и священник принялся быстро каркать по своей книжке.Отец Гробби. Я помню, как-то похоже на гроб. []. Здоровенная морда. Заправляет спектаклем. Дюжий христианин[]. Горе тому, кто на него косо глянет: священник. Ты еси Петр.Отъел бока, как баран на клевере, сказал бы Дедал. И брюхо раздулось, как у дохлого пса. Где он такие выражения находит, диву даешься. Пуфф: бока лопаются.       , [].Дает им чувство собственной важности, когда над ними молятся по-латыни.Заупокойная месса. Все в трауре, рыдают. Бумага с траурной каймой. Твое имя в поминальном листе. Как зябко тут. Его и тянет поесть, когда сидит уныло все утро притопывает ногами да ждет следующего милости просим. И глаза жабьи. С чего его так пучит? Молли, эту с капусты. Может быть, тут воздух такой. На вид как будто раздут от газов. В таком месте должна быть адская пропасть газов. Мясников взять: сами становятся как сырые бифштексы. Кто мне рассказывал? Мервин Браун[]. В крипте святой Верберги[] у них чудный орган старинный полтораста лет им там пришлось пробуравить дырки в гробах чтобы газы выпустить и поджечь. Со свистом вырывается: синий. Свистнуло  и тебя нет.Колено больно. Ох. Вот так лучше.Священник взял из служкиного ведерка палку с шишкой на конце и помахал ей над гробом. Потом пошел в ноги гроба, помахал там. Вернулся на место и положил ее обратно в ведерко. Каким и был покуда не упокоился. Это все записано: он это все обязан проделать.      [].Служка вторил ему писклявым дискантом. Я часто думал, что лучше брать прислугу из мальчиков. Лет до пятнадцати. Старше уже, конечноА там святая вода, должно быть. Окропляет сном. Небось уже обрыдло ему махать махалкой над всеми трупами что подвозят. Пускай бы полюбовался над чем он машет. Каждый божий день свежая порция: мужчины средних лет, старухи, дети, женщины, умершие родами, бородачи, лысые бизнесмены, чахоточные девицы с цыплячьими грудками. Круглый год бормочет над ними одно и то же потом покропит водой: спите. Сейчас вот Дигнама.  [].Говорит он пойдет в рай или уже в раю. Над каждым повторяет. Нудное дело. Но что-то он должен говорить.Священник закрыл книжку и вышел, служка за ним. Корни Келлехер открыл боковые двери, и вошли могильщики. Они снова подняли гроб, вынесли его и опустили на свою каталку. Корни Келлехер дал один венок мальчику, другой свояку, и все следом за ними вышли через боковые двери на воздух, теплый и пасмурный. Мистер Блум вышел последним, сунув обратно в карман сложенную газету. Взор его оставался чинно потуплен, пока каталка с гробом не повернула налево. Железные колеса визгливо скрежетнули по гравию, и отряд тупоносых башмаков двинулся за каталкой по аллее могил.Тари тара тари тара тару. Батюшки, тут разве можно петь. Мавзолей ОКоннелла,  сказал Дедал рядом с ним.Кроткие глаза мистера Пауэра поднялись к вершине высокого обелиска. Тут он покоится,  произнес он,  среди своего народа, старый Дэн О.Но сердце его погребено в Риме[]. А сколько разбитых сердец погребено тут, Саймон! Там вон ее могила, Джек,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Скоро и я лягу рядом. Да призовет Он меня, когда будет воля Его.Не удержавшись, он начал тихо всхлипывать, бредя неровной, оступающейся походкой. Мистер Пауэр взял его под руку. Ей лучше там, где она сейчас,  мягко промолвил он. Да, я знаю,  ответил сдавленно мистер Дедал.  Она сейчас на небе, если только есть небо.Корни Келлехер шагнул в сторону и пропустил остальных вперед. Печальные события,  учтиво заговорил мистер Кернан.Мистер Блум прикрыл глаза и дважды скорбно покивал головой. Все остальные надели шляпы,  заметил мистер Кернан.  Я думаю, и нам тоже стоит. Мы последние. Это кладбище коварное место.Они покрыли головы. А вам не кажется, что его преподобие отслужил слишком скоропалительно?  сказал с неодобрением мистер Кернан.Мистер Блум солидно кивнул, глянув в живые глаза с красными прожилками.Скрытные глаза, скрытные и обыскивающие. Видимо, масон: точно не знаю.Опять рядом с ним. Мы последние. В равном положении. Авось, он что-нибудь еще скажет.Мистер Кернан добавил: Служба Ирландской Церкви[], на Иеронимовой Горе и проще и более впечатляет, я должен это сказать.Мистер Блум выразил сдержанное согласие. Язык, конечно, многое значит.Мистер Кернан торжественно произнес: Я есмь воскресение и жизнь . Это проникает до самой глубины сердца. Действительно,  сказал мистер Блум.Твоего то может и да но какой прок малому в ящике шесть футов на два с цветочком из пятки? Ему проникает? Седалище страстей. Разбитое сердце. В конечном счете насос, качает каждый день сотни галлонов крови. Потом в один прекрасный день закупорка, и ты с концами. Их тут вокруг навалом: кишки, печенки, сердца. Старые ржавые насосы -и ни черта больше.Воскресение и жизнь. Уж если умер так умер. Или идея насчет страшного суда. Всех вытряхнуть из могил. Лазарь! иди вон. А пошла вонь, и трюк провалился. Подъем! Страшный суд! И все шныряют как мыши, разыскивают свои печенки и селезенки и прочие потроха. Чтоб все до крохи собрал за утро, так твою и растак. Ползолотника праху в черепе. Двенадцать гран ползолотника. Тройская мера[].Корни Келлехер пристроился к ним. Все было экстра-класс,  сказал он.  А?Он искоса поглядел на них тягучим взглядом. Грудь полисмена. С твоим труляля труляля. Как полагается,  согласился мистер Кернан. Что? А?  переспросил Корни Келлехер.Мистер Кернан повторил. А кто это позади нас с Томом Кернаном?  спросил Джон Генри Ментон.  Лицо знакомое.Нед Лэмберт мельком оглянулся назад. Блум,  ответил он.  Мадам Мэрион Твиди, та, что была, вернее, она и есть, певица, сопрано. Это жена его. А, вон что,  протянул Джон Генри Ментон.  Давненько я ее не видал. Была эффектная женщина. Я танцевал с ней, постой-ка, тому назад пятнадцать  семнадцать золотых годиков, у Мэта Диллона в Раундтауне. Было что подержать в руках.Он оглянулся в конец процессии. А что он такое? Чем занимается? Он не был в писчебумажной торговле?Помню, я с ним расплевался как-то вечером в кегельбане.Нед Лэмберт усмехнулся: Ну как же, был. Пропагандист промокашек. Бога ради,  посетовал Джон Генри Ментон,  и что она вышла за этого гуся лапчатого? Ведь какая была, с изюминкой, с огоньком. Такой пока и осталась,  заверил Нед Лэмберт.  А он сейчас рекламный агент.Большие выпуклые глаза Джона Генри Ментона глядели неподвижно вперед.Тележка свернула в боковую аллею. Солидный мужчина выступил из засады за кустами и снял шляпу. Могильщики тронули свои кепки. Джон ОКоннелл,  сказал мистер Пауэр, довольный.  Никогда не забудет друга.Мистер ОКоннелл молча пожал всем руки. Мистер Дедал сказал: Я снова с визитом к вам. Любезный Саймон,  произнес негромко смотритель,  я совсем не желаю вас в свои завсегдатаи.Поклонившись Неду Лэмберту и Джону Генри Ментону, он пошел рядом с Мартином Каннингемом, позвякивая связкой ключей у себя за спиной. А вы не слышали историю,  спросил он у всех,  насчет Малкэхи из Кума? Я не слыхал,  ответил Мартин Каннингем.Все дружно склонили к нему цилиндры, Хайнс тоже подставил ухо.Смотритель подцепил большими пальцами золотую цепочку от часов и, деликатно понизив голос, заговорил, обращаясь к их выжидательным улыбкам: Рассказывают, будто бы двое дружков, подвыпив, в один туманный вечер заявились сюда навестить могилу приятеля. Спросили, где тут лежит Малкэхи из Кума, им объяснили, куда идти. Ну-с, проплутав сколько-то в тумане, они находят могилу. Один из пьяниц читает по буквам: Теренс Малкэхи. Другой в это время хлопает глазами на статую Спасителя, которую вдова заказала и поставила.Смотритель похлопал глазами на один из попутных памятников. Потом снова продолжал: Ну, поморгал он, поморгал на божественную статую и говорит: Да ни хрена он не похож на нашего Малкэхи. Какой-то сапожник делал, ни малейшего сходства .Вознагражденный улыбками, он пропустил их вперед и принялся тихо толковать с Корни Келлехером, забирая у него квитанции, листая и проглядывая их на ходу. Это он специально,  объяснил Мартин Каннингем Хайнсу. Знаю,  ответил Хайнс,  я раскусил. Подбодрить публику,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Из чистой доброты, ничего другого.Мистера Блума восхищала осанистая фигура смотрителя. С ним все хотят быть в хороших отношениях. Глубоко порядочный человек, Джон ОКоннелл, отличной выпечки. Ключи  как реклама для Ключчи  нет опасения, что кто-то сбежит, на выходе не проверяем. Хабеат корпус[]. После похорон надо заняться этой рекламой. Кажется, я написал Боллсбридж на том конверте, которым прикрыл листок, когда она вдруг вошла, а я писал Марте. Еще застрянет как неверно заадресованное. Не мешало бы побриться. Щетина седая. Это первый признак, когда волос седеет у корней. Еще характер портится. И в седых волосах уж блестит серебро[]. Интересно, что чувствует его жена. Как у него хватило духу сделать кому-то предложение. Пошли, будешь жить на кладбище. Огорошить ее этим. Сначала, может, это ее возбудит. Смерть в ухажерах. Тут всюду ночные тени роятся при таком множестве мертвецов. Тени могил когда скрипят гроба[] и Дэниэл ОКоннелл наверно он потомок его кто ж это уверял будто он был со странностями и любвеобилен на редкость но все равно великий католик как огромный гигант во тьме. Блуждающие огоньки. Могильные газы. Ей надо отвлекать мысли от этого, а то не сможет зачать. Женщины особенно впечатлительны. Рассказать ей в постели историю с привидениями, чтоб заснула. Ты видела когда-нибудь привидение? Знаешь, а я видел. Стояла тьма, хоть глаз выколи. Часы пробили двенадцать. Но могут и целоваться со всем пылом, стоит только настроить. В Турции шлюхи на кладбищах. Если взять молодую, чему угодно научится.Можешь тут подцепить молодую вдовушку. Мужчинам такое нравится. Любовь среди могил[]. Ромео. Обостряет удовольствие. В расцвете смерти объяты мы жизнью. Крайности сходятся. Танталовы муки для бедных мертвецов. Запахи жареных бифштексов для голодных. Гложущих собственные потроха. Желание подразнить других. Молли хотелось заняться любовью перед окном. Как бы там ни было, восемь детей у него.Он тут насмотрелся вдоволь на уходящих в землю, укладывает ими участок за участком вокруг. Святые поля. Больше было бы места, если хоронить стоя.Сидя или же на коленях не выйдет. Стоя[]? В один прекрасный день, оползень или что, вдруг голова показывается наружу, и протянутая рука. Тут вся земля кругом, наверное, как соты: продолговатые ячейки. Содержит все в чистоте: бордюры, трава подрезана. Майор Гэмбл[] называет Иеронимову Гору мой сад. А что, верно. Должны быть сонные цветы. Мастянский говорил, в Китае гигантские маки на кладбищах дают самый лучший опиум. Ботанический сад тут недалеко. Кровь впитывается в землю дает новую жизнь. Та же идея у тех евреев что говорят убили христианского мальчика[]. Каждому человеку своя цена. Хорошо сохранившийся жирный труп джентльмена-эпикурейца необходим для вашего сада. Цена дешевая. Туша Вильяма Уилкинсона, ревизора и бухгалтера, недавно скончавшегося, три фунта тринадцать и шесть. Рады служить вам.Можно ручаться почва тучнеет на славу от трупного удобрения, кости, мясо, ногти. Начинка склепов. Жуть. Делаются зеленые и розовые, разлагаются. В сырой земле гниют быстро. Тощие старики дольше держатся.Становятся не то сальные не то творожистые. Потом чернеют, сочатся черной вонючей патокой. Потом высыхают. Мотыльки смерти[]. Конечно клетки или что там есть живут дальше. Изменяются, но по сути вечные. Нечем кормиться кормятся собой.На них ведь должна развестись чертова погибель червей. Должно быть в почве так и кишат так и кружат. Вскрюжат голову бедняжке. Щечки в ямочках, кудряшки. А вид у него вполне бодрый. Дает ему ощущение власти, видеть как все уходят в землю раньше него. Интересно как он смотрит на жизнь. Не прочь пошутить: отвести душу. Анекдот-сообщение. Сперджен отправился на небо сегодня утром в  часа. Сейчас  вечера, время закрытия. Еще не прибыл. Петр. Мертвецы и сами по крайней мере мужчины вполне бы послушали анекдотец, а женщинам бы разузнать насчет моды. Сочную грушу или дамский пунш, крепкий, сладкий, горячий. Предохраняет от сырости. Смеяться полезно так что это самое лучшее когда в таком стиле. Могильщики в Гамлете: говорит о глубоком знании наших душ. О мертвых нельзя шутить по крайней мере два года.     []. Сначала чтобы кончился траур. Трудно представить себе его похороны. Как будто каламбур. Говорят прочесть собственный некролог будешь жить дольше. Дает второе дыхание. Новый контракт на жизнь. Сколько у нас на завтра?  спросил смотритель. Двое,  ответил Корни Келлехер.  В пол-одиннадцатого и в одиннадцать.Смотритель сунул бумаги в карман. Колеса каталки остановились.Присутствующие, разделившись, пройдя осторожно между могил, стали по обе стороны ямы. Могильщики сняли гроб и поставили его носом на край, подведя снизу веревки.Хороним его. Днесь Цезаря пришли мы хоронить[]. Его мартовские или июньские иды[]. Он не знает кто тут и ему все равно.Нет, а это-то еще кто этот долговязый раззява в макинтоше? Нет правда кто хочу знать. Нет грош я дам за то чтоб узнать. Всегда кто-нибудь объявится о ком ты отродясь не слыхивал. Человек может всю жизнь прожить в одиночестве. А что, может. Но все-таки кто-то ему нужен кто бы его зарыл хотя могилу он себе может выкопать сам. Это мы все делаем. Только человек погребает. Нет, еще муравьи. Первое что всех поражает. Хоронить мертвых.Говорят Робинзон Крузо был на самом деле. Тогда стало быть Пятница его и похоронил. Каждая Пятница хоронит четверг если так поглядеть.О бедный Крузо Робинзон,И как же смог прожить там он[]?Бедный Дигнам! Последнее земное ложе его в этом ящике. Как подумаешь сколько их кажется такой тратой дерева. Все равно сгложут. А можно было бы придумать нарядный гроб с какой-то скажем панелью чтобы с нее соскальзывали. Эх только будут возражать чтобы их хоронили в из-под другого. Страшная привередливость. Положите меня в родной земле[]. Горсточку глины из Палестины. Только мать и мертворожденного могут похоронить в одном гробу[]. А я понимаю почему. Понимаю. Чтобы его защищать как можно дольше даже в земле. Дом ирландца его гроб[]. Бальзамирование в катакомбах, мумии, тот же смысл.Мистер Блум стоял поодаль со шляпой в руках, считая обнаженные головы.Двенадцать, я тринадцатый. Нет. Чудик в макинтоше тринадцатый. Число смерти. И откуда он выскочил? В часовне не было, за это я поручусь.Глупейший предрассудок насчет тринадцати.Хороший твид, мягкий, у Неда Лэмберта на костюме. Красноватая искра. У меня был похожий когда жили на Западной Ломбард-стрит. Раньше он был большой щеголь. Три раза на день менял костюм. А мой серый надо снести к Мизайесу, чтоб перелицевал. Эге. Да он перекрашен. Надо бы его жене хотя у него нет жены или там хозяйке повыдергивать эти нитки.Гроб уходил из вида, могильщики спускали его, крепко уперев ноги на подгробных подпорах. Они выпрямились и отошли: и все обнажили головы.Двадцать.Пауза.Если бы все мы вдруг стали кем-то еще.Вдалеке проревел осел. К дождю. Не такой уж осел. Говорят, никогда не увидишь мертвого осла[]. Стыд смерти. Прячутся. Бедный папа тоже уехал[].Легкий ветерок овевал обнаженные головы, шепча. Шепот. Мальчик возле могилы держал обеими руками венок, покорно глядя в открытый черный провал.Мистер Блум стал позади осанистого и благожелательного смотрителя. Фрак хорошо пошит. Прикидывает наверно кто из нас следующий. Что ж, это долгий отдых. Ничего не чувствуешь. Только сам момент чувствуешь. Должно быть чертовски неприятно. Сперва не можешь поверить. Должно быть ошибка: это не меня. Спросите в доме напротив. Обождите, я хотел то. Я не успел это.Потом затемненная палата для смертников. Им хочется света[]. Кругом перешептываются. Вы не хотите позвать священника? Потом бессвязная речь, мысли путаются. Бред: все что ты скрывал всю жизнь. Борьба со смертью. Это у него не естественный сон. Оттяните нижнее веко. Смотрят: а нос заострился а челюсть отвисла а подошвы ног пожелтели? Заберите подушку и пусть кончается на полу все равно обречен[]. На той картинке смерть грешника ему дьявол показывает женщину. И он умирающий в рубашке тянется ее обнять.Последний акт Лючии. Ужель никогда не увижу тебя?[] Бамм! Испустил дух.Отошел наконец-то. Люди слегка поговорят о тебе  и забудут. Не забывайте молиться о нем. Поминайте его в своих молитвах. Даже Парнелл. День плюща отмирает[]. Потом и сами за ним: один за другим все в яму.Мы сейчас молимся за упокой его души. Три к носу брат и не угоди в ад.Приятная перемена климата. Со сковородки жизни в огонь чистилища.А думает он когда-нибудь про яму ждущую его самого? Говорят про это думаешь если внезапно дрожь проберет в жаркий день. Кто-то прошел по твоей могиле. Предупреждение: скоро на выход. За другими. Моя в том конце к Фингласу, участок что я купил. Мама бедная мамочка и малютка Руди.Могильщики взялись за лопаты и начали швырять на гроб тяжелые комья глины. Мистер Блум отвернул лицо. А если он все это время был жив? Брр!Вот это уж было бы ужасно! Нет, нет: он мертвый, конечно. Конечно мертвый.В понедельник умер. Надо бы какой-то закон чтобы протыкать им сердце для верности или электрический звонок в гробу или телефон и какую-нибудь решетку для доступа воздуха. Сигнал бедствия. Три дня. Летом это довольно долго. Пожалуй лучше сразу сплавлять как только уверились что не.Глина падала мягче. Начинают забывать. С глаз долой из сердца вон.Смотритель отошел в сторону и надел шляпу. С него хватит. Провожающие понемногу приободрились и неприметно, один за другим, тоже покрывали головы. Мистер Блум надел шляпу и увидел, как осанистая фигура споро прокладывает путь в лабиринте могил. Спокойно, с хозяйской уверенностью, пересекал он поля скорби[]: Хайнс что-то строчит в блокнотике. А, имена. Он же их все знает. Нет: идет ко мне. Я тут записываю имена и фамилии,  полушепотом сказал Хайнс.  Ваше как имя? Я не совсем помню. На эл,  отвечал мистер Блум.  Леопольд. И можете еще записать Маккоя. Он меня попросил. Чарли[],  произнес Хайнс, записывая.  Знаю его. Он когда-то работал во Фримене.Верно, работал, до того как устроился в морге под началом Луиса Берна.Хорошая мысль чтобы доктора делали посмертные вскрытия. Выяснить то что им кажется они и так знают. Он скончался от Вторника. Намазал пятки. Смылся, прихватив выручку с нескольких объявлений. Чарли, ты моя душка. Потому он меня и попросил. Ладно, кому от этого вред. Я все сделал, Маккой. Спасибо, старина, премного обязан. Вот и пускай будет обязан  а мне ничего не стоит. И скажите-ка,  продолжал Хайнс,  вы не знаете этого типа, ну там вон стоял, еще на немОн поискал глазами вокруг. Макинтош,  сказал мистер Блум.  Да, я его видел. Куда же он делся? Макинтош,  повторил Хайнс, записывая.  Не знаю, кто он такой. Это его фамилия?Он двинулся дальше, оглядываясь по сторонам. Да нет,  начал мистер Блум, оборачиваясь задержать его.  Нет же, Хайнс!Не слышит. А? Куда же тот испарился? Ни следа. Ну что же из всех кто.Не видали? Ка е два эл. Стал невидимкой. Господи, что с ним сталось?Седьмой могильщик подошел к мистеру Блуму взять лежавшую рядом с ним лопату. О, извините!Он поспешно посторонился.Бурая сырая глина уже видна была в яме. Она поднималась. Вровень. Гора сырых комьев росла все выше, росла, и могильщики опустили свои лопаты. На минуту все опять обнажили головы. Мальчик прислонил венок сбоку, свояк положил свой сверху. Могильщики надели кепки и понесли обглиненные лопаты к тележке. Постукали лезвием по земле: очистили. Один нагнулся и снял с черенка длинный пучок травы. Еще один отделился от товарищей и медленно побрел прочь, взяв на плечо оружие с синеблещущим лезвием. Другой в головах могилы медленно сматывал веревки, на которых спускали гроб. Его пуповина. Свояк, отвернувшись, что-то вложил в его свободную руку.Безмолвная благодарность. Сочувствуем, сэр: такое горе. Кивок. Понимаю.Вот лично вам.Участники похорон разбредались медленно, бесцельно, окольными тропками задерживались у могил прочесть имена. Давайте кругом, мимо могилы вождя[],  предложил Хайнс.  Время есть. Давайте,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Они свернули направо, следуя медленному течению своих мыслей. Тусклый голос мистера Пауэра с суеверным почтением произнес: Говорят, его вовсе и нет в могиле. Гроб был набит камнями. И что он еще вернется когда-нибудь.Хайнс покачал головой. Парнелл никогда не вернется,  сказал он.  Он там, все то, что было смертного в нем. Мир праху его.Мистер Блум шагал в одиночестве под деревьями меж опечаленных ангелов, крестов, обломанных колонн, фамильных склепов, каменных надежд, молящихся с поднятыми горе взорами, мимо старой Ирландии рук и сердец[]. Разумнее тратить эти деньги на добрые дела для живых. Молитесь за упокой души его.Как будто кто-то на самом деле. Спустили в яму и кончено. Как уголь по желобу. Потом для экономии времени за всех чохом. День поминовения.Двадцать седьмого я буду у него на могиле. Садовнику десять шиллингов.Выпалывает сорняки. Сам старик. Сгорбленный в три погибели, щелкает своими ножницами. В могиле одной ногой, Ушедший от нас. Покинувший этот мир. Как будто они по своей воле. Всех выкинули пинком. Сыгравший в ящик.Интересней, если б писали, кто они были. Имярек, колесник. Я был коммивояжер, сбывал коркский линолеум. Я выплачивал по пять шиллингов за фунт. Или женщина с кастрюлей. Я стряпала добрую ирландскую похлебку. Как там это стихотворение эклогия на сельском кладбище[] написал то ли Вордсворт то ли Томас Кемпбелл. У протестантов говорят: обрел вечный покой. Или старый доктор Моррен: великая исцелительница позвала его к себе. Для них это Божий надел[]. Очень милая загородная резиденция. Заново оштукатурена и покрашена. Идеальное местечко, чтобы спокойно покурить и почитать Черч таймс[].Объявления о свадьбах никогда не берут в веночек. Проржавелые венки, гирлянды из фольги висели на крестах и оградках. Вот это выгодней. Хотя цветы более поэтично. А такое надоедает, не вянет никогда. Совершенно невыразительно. Бессмертники.Птица неподвижно сидела на ветке тополя. Как чучело. Как наш свадебный подарок от олдермена Хупера. Кыш! Не пошевельнется. Знает, что тут не ходят с рогатками. Это еще печальней, мертвые животные. Милли-глупышка хоронила мертвую птичку в коробочке, на могилку венок из маргариток, обрывки бусиков.Это Святое Сердце там: выставлено напоказ[]. Душа нараспашку. Должно быть сбоку и раскрашено красным как настоящее сердце. Ирландия была ему посвящена или в этом роде. Выглядит страшно недовольным. За что мне такое наказание? Птицы слетались бы и клевали как там про мальчика с корзинкой плодов но он сказал нет потому что они бы испугались мальчика[]. Аполлон это был.Сколько их[]! И все когда-то разгуливали по Дублину. В бозе почившие. И мы были прежде такими, как ты теперь.И потом как можно всех запомнить? Глаза, голос, походку. Ладно, голос  положим: граммофон. Установить в каждом гробу граммофон или иметь дома.После воскресного обеда. Поставим-ка нашего бедного прадедушку. Кррааххек!Здраздрраздраст страшнорад крххек страшнорадсновавстре здраздрас стррашкррпуффс. Напоминает голос как фотография напоминает лицо. Иначе ты бы не вспомнил лицо скажем через пятнадцать лет. Чье например? Например кого-то кто умер когда я был у Уиздома Хили.Фыррст! Шорох камней. Стой. Обожди-ка.Он остановился вглядываясь в подножие склепа. Какой-то зверь. Погоди.Вон вылезает.Жирная серая крыса проковыляла вдоль стены склепа, шурша по гравию.Старый ветеран  прапрадедушка  знает все ходы-выходы. Серая живность протиснулась в щель под стену, сжавшись и извиваясь. Вот где прятать сокровища.Кто там живет? Здесь покоится Роберт Эмери[]. Роберта Эммета похоронили тут при свете факелов, так, кажется? Совершает обход.Хвост скрылся.Такие вот молодцы живо разделаются с любым. Не будут разбирать кто оставят гладкие косточки. Для них мясо и мясо. Труп это протухшее мясо. А сыр тогда что такое? Труп молока. В этих Путешествиях по Китаю[] написано что китайцы говорят от белых воняет трупом. Лучше сжигать. Попы страшно против. На руку другой фирме. Оптовая торговля кремационными и голландскими печами. Чумные поветрия. Сваливают в ямы с негашеной известкой. Камеры усыпления для животных. Прах еси и в прах возвратишься.Или хоронить в море. Где это про башню молчания у парсов[]? Птицы пожирают.Земля, огонь, вода. Говорят утонуть приятней всего. В одной вспышке видишь всю свою жизнь. А если спасли уже нет. Но в воздухе нельзя хоронить. С аэроплана. Интересно, передаются там новости когда свеженького спускают под землю. Подземные средства связи. Мы этому научились у них. Не удивился бы. Их хлеб насущный. Мухи слетаются когда еще не помер как следует.Пронюхали про Дигнама. Запах это им все равно. Рыхлая белая как соль трупная каша: на запах, на вкус как сырая репа.Ворота забелелись впереди: открыты еще. Обратно на этот свет. Довольно тут. Каждый раз приближаешься еще на шаг. Последний раз был на похоронах миссис Синико[]. И у бедного папы. Любовь которая убивает. Бывает даже разрывают землю ночью при фонарях как тот случай я читал чтоб добраться до свежезахороненной женщины или уже даже тронутой когда трупные язвы пошли.Мурашки забегают от такого. Я тебе явлюсь после смерти. Ты увидишь призрак мой после смерти. Мой призрак будет тебя преследовать после смерти.Существует тот свет после смерти и называется он ад. Мне совсем не нравится тот свет, так она написала. Мне нисколько не больше. Еще столько есть посмотреть, услышать, почувствовать. Чувствовать тепло живых существ рядом. Пускай эти спят в своих червивых постелях. В этом тайме они меня еще не возьмут. Теплые постели: теплая полнокровная жизнь.Мартин Каннингем появился из боковой аллеи, о чем-то серьезно говоря.Кажется, стряпчий. Лицо знакомое. Ментон, Джон Генри, стряпчий, поверенный по присягам и свидетельствам. Дигнам работал у него раньше. У Мэта Диллона в давние времена. Мэт компанейский человек. Веселые вечеринки. Холодная дичь, сигареты, танталовы кружки. Уж вот у кого золотое сердце. Да, Ментон. В тот вечер в кегельбане взъярился на меня как черт что я заехал своим шаром к нему. Просто по чистейшей случайности: смазал. А он меня всеми фибрами невзлюбил. Ненависть с первого взгляда.Молли и Флуи Диллон обнялись под сиренью, хихикали. Мужчины всегда так, их до смерти уязвляет если при женщинах.На шляпе у него вмятина на боку. Из кареты наверно. Прошу прощения, сэр,  сказал мистер Блум, поравнявшись с ними.Они остановились. У вас шляпа слегка помялась,  показал мистер Блум.Джон Генри Ментон одно мгновение смотрел на него в упор, не двигаясь. Тут вот,  пришел на выручку Мартин Каннингем и показал тоже.Джон Генри Ментон снял шляпу, исправил вмятину и тщательно пригладил ворс о рукав. Затем опять нахлобучил шляпу. Теперь все в порядке,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Джон Генри Ментон отрывисто дернул головой в знак признательности. Спасибо,  бросил он кратко.Они продолжали свой путь к воротам. Мистер Блум, удрученный, отстал на несколько шагов, чтобы не подслушивать разговора. Мартин разделает этого законника. Мартин такого обалдуя обведет и выведет, пока тот не успеет рта разинуть.Рачьи глаза. Ничего. Потом еще может пожалеет когда дойдет до него. И получится твой верх.Спасибо. Ишь ты, какие мы важные с утра.Эпизод []В СЕРДЦЕ ИРЛАНДСКОЙ СТОЛИЦЫПеред колонною Нельсона[] трамваи притормаживали, меняли пути, переводили дугу, отправлялись на Блэкрок, Кингстаун и Долки, Клонски, Рэтгар и Тереньюр, Пальмерстон парк и Верхний Рэтмайнс, Сэндимаунт Грин, Рэтмайнс, Рингсенд и Сэндимаунт Тауэр, Хэролдс-кросс. Осипший диспетчер Объединенной Дублинской трамвайной компании раскрикивал их: Рэтгар и Тереньюр! Заснул, Сэндимаунт Грин!Параллельно справа и слева со звоном с лязгом одноэтажный и двухэтажный двинулись из конечных тупиков, свернули на выездную колею, заскользили параллельно. Поехал, Пальмерстон парк!ВЕНЦЕНОСЕЦУ дверей главного почтамта чистильщики зазывали и надраивали. Его Величества ярко-красные почтовые кареты, стоящие на Северной Принс-стрит, украшенные по бокам королевскими вензелями ..[], принимали с шумом швыряемые мешки с письмами, открытками, закрытками, бандеролями простыми и заказными, для рассылки в адреса местные, провинциальные, британские и заморских территорий.ПРЕДСТАВИТЕЛИ ПРЕССЫЛомовики в грубых тяжелых сапогах выкатывали с глухим стуком бочки из складов на Принс-стрит и загружали их в фургон пивоварни. В фургон пивоварни загружались бочки, с глухим стуком выкатываемые ломовиками в грубых тяжелых сапогах из складов на Принс-стрит. Вот оно,  сказал Рыжий Мерри.  Алессандро Ключчи. Вы это вырежьте, хорошо?  сказал мистер Блум,  а я захвачу в редакцию Телеграфа.Дверь кабинета Ратледжа снова скрипнула. Дэви Стивенс, малютка в огромном плаще, в маленькой мягкой шляпе, венчающей кудрявую шевелюру, проследовал со свертком бумаг под плащом, королевский гонец.Длинные ножницы Рыжего четырьмя ровными взмахами вырезали объявление из газеты. Ножницы и клей. Я сейчас зайду в типографию,  сказал мистер Блум, принимая квадратик вырезки. Разумеется, если он хочет заметку,  сказал Рыжий Мерри серьезно, с пером за ухом,  мы можем это устроить. Идет,  кивнул мистер Блум.  Я это ему втолкую.Мы.ВИЛЬЯМ БРАЙДЕН[], ЭСКВАЙР, ОКЛЕНД, СЭНДИМАУНТРыжий Мерри тронул рукав мистера Блума своими ножницами и шепнул: Брайден.Мистер Блум обернулся и увидал, как швейцар в ливрее приподнял литерную фуражку при появлении величественной фигуры, что, войдя, двинулась между щитами газет Уикли фримен энд нэшнл пресс и Фрименс джорнэл энд нэшнл пресс. Глухое громыхание пивных бочек. Она прошествовала величественно по лестнице, зонтом себе указуя путь, с лицом недвижноважным, брадообрамленным. Спина в тонких сукнах возносилась с каждой ступенью выше: спина. У него все мозги в затылке, уверяет Саймон Дедал. Плоть складками обвисала сзади. Жирные складки шеи, жир, шея, жир, шея. Вам не кажется, что у него лицо напоминает Спасителя?  шепнул Рыжий-Мерри.И дверь кабинета Ратледжа шепнула: скрип-скрип. Вечно поставят двери напротив одна другой чтобы ветру. Дуй сюда. Дуй отсюда.Спаситель: брадообрамленный овал лица; беседа в вечерних сумерках.Мария, Марфа. За путеводным зонтом-мечом к рампе: Марио, тенор[]. Или Марио,  сказал мистер Блум. Да,  согласился Рыжий Мерри.  Но всегда говорили, что Марио  вылитый Спаситель.Иисус Марио с нарумяненными щеками, в камзоле и тонконогий. Прижал руку к сердцу. В Марте[].Ве е-рнись моя утрата, Ве-е-рнись моя любовь.ПОСОХ И ПЕРО Его преосвященство звонили дважды за это утро,  сказал Рыжий Мерри почтительно.Они смотрели как исчезают из глаз колени, ноги, башмаки. Шея.Влетел мальчишка, разносчик телеграмм, кинул пакет на стойку, вылетел с телеграфной скоростью, бросив лишь слово: "Фримен"!Мистер Блум неторопливо проговорил: Что же, ведь он действительно один из наших спасителей.Кроткая улыбка сопутствовала ему, когда он поднимал крышку стойки и когда выходил в боковые двери и шел темной и теплой лестницей и потом по проходу по доскам, уже совсем расшатавшимся. Спасет ли он однако тираж газеты? Стук. Стук машин.Он толкнул створки застекленных дверей и вошел, переступив через ворох упаковочной бумаги. Пройдя меж лязгающих машин, он проследовал за перегородку, где стоял письменный стол Наннетти[].С ГЛУБОКИМ ПРИСКОРБИЕМ СООБЩАЕМ О КОНЧИНЕ ВЫСОКОЧТИМОГО ГРАЖДАНИНА ДУБЛИНАХайнс тоже тут: сообщение о похоронах наверно. Стук. Перестук.Сегодня утром прах опочившего мистера Патрика Дигнама. Машины.Перемелют человека на атомы если попадется туда. Правят миром сегодня. И его машинерия тоже трудится. Как эти, вышла из подчинения: забродило.Пошло вразнос, рвется вон. А та серая крыса старая рвется чтоб пролезть внутрь.КАК ВЫПУСКАЕТСЯ КРУПНЕЙШАЯ ЕЖЕДНЕВНАЯ ГАЗЕТАМистер Блум остановился за спиной щупловатого фактора, дивясь гладкоблестящей макушке.Странно, он никогда не видал своей настоящей родины. Моя родина Ирландия. Избран от Колледж Грин. Выпячивал как мог что он работяга на полном рабочем дне. Еженедельник берут из-за реклам, объявлений, развлекательных пустячков, а не протухших новостей из официоза. Королева Анна скончалась[]. Опубликовано властями в тыща таком-то году. Поместье расположено в округе Розеналлис, баронские владения Тинначинч. Для всех заинтересованных лиц согласно установлениям приводим сведения о числе мулов и лошадей испанской породы, запроданных на экспорт в Баллине.Заметки о природе. Карикатуры. Очередная история Фила Блейка из серии про быка и Пэта. Страничка для малышей, сказки дядюшки Тоби. Вопросы деревенского простака. Господин Уважаемый Редактор, какое лучшее средство, когда пучит живот? В этом отделе я бы хотел, пожалуй. Уча других, кой-чему сам научишься. Светская хроника. К.О.К[]. Кругом одни картинки. Стройные купальщицы на золотом пляже. Самый большой воздушный шар в мире. Двойной праздник: общая свадьба у двух сестер. Два жениха глядят друг на дружку и хохочут. Купрани, печатник, он ведь тоже. Ирландец больше чем сами ирландцы.Машины лязгали на счет три-четыре. Стук-стук-стук. А положим, вдруг у него удар и никто их не умеет остановить, тогда так и будут без конца лязгать и лязгать, печатать и печатать, туда-сюда, взад-вперед. Мартышкин труд. Тут надо хладнокровие. Давайте пустим это в вечерний выпуск, советник,  сказал Хайнс.Скоро начнет его называть лорд-мэр. Говорят, Длинный Джон[] покровительствует ему.Фактор молча нацарапал печатать в углу листа и сделал знак наборщику.Все так же без единого слова он передал листок за грязную стеклянную перегородку. Прекрасно, благодарю,  сказал Хайнс и повернулся идти.Мистер Блум преграждал ему путь. Если хотите получить деньги, то имейте в виду, кассир как раз уходит обедать,  сказал он, указывая себе за спину большим пальцем. А вы уже?  спросил Хайнс. Гм,  промычал мистер Блум.  Если вы поспешите, еще поймаете его. Спасибо, дружище,  сказал Хайнс.  Пойду и я его потрясу.И он энергично устремился к редакции Фрименс джорнэл.Три шиллинга я ему одолжил у Маэра. Три недели прошло. И третий раз намекаю.МЫ ВИДИМ РЕКЛАМНОГО АГЕНТА ЗА РАБОТОЙМистер Блум положил свою вырезку на стол мистера Наннетти. Прошу прощения, советник,  сказал он.  Вот эта реклама, вы помните, для Ключчи.Мистер Наннетти поглядел на вырезку и кивнул. Он хочет, чтобы поместили в июле,  продолжал мистер Блум.Не слышит. Наннан. Железные нервы.Фактор наставил свой карандаш. Минутку,  сказал мистер Блум,  он бы кое-что хотел изменить.Понимаете, Ключчи. И он хочет два ключа наверху.Адский грохот. Может он понимает что я.Фактор повернулся, готовый выслушать терпеливо, и, подняв локоть, не спеша принялся почесывать под мышкой своего альпакового пиждака. Вот так,  показал мистер Блум, скрестив указательные пальцы наверху.Пускай до него сначала дойдет.Мистер Блум, поглядев вверх и наискось от устроенного им креста, увидел землистое лицо фактора, похоже у него легкая желтуха, а за ним послушные барабаны, пожирающие нескончаемые ленты бумаги. Лязг. Лязг. Мили и мили ненамотанной. А что с ней будет потом? Ну, мало ли: мясо заворачивать, делать кульки: тысячу применений найдут.Проворно вставляя слова в паузы между лязганьем, он быстро начал чертить на исцарапанном столе.ДОМ КЛЮЧ(Ч)ЕЙ[] Вот так, видите. Тут два скрещенных ключа. И круг. А потом имя и фамилия, Алессандро Ключчи, торговля чаем и алкогольными напитками. Ну, и прочее.В его деле лучше его не учить. Вы сами представляете, советник, что ему требуется. И потом наверху по кругу вразрядку: дом ключей. Понимаете? Как ваше мнение, это удачная мысль?Фактор опустил руку ниже и теперь молча почесывал у нижних ребер. Суть идеи,  пояснил мистер Блум,  это дом ключей. Вы же знаете, советник, парламент острова Мэн. Легкий намек на гомруль. Туристы, знаете ли, с острова Мэн. Сразу бросается в глаза. Можете вы так сделать?Пожалуй можно бы у него спросить как произносится это . Ну а вдруг не знает тогда выходит поставлю в неудобное положение. Не будем. Это мы можем,  сказал фактор.  У вас есть эскиз? Я принесу,  заверил мистер Блум.  Это уже печатала газета в Килкенни. У него и там торговля. Сейчас сбегаю и попрошу у него. Стало быть, вы сделайте это и еще коротенькую заметку, чтобы привлечь внимание.Знаете, как обычно. Торговый патент, высокое качество. Давно ощущается необходимость. Ну, и прочее.Фактор подумал минуту. Это мы можем,  повторил он.  Только пускай он закажет на три месяца.Наборщик поднес ему влажный лист верстки, и он молча принялся править.Мистер Блум стоял возле, слушая, как скрипуче вращаются валы, и глядя на наборщиков, склонившихся в молчанье над кассами.НА ТЕМУ ПРАВОПИСАНИЯДолжен все назубок знать как пишется. Охота за опечатками. Мартин Каннингем утром забыл нам дать свой головоломный диктант на правописание.Забавно наблюдать бес а не без прецеде перед дэ эн не ставим нтное изумление уличного разносчика через эсче внезапно оценившего башмаком изысканную тут два эн симме а тут двойное эм, верно? трию сочного грушевого плода заблаговременно в середине о а не а оставленного неизвестным после эс надо тэ доброжелателем у врат некрополя. Нелепо накручено, правда же?Надо мне было сказать что-то когда он напяливал свой цилиндр. Спасибо.Сказать насчет старой шляпы или что-то этакое. Нет. Можно было сказать.Смотрится почти как новая. Поглядеть бы на его физию в этот момент.У ух. Нижний талер ближайшей машины выдвинул вперед доску с первой -у-ух  пачкой сфальцованной бумаги. У-ух. Почти как живая ухает чтоб обратили внимание. Изо всех сил старается заговорить. И та дверь тоже  у-ух  поскрипывает, просит, чтобы прикрыли. Все сущее говорит, только на свой манер. У-ух.ИЗВЕСТНЫЙ ЦЕРКОВНОСЛУЖИТЕЛЬ В РОЛИ КОРРЕСПОНДЕНТАНеожиданно фактор протянул оттиск назад, со словами: Погоди. А где же письмо архиепископа? Его надо перепечатать в Телеграфе. Где этот, как его?Он обвел взглядом свои шумные, но не дающие ответа машины. Монкс, сэр?  спросил голос из словолитни. Ну да. Где Монкс? Монкс!Мистер Блум взял свою вырезку. Пора уходить. Так я принесу эскиз, мистер Наннетти,  сказал он,  и я уверен, вы дадите это на видном месте. Монкс! Да, сэр.Заказ на три месяца. Это надо сперва обдумать на свежую голову. Но попробовать можно. Распишу про август: прекрасная мысль: месяц конной выставки. Боллсбридж[]. Туристы съедутся на выставку.СТАРОСТА ДНЕВНОЙ СМЕНЫОн прошел через наборный цех мимо согбенного старца в фартуке и в очках. Старина Монкс, староста дневной смены. Какой только дребедени не прошло у него через руки за долгую службу: некрологи, трактирные рекламы, речи, бракоразводные тяжбы, обнаружен утопленник. Подходит уж к концу своих сроков. Человек непьющий, серьезный, и с недурным счетом в банке, я полагаю. Жена отменно готовит и стирает. Дочка швея, работает в ателье.Простая девушка, безо всяких фокусов.И БЫЛ ПРАЗДНИК ПАСХИОн приостановился поглядеть, как ловко наборщик верстает текст. Сначала читает его справа налево. Да как быстро, мангиД киртаП. Бедный папа читает мне бывало свою Хаггаду[] справа налево, водит пальцем по строчкам, Пессах.Через год в Иерусалиме. О Боже, Боже! Вся эта длинная история об исходе из земли Египетской и в дом рабства аллилуйя. Шема Исраэл Адонаи Элоим. Нет, это другая. Потом о двенадцати братьях, сыновьях Иакова. И потом ягненок и кошка и собака и палка и вода и мясник. А потом ангел смерти убивает мясника а тот убивает быка а собака убивает кошку. Кажется чепухой пока не вдумаешься как следует. По смыслу здесь правосудие а на поверку о том как каждый пожирает всех кого может. В конечном счете, такова и есть жизнь. Но до чего же он быстро. Отработано до совершенства. Пальцы как будто зрячие.Мистер Блум выбрался из лязга и грохота, пройдя галереей к площадке. И что, тащиться в эту даль на трамвае, а его, может, и не застанешь? Лучше сначала позвонить. Какой у него номер? Да. Как номер дома Цитрона.Двадцатьвосемь. Двадцатьвосемь и две четверки.ОПЯТЬ ЭТО МЫЛООн спустился по лестнице. Кой дьявол тут исчиркал все стены спичками?Как будто на спор старались. И всегда в этих заведениях спертый тяжелый дух. Когда у Тома работал  от неостывшего клея в соседней комнате.Он вынул платок, чтобы прикрыть нос. Цитрон-лимон? Ах, да, у меня же там мыло. Оттуда может и потеряться. Засунув платок обратно, он вынул мыло и упрятал в брючный карман. Карман застегнул на пуговицу.Какими духами душится твоя жена? Еще можно сейчас поехать домой  трамваем  мол забыл что-то. Повидать и все  до этого  за одеванием.Нет. Спокойствие. Нет.Из редакции Ивнинг телеграф вдруг донесся визгливый хохот. Ясно кто это. Что там у них? Зайду на минутку позвонить. Нед Лэмберт, вот это кто.Он тихонько вошел.ЭРИН, ЗЕЛЕНЫЙ САМОЦВЕТ В СЕРЕБРЯНОЙ ОПРАВЕ МОРЯ[] Входит призрак,  тихонько прошамкал запыленному окну профессор Макхью полным печенья ртом.Мистер Дедал, переводя взгляд от пустого камина на ухмыляющуюся физиономию Неда Лэмберта, скептически ее вопросил: Страсти Христовы, неужели у вас от этого не началась бы изжога в заднице?А Нед Лэмберт, усевшись на столе, продолжал читать вслух: Или обратим взор на извивы говорливого ручейка, что, журча и пенясь, враждует с каменистыми препонами на своем пути к бурливым водам голубых владений Нептуна и струится меж мшистых берегов, овеваемый нежными зефирами, покрытый то играющими бляшками света солнца, то мягкою тенью, отбрасываемой на его задумчивое лоно высоким пологом роскошной листвы лесных великанов . Ну, каково, Саймон?  спросил он поверх газеты.  Как вам высокий стиль? Смешивает напитки,  выразился мистер Дедал.Нед Лэмберт хлопнул себя газетою по коленке и, заливаясь хохотом, повторил: Играющие бляхи и задумчивое лоно. Ну, братцы! Ну, братцы! И Ксенофонт смотрел на Марафон,  произнес мистер Дедал, вновь бросив взгляд на нишу камина и оттуда к окну,  и Марафон смотрел на море[]. Хватит уже,  закричал от окна профессор Макхью.  Не желаю больше выслушивать этот вздор.Прикончив ломтик-полумесяц постного печенья, которое непрерывно грыз, он тут же, оголодалый, собрался перейти к следующему, уже заготовленному в другой руке.Высокопарный вздор. Трепачи. Как видим, Нед Лэмберт взял выходной.Все таки похороны, это как-то выбивает из колеи на весь день. Говорят, он пользуется влиянием. Старый Чаттертон[], вице-канцлер, ему двоюродный то ли дедушка, то ли прадедушка. Говорят, уж под девяносто. Небось и некролог на первую полосу давно заготовлен. А он живет им назло. Еще как бы самому не пришлось первым. Джонни, ну-ка уступи место дядюшке. Достопочтенному Хеджесу Эйру Чаттертону. Я так думаю по первым числам он ему выписывает иногда чек а то и парочку дрожащей рукой. То-то будет подарок когда он протянет ноги. Аллилуйя. Очередные потуги,  сказал Нед Лэмберт. А что это такое?  спросил мистер Блум. Вновь найденный недавно фрагмент Цицерона,  произнес профессор Макхью торжественным голосом.  Наша любимая отчизна .КОРОТКО, НО МЕТКО Чья отчизна?  спросил бесхитростно мистер Блум. Весьма уместный вопрос,  сказал профессор, не прекращая жевать.  С ударением на чья. Отчизна Дэна Доусона,  промолвил мистер Дедал. Это его речь вчера вечером?  спросил мистер Блум.Нед Лэмберт кивнул. Да вы послушайте,  сказал он.Дверная ручка пихнула мистера Блума в поясницу: дверь отворяли. Прошу прощения,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, входя.Мистер Блум поспешно посторонился. А я у вас,  сказал он. Привет, Джек. Заходите, заходите. Приветствую. Как поживаете, Дедал? Жить можно. А вы?Дж.Дж.ОМоллой пожал плечами.ПРИСКОРБНОРаньше был самый способный из молодых адвокатов. Скатился, бедняга.Этот чахоточный румянец вернейший признак что песенка спета. Теперь только прощальный поцелуй. Интересно, с чем он пожаловал. Трудности с деньгами. Или задумаем достигнуть горных вершин, сомкнувшихся мощным строем . Вид у вас просто люкс. А редактора можно сейчас увидеть?  спросил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, кивая в сторону другой двери. Сколько угодно,  сказал профессор Макхью.  Не только увидеть, но и услышать. Он с Ленеханом[] в своем святилище.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой не спеша подошел к конторке с подшивкой газеты и начал перелистывать розовые страницы.Практика захирела. Неудачник. Падает духом. Азартные игры. Долги под честное слово. Пожинает бурю. А раньше имел солидные гонорары от Д. и Т.Фицджеральдов. В париках, чтоб показать серое вещество. Мозги выставлены наружу как сердце у той статуи в Гласневине. Кажется, он пописывает какие-то вещицы для Экспресса вместе с Габриэлом Конроем[]. Неплохо начитан. Майлс Кроуфорд начинал в Индепенденте. Просто смешно как эти газетчики готовы вилять, едва почуют что ветер в другую сторону. Флюгера.И нашим и вашим, не поймешь чему верить. Любая басня хороша, пока не расскажут следующую. На чем свет грызутся друг с другом в своих газетах, и вдруг все лопается как мыльный пузырь. И на другое утро уже друзья-приятели. Нет, вы послушайте, послушайте,  взмолился Нед Лэмберт.  Или задумаем достигнуть горных вершин, сомкнувшихся мощным строем  Пустозвонит!  вмешался профессор с раздражением.  Довольно нам этого надутого болтуна! Строем ,  продолжал Нед Лэмберт,  уходящих все выше в небо, дабы словно омыть наши души  Лучше омыл бы глотку,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Господи, Твоя воля!Ну? И за этакое еще платят? Души бесподобною панорамой истинных сокровищ Ирландии, непревзойденных, несмотря на множество хваленых подобий в иных шумно превозносимых краях, по красоте своих тенистых рощ, оживляемых холмами долин и сочных пастбищ, полных весеннею зеленью, погруженной в задумчивое мерцание наших мягких таинственных ирландских сумерек ЕГО РОДНОЕ НАРЕЧИЕ Луна,  сказал профессор Макхью.  Он забыл Гамлета[]. Застилающих вид вдаль и вширь, покуда мерцающий диск луны не воссияет, расточая повсюду свое лучезарное серебро  Ох!  воскликнул мистер Дедал, испустив безнадежный стон.  Ну и дерьмо собачье! С нас уже хватит, Нед. Жизнь и так коротка.Он снял цилиндр и, раздувая в нетерпении густые усы, причесался по валлийскому способу: растопыренной пятерней.Нед Лэмберт отложил газету, довольно посмеиваясь. Через мгновение резкий лающий смех сотряс небритое и в темных очках лицо профессора Макхью. Сдобный Доу!  воскликнул он.КАК ГОВАРИВАЛ ВЕЗЕРАП[]Язвить можно конечно но публика-то это хватает как горячие пирожки.Кстати он кажется сам из булочников? А то с чего его зовут Сдобный Доу. Но кто бы ни был гнездышко он себе устроил недурно. У дочки жених в налоговом управлении, имеет автомобиль. Ловко подцепила его. Приемы, открытый дом.Угощение до отвала. Везерап всегда это говорил. Проводи захват через брюхо.Дверь, ведущая в кабинет, распахнулась резким толчком, и в комнату вдвинулась красноклювая физиономия, увенчанная хохлом торчащих как перья волос. Дерзкие голубые глаза оглядели присутствующих, и резкий голос спросил: Что тут происходит? И вот он, собственною персоной, самозваный помещик[],  торжественно объявил профессор Макхью. Анепошелбыты, жалкий преподавателишка!  выразил редактор свою признательность. Пойдемте, Нед,  сказал мистер Дедал, надевая шляпу.  После такого мне надо выпить. Выпить!  вскричал редактор.  Перед мессой спиртного не подают. Что верно, то верно,  отвечал мистер Дедал, уже выходя.  Пойдемте, Нед.Нед Лэмберт боком соскользнул со стола. Голубые глаза редактора, блуждая, остановились на лице мистера Блума, осененном улыбкой. А вы не присоединитесь, Майлс?  спросил Нед Лэмберт.ВОСПОМИНАНИЯ О ДОСТОПАМЯТНЫХ БИТВАХ Ополчение Северного Корка[]!  вскричал редактор, устремляясь к камину. Мы всегда побеждали! Северный Корк и испанские офицеры! А где это было, Майлс?  спросил Нед Лэмберт, задумчиво разглядывая носки своих башмаков. В Огайо!  крикнул редактор. Там все и было, готов божиться,  согласился Нед Лэмберт.По пути к выходу он шепнул ОМоллою: Начало белой горячки. Печальный случай. Огайо!  кричал редактор петушиным дискантом задрав багровое лицо вверх.  Мой край Огайо! Образцовый кретик[]!  заметил профессор.  Долгий, краткий и долгий.О, ЭОЛОВА АРФАОн достал из жилетного кармана катушку нитки для зубов и, оторвав кусок, ловко натянул его как струну между двумя парами своих нечищеных звучных зубов. Бинг-бэнг. Бэнг-бэнг.Мистер Блум, увидав берег чистым, направился к двери кабинета. Я на минуту, мистер Кроуфорд,  сказал он.  Мне только позвонить насчет одного объявления.Он вошел. А как с передовицей для вечернего выпуска?  спросил профессор Макхью, подойдя к редактору и веско положив руку ему на плечо. Все будет в порядке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд уже несколько спокойней. Можешь не волноваться. Привет, Джек. Тут все в порядке. Здравствуйте, Майлс,  произнес Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, выпуская из рук страницы, мягко скользнувшие к остальной подшивке.  Скажите, это дело о канадском мошенничестве  сегодня[]?В кабинете зажужжал телефон. Двадцать восемь Нет, двадцать Сорок четыре Да.УГАДАЙТЕ ПОБЕДИТЕЛЯЛенехан появился из внутренних помещений с листками бюллетеней Спорта о скачках. Кто хочет верняка на Золотой Кубок?  спросил он.  Корона, жокей ОМэдден.Он бросил листки на стол.Крики и топот босоногих мальчишек-газетчиков, доносившиеся из вестибюля, внезапно приблизились, и дверь распахнулась настежь. Тсс,  произнес Ленехан.  Слышится чья-то пустопь.Профессор Макхью пересек комнату и ухватил съежившегося мальчишку за шиворот, а остальные врассыпную бросились наутек из вестибюля и вниз по лестнице. Сквозняк с мягким шелестом подхватил листки, и они, описав голубые закорючки в воздухе, приземлились под столом. Я не виноват, сэр. Это тот длинный меня впихнул, сэр. Да вышвырни его и закрой ту дверь,  сказал редактор.  А то целый ураган поднялся.Ленехан, нагибаясь и покряхтывая, начал подбирать листки с пола. Мы ждали специального о скачках, сэр,  сказал мальчишка.  Это Пэт Фаррел меня впихнул, сэр.Он указал на две рожицы, заглядывающие в дверную щель. Вон тот, сэр. Ладно, проваливай,  сердито скомандовал профессор Макхью.Он вытолкал мальчишку и крепко захлопнул дверь.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой шелестел подшивкой, что-то отыскивая и бормоча: Продолжение на шестой странице, четвертый столбец. Да, это из редакции Ивнинг телеграф,  говорил мистер Блум по телефону из кабинета.  А хозяин? Да, Телеграф Куда? Ага! На каком аукционе? Ага! Ясно. Хорошо. Я найду его.ПРОИСХОДИТ СТОЛКНОВЕНИЕКогда он положил трубку, телефон снова зажужжал. Он быстро вошел и натолкнулся прямо на Ленехана, боровшегося со вторым листочком. Пардон, месье,  сказал Ленехан, на миг ухватившись за него и скорчив гримасу. Это я виноват,  отвечал мистер Блум, покорно перенося цепкий зажим. Я не ушиб вас? Я очень спешу. Колено,  пожаловался Ленехан.Он сделал смешную мину и захныкал, потирая колено: Ох, набирается годиков нашей эры. Прошу прощения,  сказал мистер Блум.Он подошел к двери и, взявшись уже за ручку, немного помедлил.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой захлопнул тяжелую подшивку. В пустом вестибюле эхом отдавались звуки губной гармошки и двух пронзительных голосов мальчишек, усевшихся на ступеньках:Мы вексфордские парниВ сраженье храбрецы[].БЛУМ УХОДИТ Я должен бежать на Бэйчлорз-уок,  объяснил мистер Блум,  насчет этой рекламы для Ключчи. Надо договориться окончательно. Мне сказали, что он там рядом, у Диллона.Какой то миг он смотрел на них в нерешительности. Редактор, который облокотился на каминную полку, подперев голову рукой, внезапно широким жестом простер руку вперед. Гряди!  возгласил он.  Перед тобою весь мир[].Дж.Дж.ОМоллой взял листки у Ленехана из рук и начал читать, осторожными дуновениями отделяя их друг от друга, не говоря ни слова. Он устроит эту рекламу,  сказал профессор, глядя через очки в черной оправе поверх занавески.  Полюбуйтесь, как эти юные бездельники за ним увязались. Где? Покажите!  закричал Ленехан, подбегая к окну.УЛИЧНОЕ ШЕСТВИЕОба посмеялись, глядя поверх занавески на мальчишек, которые выплясывали гуськом за мистером Блумом, а у последнего белыми зигзагами мотался под ветром шутовской змей с белыми бантиками по хвосту. Поглядеть на свистопляску этих разбойников,  объявил Ленехан,  и тут же загнешься. Ох, пуп с потехи вспотел! Подхватили, как тот вышагивает своими плоскостопыми лапищами. Мелкие бесенята. Подметки на ходу режут.Вдруг с резвостью он принялся карикатурить мазурку, через всю комнату, мимо камина скольженьями устремляясь к ОМоллою, который опустил листки в готовно протянутые его руки. Что это здесь?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд, словно очнувшись.  А где остальные двое? Кто?  обернулся профессор.  Они отправились в Овал малость выпить.Там Падди Хупер, а с ним Джек Холл[]. Приехали вчера вечером. Пошли, раз так,  решил Майлс Кроуфорд.  Где моя шляпа?Дергающейся походкой он прошел в кабинет, отводя полы пиджака и звеня ключами в заднем кармане. Потом ключи звякнули на весу, потом об дерево, когда он запирал свой стол. А он явно уже хорош,  сказал вполголоса профессор Макхью. Кажется, да,  раздумчиво пробормотал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, вынимая свой портсигар.  Но знаете, то, что кажется, не всегда верно. Кто самый богатый спичками?ТРУБКА МИРАОн предложил сигареты профессору, взял сам одну. Ленехан чиркнул проворно спичкой и дал им по очереди прикурить. Дж.Дж.ОМоллой снова раскрыл портсигар и протянул ему. Мерсибо,  сказал Ленехан, беря сигарету.Редактор вышел из кабинета в соломенной шляпе, криво надвинутой на лоб.Продекламировал нараспев, тыча сурово пальцем в профессора Макхью:Да, мощь и слава завлекли тебя,Империя твое пленила сердце[].Профессор усмехнулся, не разомкнув своих длинных губ. Ну, что? Эх, ты, несчастная Римская Империя!  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара. Ленехан тут же гибким движением поднес ему прикурить и сказал: Прошу помолчать. Моя новейшая загадка!  ,  произнес негромко Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Это звучит куда благородней чем британская или брикстонская[]. Слова чем-то напоминают про масло, подливаемое в огонь.Майлс Кроуфорд мощно выпустил в потолок первую струю дыма. Это точно,  сказал он.  Мы и есть масло. Вы и я  масло в огонь. И шансов у нас еще меньше чем у снежного кома в адском пекле.ВЕЛИЧИЕ, ЧЬЕ ИМЯ  РИМ[] Одну минуту,  сказал профессор Макхью, подняв два спокойных когтя.  Не следует поддаваться словам, звучанию слов. Мы думаем о Риме имперском, императорском, императивном[].Он сделал паузу и ораторски простер руки, вылезающие из обтрепанных и грязных манжет: Но какова была их цивилизация? Бескрайна, согласен: но и бездушна. : сточные канавы. Евреи в пустыне или на вершине горы говорили: Отрадно быть здесь. Поставим жертвенник Иегове[]. А римлянин, как и англичанин, следующий по его стопам, приносил с собою на любой новый берег, куда ступала его нога (на наш берег она никогда не ступала[]), одну лишь одержимость клоакой[]. Стоя в своей тоге, он озирался кругом и говорил: Отрадно быть здесь. Соорудим же ватерклозет . Каковой неукоснительно и сооружали,  сказал Ленехан.  Наши древние далекие предки, как можно прочесть в первой главе книги Пития, имели пристрастие к проточной воде. Они были достойными детьми природы,  тихо сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Но у нас есть и римское право. И Понтий Пилат пророк его,  откликнулся профессор Макхью. А вы слышали историю про первого лорда казначейства Поллса?  спросил ОМоллой.  Был парадный обед в королевском университете. Все шло как по маслу Сначала отгадайте загадку,  прервал Ленехан.  Как, готовы?Из вестибюля появился мистер ОМэдден Берк[], высокий, в просторном сером донегальского твида. За ним следовал Стивен Дедал, снимая на ходу шляпу. ,  []!  закричал Ленехан. Я сопровождаю просителя,  произнес благозвучно мистер ОМэдден Берк. Юность, ведомая Опытом, наносит визит Молве. Как поживаете?  сказал редактор, протянув руку.  Заходите. Родитель ваш отбыл только что.Ленехан объявил всем: Внимание! Какая опера страдает хромотой? Думайте, напрягайтесь, соображайте и отвечайте.Стивен протянул отпечатанные на машинке листки, указывая на заголовок и подпись. Кто?  спросил редактор.Край то оторван. Мистер Гэррет Дизи,  ответил Стивен. Старый бродяга,  сказал редактор.  А оторвал кто? Приспичило ему, что ли.Приплыв сквозь бури Сквозь пены клубы Вампир бледнолицый Мне губы впил в губы. Здравствуйте, Стивен,  сказал профессор, подойдя к ним и заглядывая через плечо.  Ящур? Вы что, стали?Быколюбивым бардом.СКАНДАЛ В ФЕШЕНЕБЕЛЬНОМ РЕСТОРАНЕ Здравствуйте, сэр,  отвечал Стивен, краснея.  Это не мое письмо.Мистер Гэррет Дизи меня попросил Знаю, знаю его,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд,  да и жену знавал тоже.Мерзейшая старая карга, какую свет видывал. Вот у нее уж точно был ящур, клянусь Христом! Вспомнить тот вечер, когда она суп выплеснула прямо в лицо официанту в Звезде и Подвязке. Ого-го!Женщина принесла грех в мир. Из-за Елены, сбежавшей от Менелая, греки десять лет. ОРурк, принц Брефни. Он что, вдовец?  спросил Стивен. Ага, соломенный,  отвечал Майлс Кроуфорд, пробегая глазами машинопись.  Императорские конюшни. Габсбург. Ирландец спас ему жизнь на крепостном валу в Вене[]. Не забывайте об этом! Максимилиан Карл ОДоннелл, граф фон Тирконнелл в Ирландии. Сейчас он отправил своего наследника и тот привез королю титул австрийского фельдмаршала. Когда-нибудь будет там заваруха! Дикие гуси. О да, всякий раз. Не забывайте об этом! Забыл ли об этом он, вот вопрос?  тихо произнес ОМоллой, вертя в руках пресс-папье в форме подковы.  Спасать государей  неблагодарное занятие.Профессор Макхью обернулся к нему. А если нет?  спросил он. Я расскажу вам, как было дело,  начал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Как-то раз один венгр[]ОБРЕЧЕННЫЕ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯ. УПОМИНАНИЕ О БЛАГОРОДНОМ МАРКИЗЕ Мы всегда оставались верны обреченным предприятиям,  сказал профессор.  Успех означает для нас гибель разума и воображения. Мы никогда не хранили верность преуспевающим. Мы им прислуживаем. Я преподаю назойливую латынь. Я говорю на языке расы, у которой вершина мышления это афоризм: время  деньги. Материальное господство. ! Господин! А где же духовное? Господь Иисус? Господин Солсбери[]? Диван в клубе в Уэст-Энде.Но греки!КЮРИЕ ЭЛЕЙСОН[]!Светлая улыбка оживила его темнооправленные глаза, еще больше растянула длинные губы. Греки!  повторил он.  Кюриос ! Сияющее слово! Гласные, которых не знают семиты и саксы[]. Кюрие ! Лучезарность разума. Мне бы следовало преподавать греческий, язык интеллекта. Кюрие элейсон ! Строителям клозетов и клоак никогда не быть господами нашего духа. Мы наследники католического рыцарства Европы[], которое пошло ко дну при Трафальгаре, и царства духа  а это вам не ,  которое потонуло вместе с флотом афинян при Эгоспотамах[]. Да-да. Они потонули. Пирр, обманутый оракулом, совершил последнюю попытку повернуть судьбы Греции[]. Верный обреченному предприятию.Он отошел к окну. Они выходили на бой,  продекламировал мистер ОМэдден Берк тусклым голосом,  и гибли они неизменно[]. У-у! Ох-хо-хо!  негромко взрыдал Ленехан.  Получил кирпичом в самом конце представления. Бедняга, о бедняга, бедняга Пирр!Потом он стал нашептывать в ухо Стивену:ЛИМЕРИК ЛЕНЕХАНАВот ученый профессор из Дублина.Протирает очки он насупленно. Но успел он напиться, И в глазах все двоится, Так что труд его  даром погубленный.В трауре по Саллюстию[], как выражается Маллиган. У которого мамаша подохла.Майлс Кроуфорд сунул листки в карман. Ладно, пойдет,  сказал он.  Остальное потом прочту. Все будет в порядке.Ленехан протестующе замахал руками. А как же моя загадка?  сказал он.  Какая опера страдает хромотой? Опера?  сфинксоподобное лицо мистера ОМэддена Берка еще более озагадочилось.Ленехан объявил торжествующе: "Роза Кастилии". Уловили соль? Рожа, костыль. Гы!Шутливо ткнул он мистера ОМэддена Берка под селезенку. Мистер ОМэдден Берк откинулся манерно назад, на свой зонтик, и сделал вид, будто задыхается. Помогите!  выдохнул он.  Мне дурно.На носки привстав, Ленехан немедля принялся обмахивать лицо его шелестящими листочками.Профессор, возвращаясь на место мимо подшивок, тронул легонько рукою распущенные галстуки Стивена и мистера ОМэддена Берка. Париж в прошлом и настоящем. Вы выглядите как коммунары. Как те парни, что взорвали Бастилию,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой с мягкой иронией.  Или, может, это как раз вы с ним пристрелили генерал-губернатора Финляндии? Судя по виду, вы бы вполне могли. Генерала Бобрикова[].ОМНИУМ ПОНЕМНОГУМ Мы еще только собирались,  отвечал Стивен. Соцветие всех талантов,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Юриспруденция, древние языки Скачки,  вставил Ленехан. Литература, журналистика. А будь еще Блум,  сказал профессор,  тогда и тонкое искусство рекламы. И мадам Блум,  добавил мистер ОМэдден Берк.  Муза пения. Любимица всего Дублина.Ленехан громко кашлянул[]. Гм-гм!  произнес он, сильно понизив голос.  Глоток свежего воздуха!Я простудился в парке. Ворота были отворены.ВЫ ЭТО МОЖЕТЕ!Редактор положил Стивену на плечо нервную руку. Я хочу, чтобы вы написали что-нибудь для меня,  сказал он.  Что-нибудь задиристое. Вы это можете. Я по лицу вижу[]. В словаре молодости[]По лицу вижу. По глазам вижу. Маленький ленивый выдумщик. Ящур!  воскликнул редактор с презрительным вызовом.  Великое сборище националистов в Боррис-ин-Оссори[]. Сплошная дичь! Надо таранить публику! Дайте-ка им что-нибудь задиристое. Вставьте туда нас всех, черт его побери. Отца, Сына и Святого Духа и Дристуна Маккарти[]. Мы все можем доставить пищу для ума,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.Стивен, подняв глаза, встретил дерзкий и блуждающий взгляд. Он вас хочет в шайку газетчиков,  пояснил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.ВЕЛИКИЙ ГАЛЛАХЕР Вы это можете,  повторил Майлс Кроуфорд, подкрепляя слова энергичным жестом.  Вот погодите. Мы парализуем Европу, как выражался Игнатий Галлахер, когда он мытарствовал, подрабатывал маркером на бильярде в отеле Кларенс. Галлахер, вот это был журналист. Вот это перо. Знаете, как он сделал карьеру? Я вам расскажу. Виртуознейший образец журнализма за все времена. Дело было в восемьдесят первом[], шестого мая, в пору непобедимых, убийства в парке Феникс, я думаю, вас тогда еще и на свете не было. Сейчас покажу.Он двинулся мимо них к подшивкам. Вот, глядите,  сказал он, оборачиваясь,  Нью-Йорк уорлд запросил специально по телеграфу. Припоминаете?Профессор Макхью кивнул. "Нью-Йорк уорлд",  говорил редактор, приходя в возбуждение и двигая шляпу на затылок.  Где все происходило. Тим Келли, или, верней, Кавана, Джо Брэди и остальные. Где Козья Шкура правил лошадьми. Весь их маршрут, понятно? Козья Шкура,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.  Фицхаррис. Говорят, теперь он Приют извозчика держит у Баттского моста. Это мне Холохан сказал. Знаете Холохана? Прыг-скок, этот, что ли?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд. И Гамли, бедняга, тоже там, так он мне сказал, стережет булыжники для города. Ночной сторож.Стивен с удивлением обернулся. Гамли?  переспросил он.  Да что вы? Тот, что друг моего отца? Да бросьте вы Гамли,  прикрикнул сердито Майлс Кроуфорд.  Пускай стережет булыжники, чтобы не убежали. Взгляните сюда. Что сделал Игнатий Галлахер? Сейчас вам скажу. Гениальное вдохновение. Телеграфировал немедленно. Тут есть Уикли фримен за семнадцатое марта? Прекрасно. Видите это?Он перелистал подшивку и ткнул пальцем. Вот, скажем, четвертая страница, реклама кофе фирмы Брэнсом. Видите? Прекрасно.Зажужжал телефон.ГОЛОС ИЗДАЛЕКА Я подойду,  сказал профессор, направляясь в кабинет. Б  это ворота парка. Отлично.Его трясущийся палец тыкал нетвердо в одну точку за другой. Т  резиденция вице-короля. К  место, где произошло убийство. Н  Нокмарунские ворота.Дряблые складки у него на шее колыхались как сережки у петуха. Плохо накрахмаленная манишка вдруг выскочила, и он резким движением сунул ее обратно в жилет. Алло? Редакция Ивнинг телеграф Алло? Кто говорит? ДаДа Да От Ф до П  это путь, которым ехал Козья Шкура для алиби. Инчикор, Раундтаун, Уинди Арбор, Пальмерстон парк, Ранела. Ф.А.Б.П. Понятно? Х  трактир Дэви на Верхней Лисон-стрит.Профессор показался в дверях кабинета. Это Блум звонит,  сказал он. Пошлите его ко всем чертям,  без промедления отвечал редактор.  Х  это трактир Берка. Ясно?ЛОВКО, И ДАЖЕ ОЧЕНЬ Ловко,  сказал Ленехан.  И даже очень. Преподнес им все на тарелочке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Всю эту дьявольскую историю.Кошмар, от которого ты никогда не проснешься. Я видел сам,  с гордостью произнес редактор.  Я сам был при этом.Дик Адаме[], золотое сердце, добрейший из всех мерзавцев, кого только Господь сподобил родиться в Корке,  и я.Ленехан отвесил поклон воображаемой фигуре и объявил: Мадам, а там Адам. А роза упала на лапу Азора. Всю историю!  восклицал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Старушка с Принс-стрит оказалась первой[]. И был там плач и скрежет зубов. Все из-за одного рекламного объявления. Грегор Грэй сделал эскиз для него и сразу на этом пошел в гору. А потом Падди Хупер обработал Тэй Пэя[], и тот взял его к себе в Стар. Сейчас он у Блюменфельда[]. Вот это пресса. Вот это талант.Пайетт[]! Вот кто им всем был папочкой! Отец сенсационной журналистики,  подтвердил Ленехан,  и зять Криса Каллинана[]. Алло? Вы слушаете? Да, он еще здесь. Вы сами зайдите. Где вы сейчас найдете такого репортера, а?  восклицал редактор.Он захлопнул подшивку. Лесьма вовко,  сказал Ленехан мистеру ОМэддену Берку. Весьма ловко,  согласился мистер ОМэдден Берк.Из кабинета появился профессор Макхью. Кстати, о непобедимых, вы обратили внимание, что нескольких лотошников забрали к главному судье Да-да,  с живостью подхватил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Леди Дадли[] шла домой через парк, хотела поглядеть, как там прошлогодний циклон повалил деревья, и решила купить открытку с видом Дублина. А открытка-то эта оказалась выпущенной в честь то ли Джо Брэди, то ли Главного[] или Козьей Шкуры. И продавали у самой резиденции вице-короля, можете себе представить! Теперешние годятся только в департамент мелкого вздора,  продолжал свое Майлс Кроуфорд.  Тьфу! Что пресса, что суд! Где вы теперь найдете такого юриста, как те прежние, как Уайтсайд[], как Айзек Батт, как среброустый ОХейган? А? Эх, чушь собачья! Тьфу! Гроша ломаного не стоят!Он смолк, но нервная и презрительная гримаса еще продолжала змеиться на губах у него.Захотела бы какая-нибудь поцеловать эти губы? Как знать! А зачем тогда ты это писал.СКЛАД И ЛАДГубы, клубы. Губы  это каким-то образом клубы, так, что ли? Или же клубы  это губы? Что-то такое должно быть. Клубы, тубы, любы, зубы, грубы. Рифмы: два человека, одеты одинаково, выглядят одинаково, по двое, парами[].          , ,  [].Он видел, как они по трое приближаются, девушки в зеленом[], в розовом, в темно-красном, сплетаясь,   [], в лиловом, в пурпурном,   [] в золоте орифламмы,     []. Но я старик, кающийся, в ногах свинец, подчернотою ночи: губы клубы: могила пленила[]. Говорите лишь за себя,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.ДОВЛЕЕТ ДНЕВИ[]Дж.Дж.ОМоллой со слабою улыбкою принял вызов. Дорогой Майлс,  проговорил он, отбрасывая свою сигарету,  вы сделали неверные выводы из моих слов. В настоящий момент на меня не возложена защита третьей профессии[]  профессии, но все же резвость ваших коркских ног слишком заносит вас[]. Отчего нам не вспомнить Генри Граттана[] и Флуда или Демосфена или Эдмунда Берка? Мы все знаем Игнатия Галлахера и его шефа из Чейплизода, Хармсуорта[], издававшего желтые газетенки, а также и его американского кузена из помойного листка в стиле Бауэри, не говоря уж про Новости Падди Келли[], Приключения Пью и нашего недремлющего друга Скиберинского орла. Зачем непременно вспоминать такого мастера адвокатских речей, как Уайтсайд? Довлеет дневи газета его.ОТЗВУКИ ДАВНИХ ДНЕЙ Граттан и Флуд писали вот для этой самой газеты,  выкрикнул редактор ему в лицо.  Патриоты и добровольцы. А теперь вы где? Основана в -м.Доктор Льюкас[]. А кого сейчас можно сравнить с Джоном Филпотом Каррэном[]?Тьфу! Ну, что ж,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой,  вот, скажем, королевский адвокат Буш[]. Буш?  повторил редактор.  Что же, согласен. Буш, я согласен. У него в крови это есть. Кендал Буш, то есть, я хочу сказать, Сеймур Буш. Он бы уже давно восседал в судьях,  сказал профессор,  если бы не Ну ладно, не будем.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой повернулся к Стивену и тихо, с расстановкой сказал: Я думаю, самая отточенная фраза, какую я слышал в жизни, вышла из уст Сеймура Буша. Слушалось дело о братоубийстве, то самое дело Чайлдса. Буш защищал его.И мне в ушную полость влил настой[].Кстати, как же он узнал это? Ведь он умер во сне. Или эту другую историю[], про зверя с двумя спинами? И какова же она была?  спросил профессор.,  [] Он говорил о принципе правосудия на основе доказательств, согласно римскому праву,  сказал ОМоллой.  Он противопоставлял его более древнему Моисееву закону[],  [], и здесь напомнил про Моисея Микеланджело в Ватикане[]. М-да. Несколько тщательно подобранных слов,  возвестил Ленехан.  Тишина!Последовала пауза. Дж.Дж.ОМоллой извлек свой портсигар.Напрасно замерли. Какая-нибудь ерунда.Вестник задумчиво вынул спички и закурил сигару.Позднее я часто думал, оглядываясь назад, на эти странные дни, не это ли крохотное действие, столь само по себе пустое, это чирканье этой спички, определило впоследствии всю судьбу двух наших существований[].ОТТОЧЕННАЯ ФРАЗАДж.Дж.ОМоллой продолжал, оттеняя каждое слово: Он сказал о нем: это музыка, застывшая в мраморе, каменное изваяние, рогатое и устрашающее, божественное в человеческой форме, это вечный символ мудрости и прозрения, который достоин жить, если только достойно жить что-либо, исполненное воображением или рукою скульптора во мраморе, духовно преображенном и преображающем .Волнистое движение его гибкой руки эхом сопровождало фразу. Блестяще!  тотчас отозвался Майлс Кроуфорд. Божественное вдохновение,  промолвил мистер ОМэдден Берк. А вам понравилось?  спросил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой у Стивена.Стивен, плененный до глубины красотой языка и жеста, лишь молча покраснел. Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара, и Дж.Дж.ОМоллой протянул портсигар Майлсу Кроуфорду. Ленехан, как и прежде, дал им прикурить, а потом уцепил трофей, говоря: Премногус благодаримус.ВЫСОКОНРАВСТВЕННЫЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК Профессор Мэйдженнис[] мне говорил про вас,  обратился ОМоллой к Стивену.  Скажите по правде, что вы думаете обо всей этой толпе герметистов, поэтов опалового безмолвия, с верховным мистом А.Э.? Все началось с этой дамы Блаватской. Уж это была замысловатая штучка. В одном интервью, которое он дал какому-то янки[], А.Э. рассказывал, как вы однажды явились к нему чуть свет и стали допытываться о планах сознания[].Мэйдженнис считает, что вы, должно быть, решили попросту разыграть А.Э. Он человек высочайшей нравственности, Мэйдженнис.Говорил обо мне. Но что он сказал? Что он сказал? Что он сказал обо мне? Нет, не спрошу. Спасибо,  сказал профессор Макхью, отклоняя от себя портсигар.  Погодите минуту. Позвольте, я кое-что скажу. Прекраснейшим образцом ораторского искусства, какой я слышал, была речь Джона Ф.Тэйлора[] на заседании университетского исторического общества. Сначала говорил судья Фицгиббон[], теперешний глава апелляционного суда, а обсуждали они нечто довольно новое по тем временам, эссе, где ратовалось за возрождение ирландского языка.Он обернулся к Майлсу Кроуфорду и сказал: Вы ведь знаете Джеральда Фицгиббона, так что можете себе представить стиль его речи. По слухам, он заседает с Тимом Хили[],  вставил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой,  в административной комиссии колледжа Тринити. Он заседает с милым крошкой в детском нагрудничке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Валяйте дальше. Ну и что? Прошу заметить,  продолжал профессор,  что это была речь опытного оратора, с безупречной дикцией, исполненная учтивого высокомерия и изливающая, не скажу чашу гнева, но скорей горделивое презрение к новому движению[]. Тогда это было новым движением. Мы были слабы и, стало быть, ни на что не годны.На мгновение он сомкнул свои тонкие длинные губы, но, стремясь продолжать, поднес широко отставленную руку к очкам и, коснувшись черной оправы подрагивающими пальцами, безымянным и большим, слегка передвинул фокус.ИМПРОВИЗАЦИЯНарочито будничным тоном он обратился к Дж.Дж
