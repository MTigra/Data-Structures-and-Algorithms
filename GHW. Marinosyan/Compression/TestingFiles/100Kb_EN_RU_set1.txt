     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let honeytrickle over a slice of the loafHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf aboutthe loose collar of his tennis shirt spokeI intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of free thoughtHe walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by hisside Its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels Myfamiliar after me calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen A wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their criesechoed dismayA stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor calledHockeyThey broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping themQuickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticksand clamour of their boots and tonguesSargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing anopen copybook His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails bedHe held out his copybook The word Sums was written on theheadline Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signaturewith blind loops and a blot Cyril Sargent his name and sealMr Deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them toyou sirStephen touched the edges of the book FutilityDo you understand how to do them now he askedNumbers eleven to fifteen Sargent answered Mr Deasy said I was tocopy them off the board sirCan you do them yourself Stephen askedNo sirUgly and futile lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink a snailsbed Yet someone had loved him borne him

Sargent peeredaskance through his slanted glasses Hockeysticks rattled in thelumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the fieldAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummeryof their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes Give handstraverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the Moors Gone too fromthe world Averroes and Moses Maimonides dark men in mien

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

hiscopybook back to his benchYou had better get your stick and go out to the others Stephen said ashe followed towards the door the boys graceless formYes sirIn the corridor his name was heard called from the playfieldSargentRun on Stephen said Mr Deasy is calling youHe stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards thescrappy field where sharp voices were in strife They were sorted in teamsand Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feetWhen he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called tohim He turned his angry white moustacheWhat is it now he cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

лестничного проема неся в руках чашку с пеной на которой накрест лежали зеркальце и бритва Желтый халат его враспояску слегка вздымался за ним на мягком утреннем ветеркеОн поднял чашку перед собою и возгласил    Остановясь он вгляделся вниз в сумрак винтовой лестницы и грубо крикнул Выходи Клинк Выходи иезуит несчастныйТоржественно он проследовал вперед и взошел на круглую орудийную площадку Обернувшись по сторонам он с важностью троекратно благословил башню окрестный берег и пробуждающиеся горы Потом увидев Стивена Дедала наклонился к нему и начал быстро крестить воздух булькая горлом и подергивая головой Стивен Дедал недовольный и заспанный облокотясь на последнюю ступеньку холодно смотрел на дергающееся булькающее лицо что благословляло его длинное как у лошади и на бестонзурную шевелюру белесую словно окрашенную под светлый дубБык Маллиган заглянул под зеркальце и тут же опять прикрыл чашку По казармам  скомандовал он суровоИ пастырским голосом продолжал Ибо сие о возлюбленные мои есть истинная Христина тело и кровь печенки и селезенки Музыку медленней пожалуйста Господа закройте глаза Минуту Маленькая заминка знаете с белыми шариками Всем помолчатьОн устремил взгляд искоса вверх издал долгий протяжный призывный свист и замер напряженно прислушиваясь Белые ровные зубы койгде поблескивали золотыми крупинками Златоуст Резкий ответный свист дважды прозвучал в тишине Спасибо старина  живо откликнулся он  Так будет чудненько Можешь выключать токОн соскочил с площадки и с важностью поглядел на своего зрителя собирая у ног складки просторного халата Жирное затененное лицо и тяжелый овальный подбородок напоминали средневекового прелата покровителя искусств Довольная улыбка показалась у него на губах Смех да и только  сказал он весело  Это нелепое твое имя как у древнего грекаТкнув пальцем с дружелюбной насмешкой он отошел к парапету посмеиваясь Стивен Дедал поднявшись до конца лестницы устало побрел за ним но не дойдя уселся на край площадки и принялся наблюдать как тот пристроив на парапете зеркальце и обмакнув в пену помазок намыливает шею и щекиВеселый голос Быка Маллигана не умолкал У меня тоже нелепое  Мэйлахи Маллиган два дактиля Но тут звучит чтото эллинское правда ведь Чтото солнечное и резвое как сам бычок Мы непременно должны поехать в Афины Поедешь если я раздобуду у тетушки двадцать фунтовОн положил помазок и в полном восторге воскликнул Это онто поедет Изнуренный иезуитОборвал себя и начал тщательно бриться Послушай Маллиган  промолвил Стивен негромко Да моя радость Долго еще Хейнс будет жить в башнеБык Маллиган явил над правым плечом свежевыбритую щеку Кошмарная личность а  сказал он от души  Этакий толстокожий сакс Он считает что ты не джентльмен Эти мне гнусные англичане Их так и пучит от денег и от запоров Он видите ли из Оксфорда А знаешь Дедал вот у тебято настоящий оксфордский стиль Он все никак тебя не раскусит Нет лучшее тебе имя придумал я Клинк острый клинокОн выбривал с усердием подбородок Всю ночь бредил про какуюто черную пантеру  проговорил Стивен  Где у него ружье Совсем малый спятил  сказал Маллиган  А ты перетрусил не на шутку Еще бы  произнес Стивен с энергией и нарастающим страхом  В кромешном мраке с какимто незнакомцем который стонет и бредит что надо застрелить пантеру Ты спасал тонущих Но я знаешь ли не герой Если он тут останется я ухожуБык Маллиган глядел насупясь на бритву покрытую мыльной пеной Соскочив со своего возвышения он торопливо стал рыться в карманах брюк Драла  пробормотал он сквозь зубыВернувшись к площадке он запустил руку в верхний карман Стивена и сказал Позвольте одолжиться вашим сморкальником вытереть нашу бритвуСтивен покорно дал ему вытащить и развернуть напоказ держа за угол измятый и нечистый платок Бык Маллиган заботливо вытер лезвие Вслед за этим разглядывая платок он объявил Сморкальник барда Новый оттенок в палитру ирландского стихотворца сопливозеленый Почти ощущаешь вкус правдаОн снова поднялся к парапету и бросил долгий взгляд на залив Ветерок шевелил белокурую под светлый дуб шевелюру Господи  сказал он негромко  Как верно названо море у Элджи седая нежная мать Сопливозеленое море Яйцещемящее море Эпи ойнопа понтонАх эти греки Дедал Надо мне тебя обучить Ты должен прочесть их в подлиннике Талатта Талатта  Наша великая и нежная мать Иди сюда и взгляниСтивен встал и подошел к парапету Перегнувшись он посмотрел вниз на воду и на почтовый пароход выходящий из гавани Кингстауна Наша могущественная мать  произнес Бык МаллиганВнезапно он отвел взгляд от моря и большими пытливыми глазами посмотрел Стивену в лицо Моя тетка считает ты убил свою мать  сказал он  Поэтому она бы мне вообще запретила с тобой встречаться Ктото ее убил  сумрачно бросил Стивен Черт побери Клинк уж на колени ты бы мог стать если умирающая мать просит  сказал Бык Маллиган  Я сам гипербореец не хуже тебя Но это ж подумать только мать с последним вздохом умоляет стать на колени помолиться за нее  и ты отказываешься Нет чтото в тебе зловещееОборвал себя и начал намыливать другую щеку Всепрощающая улыбка тронула его губы Но бесподобный комедиант  шепнул он тихонько  Клинк бесподобнейший из комедиантовОн брился плавно и осмотрительно в истовом молчанииСтивен поставив локоть на шершавый гранит подперев лоб ладонью неподвижно смотрел на обтерханные края своего черного лоснистого рукава Боль что не была еще болью любви саднила сердце его Во сне безмолвно она явилась ему после смерти ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева а дыхание когда она с немым укором склонилась над ним веяло сыростью могильного тлена Поверх ветхой манжеты он видел море которое сытый голос превозносил как великую и нежную мать Кольцо залива и горизонта заполняла тусклозеленая влагаБелый фарфоровый сосуд у ее смертного одра заполняла тягучая зеленая желчь которую она с громкими стонами извергала из своей гниющей печени в приступах мучительной рвотыБык Маллиган заново обтер бритву Эх песбедолага  с участием вздохнул он  Надо бы выдать тебе рубашку да хоть пару сморкальников А как те штаны что купили с рук Как будто впору  отвечал СтивенБык Маллиган атаковал ложбинку под нижней губой Смех да и только  произнес он довольно  Верней будет с ног Дознайся какая там пьянь заразная таскала их У меня есть отличная пара серые в узкую полоску Ты бы в них выглядел потрясающе Нет кроме шуток Клинк Ты очень недурно смотришься когда прилично одет Спасибо  ответил Стивен  Если они серые я их не могу носить Он их не может носить  сказал Бык Маллиган своему отражению в зеркале  Этикет значит этикет Он мать родную убил но серые брюки ни за что не оденетОн сложил аккуратно бритву и легкими касаньями пальцев ощупал гладкую кожуСтивен перевел взгляд с залива на жирное лицо с мутноголубыми бегающими глазами Этот малый с кем я сидел в Корабле прошлый вечер  сказал Бык Маллиган  уверяет у тебя ппс Он в желтом доме работает у Конопли Нормана Прогрессивный паралич со слабоумиемОн описал зеркальцем полукруг повсюду просверкав эту весть солнечными лучами уже сияющими над морем Изогнутые бритые губы кончики блестящих белых зубов смеялись Смех овладел всем его сильным и ладным телом На полюбуйсяка на себя горебард  сказал онСтивен наклонился и глянул в подставленное зеркало расколотое кривой трещиной Волосы дыбом Так взор его и прочих видит меня Кто мне выбрал это лицо Эту паршивую шкуру псабедолаги Оно тоже спрашивает меня Я его стянул у служанки из комнаты  поведал Бык Маллиган  Ей в самый раз такое Тетушка ради Мэйлахи всегда нанимает неказистых Не введи его во искушение И зовутто УрсулойСнова залившись смехом он убрал зеркальце изпод упорного взгляда Стивена Ярость Калибана не видящего в зеркале своего отражения  изрек он Как жалко Уайльд не дожил на тебя поглядетьОтступив и показывая на зеркало Стивен с горечью произнес Вот символ ирландского искусства Треснувшее зеркало служанкиНеожиданно и порывисто Бык Маллиган подхватил Стивена под руку и зашагал с ним вокруг башни позвякивая бритвой и зеркальцем засунутыми в карман Грех тебя так дразнить правда Клинк  сказал он дружески  Видит бог в голове у тебя побольше чем у них всехЕще выпад отбит Скальпель художника страшит его как меня  докторский Хладная сталь пера Треснувшее зеркало служанки Ты это скажи тому олуху из Оксфорда да вытяни из него гинею Он весь провонял деньгами и считает что ты не джентльмен А у самого папаша набил мошну сбывая негритосам слабительное а может еще на каких делишках Эх Клинк если бы мы с тобой действовали сообща уж мы бы коечто сделали для нашего острова Эллинизировали бы егоРука Крэнли Его рука И подумать только ты вынужден побираться у этих свиней Я одинединственный понимаю что ты за человек Почему ж ты так мало мне доверяешь Изза чего все воротишь нос Изза Хейнса Да пусть только пикнет я притащу Сеймура и мы ему закатим трепку еще похлеще чем досталась Клайву КемпторпуКрики юных богатеньких голосов в квартире Клайва Кемпторпа Бледнолицые держатся за бока от хохота хватаются друг за друга ох умора Обри бережно весть эту ей передай Сейчас помру В изрезанной рубашке вьющейся лентами по воздуху в съехавших до полу штанах он спотыкаясь скачет вокруг стола а за ним Эйдс из Магдалины с портновскими ножницами Мордочка ошалелого теленка позолоченная вареньем Не надо не сдирайте штаны Не набрасывайтесь на меня как бешеныеКрики из распахнутого окна вспугивают вечер во дворе колледжа Глухой садовник в фартуке замаскированный лицом Мэтью Арнольда продвигается по темному газону с косилкой вглядываясь в танцующий рой травинокНам самим новое язычество омфал Ладно пусть остается  сказал Стивен  Такто он ничего только по ночам Тогда в чем же дело  наседал Бык Маллиган  Давай рожай Ято ведь напрямик с тобой Что у тебя такое против меняОни остановились глядя туда где тупая оконечность мыса БрэйХед покоилась на воде словно голова спящего кита Стивен осторожно высвободил руку Ты хочешь чтобы я сказал тебе  спросил он Да в чем там дело  повторил Бык Маллиган  Я ничего не припоминаюГоворя это он в упор посмотрел на Стивена Легкий ветерок пробежал по его лицу вороша светлую спутанную шевелюру и зажигая в глазах серебряные искорки беспокойстваСтивен удручаясь собственным голосом сказал Ты помнишь как я пришел к тебе домой в первый раз после смерти материБык Маллиган мгновенно нахмурившись отвечал Как Где Убей не могу припомнить Я запоминаю только идеи и ощущения Ну и что Чего там стряслось бога ради Ты готовил чай  продолжал Стивен  а я пошел на кухню за кипятком Из комнат вышла твоя мать и с ней ктото из гостей Она спросила кто у тебя Ну  не отступал Бык Маллиган  А я что сказал Я уже все забыл А ты сказал  ответил Стивен ему  Да так просто Дедал у которого мамаша подохлаБык Маллиган покраснел и стал казаться от этого моложе и привлекательней Я так сказал  переспросил он  И что же Что тут такогоНервным движением он стряхнул свое замешательство А что потвоему смерть  спросил он  твоей матери или твоя или положим моя Ты видел только как умирает твоя мать А я каждый день вижу как они отдают концы и в Ричмонде и в Скорбящей да после их крошат на потроха в анатомичке Это и называется подох ничего больше И не о чем говорить Ты вот не соизволил стать на колени и помолиться за свою мать когда она просила тебя на смертном одре А почему Да потому что в тебе эта проклятая иезуитская закваска только она проявляется наоборот По мне тут одна падаль и пустая комедия Ее лобные доли уже не действуют Она называет доктора сэр Питер Тизл и хочет нарвать лютиков с одеяла Уж не перечь ей вотвот все кончится Ты сам не исполнил ее предсмертную просьбу а теперь дуешься на меня что я не скулил как наемный плакальщик от Лалуэтта Абсурд Допустим я и сказал так Но я вовсе не хотел оскорбить память твоей материЕго речь вернула ему самоуверенность Стивен скрывая зияющие раны оставленные словами в его сердце как можно суше сказал Я и не говорю что это оскорбляет мою мать Так что же тогда  спросил Бык Маллиган Это оскорбляет меня  был ответБык Маллиган круто повернулся на каблуках Нет невозможный субъект  воскликнул онИ пошел прочь быстрым шагом вдоль парапета Стивен остался на месте недвижно глядя на мыс и на спокойную гладь залива Море и мыс сейчас подернулись дымкой В висках стучала кровь застилая взор и он чувствовал как лихорадочно горят его щекиГромкий голос позвал снизу из башни Маллиган вы где наверху Сейчас иду  откликнулся Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Взгляни на море Что ему до всех оскорблений Бросайка лучше Лойолу Клинк и двигаем вниз Наш сакс поджидает уже свой беконГолова его задержалась на миг над лестницей вровень с крышей И не хандри изза этого целый день У меня же семь пятниц на неделеОставь скорбные думыГолова скрылась но мерный голос продолжал опускаясь доноситься из лестничного проемаНе прячь глаза и не скорбиНад горькой тайною любвиТам Фергус правит в полный ростВладыка медных колесницВ мирном спокойствии утра тени лесов неслышно проплывали от лестничного проема к морю туда куда он глядел У берега и мористей водная гладь белела следами стремительных легких стоп Морской волны белеет грудьПопарные сплетения ударений Рука перебирающая струны арфы рождает сплетения аккордов Слитносплетенных словес словно волн белогрудых мерцаньеОблако медленно наползает на солнце и гуще делается в тени зелень залива Он был за спиной у него сосуд горьких вод Песня Фергуса Я пел ее оставшись дома один приглушая долгие сумрачные аккорды Дверь к ней была открыта она хотела слышать меня Безмолвно с жалостью и благоговением я приблизился к ее ложу Она плакала на своем убогом одре Над этими словами Стивен над горькой тайною любвиГде же теперь Ее секреты в запертом ящичке старые веера из перьев бальные книжечки с бахромой пропитанные мускусом убор из янтарных бус Когда она была девочкой у ее окошка висела на солнце клетка с птицей Она видела старика Ройса в представлении Свирепый турка и вместе со всеми смеялась когда он распевалОткрою вамЧто рад бы самЯ невидимкой статьМимолетные радости заботливо сложенные надушенные мускусомНе прячь глаза и не скорбиСложены в памяти природы вместе с ее детскими игрушками Скорбные воспоминания осаждают его разум Стакан воды из крана на кухне когда она собиралась к причастию Яблоко с сахаром внутри испеченное для нее на плите в темный осенний вечер Ее изящные ногти окрашенные кровью вшей с детских рубашонокВо сне безмолвно она явилась ему ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева ее дыхание когда она склонилась над ним с неслышными тайными словами веяло сыростью могильного тленаЕе стекленеющие глаза уставились из глубин смерти поколебать и сломить мою душу На меня одного Призрачная свеча освещает ее агонию Призрачные блики на искаженном мукой лице Громко раздается ее дыхание хриплое прерывающееся от ужаса и став на колени все молятся Взгляд ее на мне повергнуть меня            Упырь ТрупоедНет мать Отпусти меня Дай мне жить Эгей КлинкГолос Быка Маллигана раздался певуче в глубине башни приблизился долетев от лестницы позвал снова Стивен еще содрогаясь от вопля своей души услышал теплый щедрый солнечный свет и в воздухе за своей спиной дружеские слова Будь паинькой спускайся Дедал Завтрак готов Хейнс извиняется за то что мешал нам спать Все улажено Иду  сказал Стивен оборачиваясь Давай Христа ради  говорил Маллиган  И ради меня и ради всеобщего благаЕго голова нырнула и вынырнула Я ему передал про твой символ ирландского искусства Говорит очень остроумно Вытяни из него фунт идет То бишь гинею Мне заплатят сегодня  сказал Стивен В школьной шарашке  осведомился Маллиган  А сколько Четыре фунта Одолжи нам один Как угодно  отвечал Стивен Четыре сверкающих соверена  вскричал с восторгом Бык Маллиган  Устроим роскошный выпивон на зависть всем раздруидам Четыре всемогущих соверенаВоздев руки он затопал по каменным ступеням вниз фальшиво распевая с лондонским простонародным акцентомВеселье будет допозднаМы хлопнем виски и винаВ день КоронацииМы славно покутимВеселье будет допозднаИ все мы покутимЛучи солнца веселились над морем Забытая никелевая чашка для бритья поблескивала на парапете Почему я должен ее относить Может оставить тут на весь день памятником забытой дружбеОн подошел к ней подержал с минуту в руках осязая ее прохладу чувствуя запах липкой пены с торчащим в ней помазком Так прежде я носил кадило в Клонгоузе Сейчас я другой и всетаки еще тот же Опять слуга Прислужник слугиВ мрачном сводчатом помещении внутри башни фигура в халате бодро сновала у очага то скрывая то открывая желтое его пламя Мягкий дневной свет падал двумя снопами через высокие оконца на вымощенный плитами пол и там где снопы встречались плыло медленно вращаясь облако дыма от горящего угля и горелого жира Этак мы задохнемся  заметил Бык Маллиган  Хейнс вы не откроете дверьСтивен поставил бритвенную чашку на шкафчик Долговязый человек сидевший на подвесной койке направился к порогу и отворил внутреннюю дверь А у вас есть ключ  спросил голос Ключ у Дедала  отозвался Бык Маллиган  Черти лохматые я уже задыхаюсьНе отрывая взгляда от очага он взревел Клинк Ключ в скважине  сказал Стивен подходя ближеКлюч с резким скрежетом дважды повернулся в замке и тяжелая наружная дверь впустила долгожданные свет и воздух Хейнс остановился в дверях глядя наружу Стивен придвинул к столу свой чемодан поставив его торчком и уселся ждать Бык Маллиган шваркнул жарево на блюдо рядом с собой Потом отнес блюдо и большой чайник к столу поставил и вздохнул с облегчением Ах я вся таю  произнес он  как сказала свечка когда Но  тес Про это не будем Клинк проснись Подавай хлеб масло мед Присоединяйтесь Хейнс Кормежка готова Благослови Господи нас и эти дары твои Черт побери молока нетСтивен достал из шкафчика масленку хлеб и горшочек с медом Бык Маллиган усевшись вскипел внезапным негодованием Что за бардак  возмутился он  Я ж ей сказал  прийти в начале девятого Можно и без молока обойтись  сказал Стивен  В шкафчике есть лимон Да пошел ты со своими парижскими замашками  отвечал Бык Маллиган  Я хочу молочка из СэндикоуваХейнс направляясь к ним от дверей сообщил Идет ваша молочница с молоком Благодать божия  воскликнул Бык Маллиган вскакивая со стула  Присаживайтесь Наливайте чай Сахар в пакете А с треклятой яичницей я больше не желаю возитьсяОн кое как раскромсал жарево на блюде и раскидал его по трем тарелкам приговаривая        Хейнс сел и принялся разливать чай Кладу всем по два куска  сказал он  Слушайте Маллиган какой вы крепкий завариваетеБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб щедрыми ломтями замурлыкал умильным старушечьим голоском Как надоть мне чай заваривать уж я так заварю говаривала матушка Гроган А надоть нужду справлять уж так справлю Боже правый вот это чай  сказал ХейнсБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб так же умильно продолжал Уж такой мой обычай миссис Кахилл  это она говорит А миссис Кахилл на это Ахти сударыня только упаси вас Господи делать оба дела в одну посудину На кончике ножа он протянул каждому из сотрапезников по толстому ломтю хлеба Это же фольклор  сказал он очень серьезно  это для вашей книги Хейнс Пять строчек текста и десять страниц комментариев насчет фольклора и рыбообразных божеств Дандрама Издано сестрамиколдуньями в год великого ураганаОн обернулся к Стивену и подняв брови спросил его с крайней заинтересованностью Не можете ли напомнить коллега где говорится про посудину матушки Гроган в Мабиногионе или в упанишадах Отнюдь не уверен  солидно отвечал Стивен В самом деле  продолжал Бык Маллиган прежним тоном  А отчего же будьте любезны Мне думается  сказал Стивен не прерывая еды  этого не найти ни в Мабиногионе ни за его пределами Матушка Гроган по всей вероятности состоит в родстве с Мэри ЭннБык Маллиган расплылся от удовольствия Прелестно  произнес он сюсюкающим и слащавым голосом показывая белые зубы и жмурясь довольно  Вы так полагаете Совершенно прелестноЗатем вдруг нарочито нахмурясь он хрипло скрипуче зарычал рьяно нарезая новые ломтиНа старуху Мэри ЭннЕй плевать с высоких стенНо задравши свой подолНабив рот яичницей он жевал и мычалВ дверях заслоняя свет появилась фигура женщины Молоко сэр Заходите сударыня  сказал Маллиган  Клинк подайка кувшинСтарушка вошла и остановилась около Стивена Славное утречко сэр  сказала она  Слава Богу Комукому  спросил Маллиган поглядев на нее  Ах да конечноСтивен протянув руку за спину достал из шкафчика молочный кувшин Наши островитяне  заметил Маллиган Хейнсу как бы вскользь  нередко поминают сборщика крайней плоти Сколько сэр  спросила старушка Одну кварту  ответил СтивенОн смотрел как она наливает в мерку а оттуда в кувшин густое белое молоко не свое Старые сморщенные груди Она налила еще мерку с избыткомДревняя и таинственная она явилась из утреннего мира быть может вестницей Наливая молоко она расхваливала его В сочных лугах чуть свет она уже доила сидя на корточках ведьма на поганке скрюченные пальцы проворны у набухшего вымени Мычанием встречала ее привычный приход скотинка шелковая от росы Бедная старушка шелковая коровка  такие прозвища давались ей в старину Старухастранница низший род бессмертных служащая своему захватчику и своему беззаботному обманщику познавшая измену обоих вестница тайны утра Служить или укорять он не знал однако гнушался заискивать перед нею И впрямь прекрасное сударыня  согласился Бык Маллиган наливая им в чашки молоко Вы сэр отведайте  сказала онаУступая ей он сделал глоток Если бы все мы могли питаться такой вот здоровой пищей  объявил он звучно  в этой стране не было бы столько гнилых зубов и гнилых кишок А то живем в болоте едим дешевую дрянь а улицы вымощены навозом пылью и чахоточными плевками А вы сэр на доктора учитесь  спросила старушка Да сударыня  ответил Бык МаллиганСтивен слушал храня презрительное молчание Она покорно внимает зычному голосу своего костоправа и врачевателя меня она знать не знаетГолосу который отпустит ей грехи и помажет для погребения ее тело кроме женских нечистых чресл сотворенное из плоти мужской не по подобию Божию в добычу змею И тому голосу что сейчас заставляет ее умолкнуть с удивлением озираясь Вы понимаете что он говорит  осведомился у нее Стивен Это вы пофранцузски сэр  спросила старушка ХейнсаХейнс с апломбом обратил к ней новую тираду еще длинней Это поирландски  объяснил Бык Маллиган  Вы гэльский знаете Я так и думала по звуку это ирландский  сказала она  А вы не с запада сэр Я англичанин  ответил Хейнс Он англичанин  повторил Бык Маллиган  и он считает в Ирландии надо говорить поирландски Нет спору надо  сказала старушка  мне и самой стыд что не умею на нашем языке А люди умные говорят языкто великий Великий  это не то слово  заявил Бык Маллиган  Он абсолютно великолепен Плесни нам еще чайку Клинк Не хотите ли чашечку сударыня Нет сэр спасибо  отвечала старушка повесив на руку бидон и собираясь идтиХейнс обратился к ней А счет у вас есть Маллиган надо бы заплатить верноСтивен снова наполнил чашки Счет сэр  неуверенно переспросила она  Это значит семь дней по пинте по два пенса это семь раз по два это шиллинг два пенса да эти три дня по кварте по четыре пенса будет три кварты это выходит шиллинг да там один и два всего два и два сэрБык Маллиган вздохнул и отправив в рот горбушку густо намазанную маслом с обеих сторон вытянул вперед ноги и начал рыться в карманах Платить подобает с любезным видом  сказал улыбаясь ХейнсСтивен налил третью чашку слегка закрасив ложечкой чая густое жирное молоко Бык Маллиган выудил из кармана флорин и повертев его в пальцах воскликнул О чудоОн пододвинул флорин по столу к старушке приговаривая Радость моя для тебя все что имею отдамСтивен вложил монету в ее нежадную руку За нами еще два пенса  заметил он Это не к спеху сэр  уверяла она убирая монету  Совсем не к спеху Всего вам доброго сэрПоклонившись она ушла напутствуемая нежным речитативом Быка Маллигана Я бы с восторгом весь мирК милым повергнул стопамОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Серьезно Дедал Я совсем на мели Беги в свою школьную шарашку да принеси оттуда малость деньжонок Сегодня бардам положено пить и пировать Ирландия ожидает что в этот день каждый выполнит свой долг Что до меня  заметил Хейнс поднимаясь  то я должен сегодня посетить вашу национальную библиотеку Сперва поплавать  заявил Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и самым учтивым тоном спросил Не сегодня ли Клинк день твоего ежемесячного омовенияИ пояснил обращаясь к Хейнсу Оный нечистый бард имеет правило мыться один раз в месяц Всю Ирландию омывает Гольфстрим  промолвил Стивен поливая хлеб струйкой медаХейнс отозвался из угла легким узлом повязывая шейный платок под открытым воротом спортивной рубашки Я буду собирать ваши изречения если вы позволитеОбращено ко мне Они моются банятся оттираются Жагала сраму Совесть А пятно все на месте Это отлично сказано что треснувшее зеркало служанки  символ ирландского искусстваБык Маллиган толкнув Стивена ногой под столом задушевно пообещал Погодите Хейнс вот вы еще послушаете его о Гамлете Нет я в самом деле намерен  продолжал Хейнс обращаясь к Стивену  Я как раз думал на эту тему когда пришло это ветхое создание А я чтонибудь заработаю на этом  спросил СтивенХейнс рассмеялся и сказал снимая мягкую серую шляпу с крюка на котором была подвешена койка Чего не знаю того не знаюНеторопливо он направился к двери Бык Маллиган перегнулся к Стивену и грубо с нажимом прошипел Не можешь без своих штучек Для чего ты это ему А что  возразил Стивен  Задача  раздобыть денег У кого У него или у молочницы Помоему орел или решка Я про тебя ему уши прожужжал  не отставал Бык Маллиган  а тут извольте ты со своим вшивым злопамятством да замогильными иезуитскими шуточками У меня нет особой надежды  заметил Стивен  как на него так и на нееБык Маллиган трагически вздохнул и положил руку Стивену на плечо Лишь на меня Клинк  произнес онИ совсем другим голосом добавил Честно признаться я и сам считаю ты прав На хрена они кроме этого сдались Чего ты их не морочишь как я Пошли они все к ляду Надо выбираться из этого бардакаОн встал важно распустил пояс и совлек с себя свой халат произнося отрешенным тоном И был Маллиган разоблачен от одежд егоСодержимое карманов он выложил на стол со словами Вот тебе твой соплюшникИ надевая жесткий воротничок и строптивый галстук стыдил их и укорял а с ними и запутавшуюся часовую цепочку Руки его нырнув в чемодан шарили там покуда он требовал себе чистый носовой платок Жагала сраму Клянусь богом мы же обязаны поддерживать репутацию Желаю бордовые перчатки и зеленые башмаки Противоречие Я противоречу себе Ну что же значит я противоречу себе Ветреник Малахия Его говорливые руки метнули мягкий черный снаряд И вот твоя шляпа в стиле Латинского КварталаСтивен поймал ее и надел на голову Хейнс окликнул их от дверей Друзья вы двигаетесь Я готов  отозвался Бык Маллиган идя к двери  Пошли Клинк Кажется ты уже все доел после насОтрешенный и важный проследовал он к порогу не без прискорбия сообщая И пойдя вон плюхнулся с горкиСтивен взяв ясеневую тросточку стоявшую у стены тронулся за ним следом Выйдя на лестницу он притянул неподатливую стальную дверь и запер ее Гигантский ключ сунул во внутренний карманУ подножия лестницы Бык Маллиган спросил А ты ключ взял Да он у меня  отвечал
