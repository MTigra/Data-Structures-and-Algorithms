    -- I --Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. Heheld the bowl aloft and intoned:--INTROIBO AD ALTARE DEI.Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:--Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and theawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat andshaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair,grained and hued like pale oak.Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartly.--Back to barracks! he said sternly.He added in a preachers tone:--For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul andblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, thenpaused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calm.--Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off thecurrent, will you?He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher,gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middleages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.--The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neck.Buck Mulligans gay voice went on.--My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has aHellenic ring, hasnt it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. Wemust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twentyquid?He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:--Will he come? The jejune jesuit!Ceasing, he began to shave with care.--Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.--Yes, my love?--How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.--God, isnt he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinksyoure not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with moneyand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, youhave the real Oxford manner. He cant make you out. O, my name for youis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.He shaved warily over his chin.--He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where ishis guncase?--A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?--I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the darkwith a man I dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting ablack panther. You saved men from drowning. Im not a hero, however. Ifhe stays on here I am off.Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.--Scutter! he cried thickly.He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket, said:--Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:--The bards noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.You can almost taste it, cant you?He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, hisfair oakpale hair stirring slightly.--God! he said quietly. Isnt the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweetmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. EPI OINOPA PONTON.Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in theoriginal. THALATTA! THALATTA! She is our great sweet mother. Come andlook.Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it helooked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouthof Kingstown.--Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephensface.--The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with you.--Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.--You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying motherasked you, Buck Mulligan said. Im hyperborean as much as you. But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you ...He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerantsmile curled his lips.--But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliestmummer of them all!He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoat-sleeve. Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faintodour of wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.--Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt anda few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?--They fit well enough, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.--The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. Godknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hairstripe, grey. Youll look spiffing in them. Im not joking, Kinch. Youlook damn well when youre dressed.--Thanks, Stephen said. I cant wear them if they are grey.--He cant wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he cant wear greytrousers.He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skin.Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyes.--That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, saysyou have g.p.i. Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. Generalparalysis of the insane!He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunk.--Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleftby a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose thisface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.--I pinched it out of the skivvys room, Buck Mulligan said. It does herall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Leadhim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyes.--The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. IfWilde were only alive to see you!Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:--It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust them.--Its not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. Godknows you have more spirit than any of them.Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. Thecold steelpen.--Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairsand touch him for a guinea. Hes stinking with money and thinks yourenot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus orsome bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only worktogether we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.Cranlys arm. His arm.--And to think of your having to beg from these swine. Im the only onethat knows what you are. Why dont you trust me more? What have you upyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here Ill bringdown Seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave CliveKempthorpe.Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpes rooms. Palefaces:they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, Ishall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slitribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table,with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailorsshears. A scared calfs face gilded with marmalade. I dont want to bedebagged! Dont you play the giddy ox with me!Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. Adeaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnolds face, pushes hismower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes ofgrasshalms.To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos.--Let him stay, Stephen said. Theres nothing wrong with him except atnight.--Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. Imquite frank with you. What have you against me now?They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay onthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his armquietly.--Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.--Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I dont remember anything.He looked in Stephens face as he spoke. A light wind passed hisbrow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyes.Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:--Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeath?Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:--What? Where? I cant remember anything. I remember only ideas andsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?--You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to getmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.--Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.--You said, Stephen answered, O, ITS ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER ISBEASTLY DEAD.A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose toBuck Mulligans cheek.--Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?He shook his constraint from him nervously.--And what is death, he asked, your mothers or yours or my own? Yousaw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater andRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. Its a beastlything and nothing else. It simply doesnt matter. You wouldnt kneel downto pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Becauseyou have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only its injected the wrongway. To me its all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are notfunctioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercupsoff the quilt. Humour her till its over. You crossed her last wish indeath and yet you sulk with me because I dont whinge like some hired mutefrom Lalouettes. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didnt mean to offendthe memory of your mother.He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gapingwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:--I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.--Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.--Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.--O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland nowgrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and hefelt the fever of his cheeks.A voice within the tower called loudly:--Are you up there, Mulligan?--Im coming, Buck Mulligan answered.He turned towards Stephen and said:--Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, levelwith the roof:--Dont mope over it all day, he said. Im inconsequent. Give up themoody brooding.His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed outof the stairhead:    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD   UPON LOVES BITTER MYSTERY   FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS.Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from thestairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror ofwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of thedim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking theharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded wordsshimmering on the dim tide.A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay indeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus song: Isang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her doorwas open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went toher bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen:loves bitter mystery.Where now?Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered withmusk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in thesunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce singin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when hesang:    I AM THE BOY    THAT CAN ENJOY    INVISIBILITY.Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD.Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories besethis brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she hadapproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roastingfor her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernailsreddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts.In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within itsloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. Onme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on thetortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayedon their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TECONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT.Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!No, mother! Let me be and let me live.--Kinch ahoy!Buck Mulligans voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer upthe staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his souls cry,heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.--Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines isapologising for waking us last night. Its all right.--Im coming, Stephen said, turning.--Do, for Jesus sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all oursakes.His head disappeared and reappeared.--I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says its very clever. Touchhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.--I get paid this morning, Stephen said.--The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend usone.--If you want it, Stephen said.--Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. Well have aglorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing outof tune with a Cockney accent:    O, WONT WE HAVE A MERRY TIME,    DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE!    ON CORONATION,    CORONATION DAY!    O, WONT WE HAVE A MERRY TIME    ON CORONATION DAY!Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it thereall day, forgotten friendship?He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. SoI carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yetthe same. A servant too. A server of a servant.In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligansgowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding andrevealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across theflagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays acloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.--Well be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from thehammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled openthe inner doors.--Have you the key? a voice asked.--Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, Im choked!He howled, without looking up from the fire:--Kinch!--Its in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door hadbeen set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at thedoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table andsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set themdown heavily and sighed with relief.--Im melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... But, hush! Not aword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Wheresthe sugar? O, jay, theres no milk.Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercoolerfrom the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.--What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.--We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. Theres a lemon in thelocker.--O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycovemilk.Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:--That woman is coming up with the milk.--The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from hischair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, Icant go fumbling at the damned eggs.He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on threeplates, saying:--IN NOMINE PATRIS ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI.Haines sat down to pour out the tea.--Im giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you domake strong tea, dont you?Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an oldwomans wheedling voice:--When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when Imakes water I makes water.--By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:--SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. BEGOB, MAAM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SENDYOU DONT MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT.He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread,impaled on his knife.--Thats folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five linesof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting hisbrows:--Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?--I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.--Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?--I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of MaryAnn.Buck Mulligans face smiled with delight.--Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth andblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in ahoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  --FOR OLD MARY ANN    SHE DOESNT CARE A DAMN.    BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ...He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.The doorway was darkened by an entering form.--The milk, sir!--Come in, maam, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.An old woman came forward and stood by Stephens elbow.--Thats a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.--To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.--The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently ofthe collector of prepuces.--How much, sir? asked the old woman.--A quart, Stephen said.He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug richwhite milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measurefuland a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe amessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouchingby a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool,her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about herwhom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman,names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortalserving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, amessenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether hecould not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.--It is indeed, maam, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.--Taste it, sir, she said.He drank at her bidding.--If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhatloudly, we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust,horsedung and consumptives spits.--Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.--I am, maam, Buck Mulligan answered.--Look at that now, she said.Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voicethat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me sheslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there isof her but her womans unclean loins, of mans flesh made not in Godslikeness, the serpents prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her besilent with wondering unsteady eyes.--Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.--Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.--Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?--I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from thewest, sir?--I am an Englishman, Haines answered.--Hes English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irishin Ireland.--Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and Im ashamed I dont speak thelanguage myself. Im told its a grand language by them that knows.--Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fillus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, maam?--No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of themilkcan on her forearm and about to go.Haines said to her:--Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadnt we?Stephen filled again the three cups.--Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, its seven mornings a pint attwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these threemornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. Thats ashilling and one and two is two and two, sir.Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crustthickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began tosearch his trouser pockets.--Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thickrich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in hisfingers and cried:--A miracle!He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:--Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.--Well owe twopence, he said.--Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,sir.She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligans tenderchant:  --HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE,    MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET.He turned to Stephen and said:--Seriously, Dedalus. Im stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bringus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expectsthat every man this day will do his duty.--That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit yournational library today.--Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:--Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?Then he said to Haines:--The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.--All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honeytrickle over a slice of the loaf.Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf aboutthe loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:--I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.Conscience. Yet heres a spot.--That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced good.Buck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of tone:--Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.--Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.--Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock, said:--I dont know, Im sure.He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigour:--You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?--Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From themilkwoman or from him. Its a toss up, I think.--I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.--I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens arm.--From me, Kinch, he said.In a suddenly changed tone he added:--To tell you the Gods truth I think youre right. Damn all else theyare good for. Why dont you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Letus get out of the kip.He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown,saying resignedly:--Mulligan is stripped of his garments.He emptied his pockets on to the table.--Theres your snotrag, he said.And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, wellsimply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots.Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradictmyself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghands.--And theres your Latin quarter hat, he said.Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from thedoorway:--Are you coming, you fellows?--Im ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:--And going forth he met Butterly.Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them outand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:--Did you bring the key?--I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.--Down, sir! How dare you, sir!Haines asked:--Do you pay rent for this tower?--Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.--To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:--Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?--Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were onthe sea. But ours is the omphalos.--What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.--No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait tillI have a few pints in me first.He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoat:--You couldnt manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?--It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.--You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?--Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.Its quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfather.--What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bendingin loose laughter, said to Stephens ear:--O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!--Were always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it israther long to tell.Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.--The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.--I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA, ISNT IT?Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.--Its a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.The seas ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the Muglins.--I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with theFather.Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. Helooked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. Hemoved a dolls head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  --IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD.    MY MOTHERS A JEW, MY FATHERS A BIRD.    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE.    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY.He held up a forefinger of warning.  --IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN.He tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and, runningforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  --GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD.    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE!He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, flutteringhis winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephenand said:--We oughtnt to laugh, I suppose. Hes rather blasphemous. Im not abeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow, doesnt it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?--The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.--O, Haines said, you have heard it before?--Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.--Youre not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in thenarrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal God.--Theres only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.--Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang itopen too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his hands.--Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe oryou dont, isnt it? Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod. You dont stand for that, I suppose?--You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horribleexample of free thought.He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by hisside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. Myfamiliar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along thepath. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants thatkey. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him thekey too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.--After all, Haines began ...Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured himwas not all unkind.--After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are yourown master, it seems to me.--I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.--Italian? Haines said.A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.--And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.--Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?--The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, andthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before hespoke.--I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must thinklike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you ratherunfairly. It seems history is to blame.The proud potent titles clanged over Stephens memory the triumphof their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAMECCLESIAM: the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rarethoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass forpope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: andbehind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed andmenaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry:Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius,warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with theFather, and Valentine, spurning Christs terrene body, and the subtleAfrican heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His ownSon. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: amenace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of thechurch, Michaels host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict withtheir lances and their shields.Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. ZUT! NOM DE DIEU!--Of course Im a Britisher, Hainess voice said, and I feel as one. Idont want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.Thats our national problem, Im afraid, just now.Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,boatman.--Shes making for Bullock harbour.The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.--Theres five fathoms out there, he said. Itll be swept up that waywhen the tide comes in about one. Its nine days today.The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank baywaiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,saltwhite. Here I am.They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulliganstood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over hisshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowlyfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.--Is the brother with you, Malachi?--Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.--Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet youngthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.--Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot upnear the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, waterrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his blacksagging loincloth.Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing atHaines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at browand lips and breastbone.--Seymours back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur ofrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.--Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.--Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?--Yes.--Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto withmoney.--Is she up the pole?--Better ask Seymour that.--Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, sayingtritely:--Redheaded women buck like goats.He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.--My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. Im the ubermench. Toothless Kinchand I, the supermen.He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where hisclothes lay.--Are you going in here, Malachi?--Yes. Make room in the bed.The young man shoved himself backward through the water andreached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat downon a stone, smoking.--Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.--Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.Stephen turned away.--Im going, Mulligan, he said.--Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heapedclothes.--And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing.Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:--He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spakeZarathustra.His plump body plunged.--Well see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the pathand smiling at wild Irish.Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.--The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.--Good, Stephen said.He walked along the upwardcurving path.    LILIATA RUTILANTIUM.    TURMA CIRCUMDET.    IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM.The priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I willnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head,a seals, far out on the water, round.Usurper.    * * * * * * *--You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?--Tarentum, sir.--Very good. Well?--There was a battle, sir.--Very good. Where?The boys blank face asked the blank window.Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if notas memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blakes wingsof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and topplingmasonry, and time one livid final flame. Whats left us then?--I forget the place, sir.  B. C.--Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarredbook.--Yes, sir. And he said: ANOTHER VICTORY LIKE THAT AND WE ARE DONE FOR.That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind.From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.--You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?--End of Pyrrhus, sir?--I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.--Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrongs satchel. He curled thembetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered tothe tissue of his lips. A sweetened boys breath. Welloff people, proudthat their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.--Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong lookedround at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they willlaugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papaspay.--Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boys shoulder with the book,what is a pier.--A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of abridge. Kingstown pier, sir.Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the backbench whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever beeninnocent. All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty,Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, theirbracelets tittering in the struggle.--Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.The words troubled their gaze.--How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.For Hainess chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amidwild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? Ajester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning aclement masters praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly forthe smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other toooften heard, their land a pawnshop.Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in Argos or Julius Caesarnot been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time hasbranded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinitepossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeingthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave,weaver of the wind.--Tell us a story, sir.--O, do, sir. A ghoststory.--Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.--WEEP NO MORE, Comyn said.--Go on then, Talbot.--And the story, sir?--After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under thebreastwork of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances atthe text:  --WEEP NO MORE, WOFUL SHEPHERDS, WEEP NO MORE    FOR LYCIDAS, YOUR SORROW, IS NOT DEAD,    SUNK THOUGH HE BE BENEATH THE WATERY FLOOR ...It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.Aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated outinto the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he hadread, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow adelicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brainsabout me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and inmy minds darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy ofbrightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought ofthought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: thesoul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form offorms.Talbot repeated:  --THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT OF HIM THAT WALKED THE WAVES,    THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT ...--Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I dont see anything.--What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again,having just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also overthese craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lipsand on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of thetribute. To Caesar what is Caesars, to God what is Gods. A long lookfrom dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchslooms. Ay.    RIDDLE ME, RIDDLE ME, RANDY RO.    MY FATHER GAVE ME SEEDS TO SOW.Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.--Have I heard all? Stephen asked.--Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.--Half day, sir. Thursday.--Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabblinggaily:--A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.--O, ask me, sir.--A hard one, sir.--This is the riddle, Stephen said:    THE COCK CREW,    THE SKY WAS BLUE:    THE BELLS IN HEAVEN    WERE STRIKING ELEVEN.    TIS TIME FOR THIS POOR SOUL    TO GO TO HEAVEN.What is that?--What, sir?--Again, sir. We didnt hear.Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silenceCochrane said:--What is it, sir? We give it up.Stephen, his throat itching, answered:--The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their criesechoed dismay.A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:--Hockey!They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticksand clamour of their boots and tongues.Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing anopen copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped,recent and damp as a snails bed.He held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on theheadline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signaturewith blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.--Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them toyou, sir.Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.--Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.--Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was tocopy them off the board, sir.--Can you do them. yourself? Stephen asked.--No, sir.Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snailsbed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, asquashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained fromher own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mothersprostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was nomore: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour ofrosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampledunderfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven:and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur,with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up theearth, listened, scraped and scraped.Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves byalgebra that Shakespeares ghost is Hamlets grandfather. Sargent peeredaskance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in thelumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummeryof their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too fromthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien andmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of theworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could notcomprehend.--Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?--Yes, sir.In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for aword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hueof shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective andobjective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed himand hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. Mychildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of theirtyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.The sum was done.--It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.--Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried hiscopybook back to his bench.--You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said ashe followed towards the door the boys graceless form.--Yes, sir.In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.--Sargent!--Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards thescrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teamsand Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called tohim. He turned his angry white moustache.--What is it now? he cried continually without listening.--Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.--Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restoreorder here.And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternly:--What is the matter? What is it now?Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many formsclosed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyedhead.Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abradedleather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. Asit was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuartcoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in theirspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached toall the gentiles: world without end.A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out hisrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.--First, our little financial settlement, he said.He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. Itslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laidthem carefully on the table.--Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephens embarrassed handmoved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and moneycowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emirs turban, andthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrims hoard, dead treasure,hollow shells.A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.--Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is forshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.--Three twelve, he said. I think youll find thats right.--Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shyhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.--No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.Stephens hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbolstoo of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greedand misery.--Dont carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. Youll pull it out somewhereand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. Youll find them veryhandy.Answer something.--Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Threetimes now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in thisinstant if I will.--Because you dont save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You dontknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as Ihave. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?PUT BUT MONEY IN THY PURSE.--Iago, Stephen murmured.He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare.--He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes,but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Doyou know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from anEnglishmans mouth?The seas ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seemshistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.--That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.--Ba! Mr Deasy cried. Thats not English. A French Celt said that. Hetapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.--I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I PAIDMY WAY.Good man, good man.--I PAID MY WAY. I NEVER BORROWED A SHILLING IN MY LIFE. Can you feelthat? I OWE NOTHING. Can you?Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, BobReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, fiveweeks board. The lump I have is useless.--For the moment, no, Stephen answered.Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.--I knew you couldnt, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. Weare a generous people but we must also be just.--I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece atthe shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince ofWales.--You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. Isaw three generations since OConnells time. I remember the faminein . Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of theunion twenty years before OConnell did or before the prelates of yourcommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond inArmagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked andarmed, the planters covenant. The black north and true blue bible.Croppies lie down.Stephen sketched a brief gesture.--I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But Iam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are allIrish, all kings sons.--Alas, Stephen said.--PER VIAS RECTAS, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for itand put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.    LAL THE RAL THE RA    THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN.A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!Soft day, your honour! ... Day! ... Day! ... Two topboots jog danglingon to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.--That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice andread off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.--Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, THE DICTATES OF COMMONSENSE. Just a moment.He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by hiselbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboardslowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, theirmeek heads poised in air: lord Hastings Repulse, the duke ofWestminsters Shotover, the duke of Beauforts Ceylon, PRIX DE PARIS,. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds,backing kings colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.--Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of thisallimportant question ...Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners amongthe mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches andreek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Evenmoney the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers wehurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past themeatfaced woman, a butchers dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.Shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle.Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in amedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mothers darling whoseems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock byshock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of theslain, a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts.--Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.--I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. Its about thefoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinionson the matter.May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of LAISSEZ FAIREwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our oldindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of thechannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department ofagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman whowas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.--I dont mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.Foot and mouth disease. Known as Kochs preparation. Serum andvirus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperors horses atMurzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price.Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportantquestion. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thankingyou for the hospitality of your columns.--I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at thenext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can becured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it isregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offerto come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department.Now Im going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties,by ... intrigues by ... backstairs influence by ...He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.--Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of thejews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are thesigns of a nations decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nationsvital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we arestanding here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.Old England is dying.He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed abroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.--Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.    THE HARLOTS CRY FROM STREET TO STREET    SHALL WEAVE OLD ENGLANDS WINDINGSHEET.His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam inwhich he halted.--A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew orgentile, is he not?--They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can seethe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on theearth to this day.On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quotingprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silkhats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their fullslow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knewthe rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patienceto heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by theroadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years ofwandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.--Who has not? Stephen said.--What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fellsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.--History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?--The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All humanhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:--That is God.Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!--What? Mr Deasy asked.--A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nosetweaked between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.--I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors andmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was nobetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten yearsthe Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangersto our shore here, MacMurroughs wife and her leman, ORourke, prince ofBreffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures butnot the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I willfight for the right till the end.    FOR ULSTER WILL FIGHT    AND ULSTER WILL BE RIGHT.Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.--Well, sir, he began ...--I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long atthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong.--A learner rather, Stephen said.And here what will you learn more?Mr Deasy shook his head.--Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the greatteacher.Stephen rustled the sheets again.--As regards these, he began.--Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have thempublished at once.TELEGRAPH. IRISH HOMESTEAD.--I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editorsslightly.--That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at theCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You seeif you can get it into your two papers. What are they?--THE EVENING TELEGRAPH ...--That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have toanswer that letter from my cousin.--Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.Thank you.--Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I liketo break a lance with you, old as I am.--Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under thetrees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dubme a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.--Mr Dedalus!Running after me. No more letters, I hope.--Just one moment.--Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.--I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour ofbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that?No. And do you know why?He frowned sternly on the bright air.--Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.--Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it arattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, hislifted arms waving to the air.--She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as hestamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. Thats why.On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flungspangles, dancing coins.    * * * * * * *Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thoughtthrough my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn andseawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then hewas aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking hissconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, MAESTRODI COLOR CHE SANNO. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane,adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, ifnot a door. Shut your eyes and see.Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack andshells.

All days make their end.By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all theglad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentlemanpoet. GIA. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont,gentleman journalist. Gia. My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder. Feel.That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, withthat money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, Iwonder, or does it mean something perhaps?My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didnt. Better buy one.He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,carefully. For the rest let look who will.Behind. Perhaps there is someone.He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving throughthe air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on thecrosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.+    -- II -- Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts andfowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods roes. Most of all heliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang offaintly scented urine.Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly,righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and airwere in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.Made him feel a bit peckish.The coals were reddening.Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didnt likeher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off thehob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, itsspout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stifflyround a leg of the table with tail on high.--Mkgnao!--O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of thetable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch myhead. Prr.Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean tosee: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of hertail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on hisknees.--Milk for the pussens, he said.--Mrkgnao! the cat cried.They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than weunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel.Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I looklike to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.--Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of thechookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.--Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintivelyand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslitsnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to thedresser, took the jug Hanlons milkman had just filled for him, pouredwarmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.--Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tippedthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them theycant mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kindof feelers in the dark, perhaps.He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs withthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for amutton kidney at Buckleys. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better apork kidney at Dlugaczs. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower,then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lapbetter, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, pausedby the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread andbutter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.He said softly in the bare hall:--Im going round the corner. Be back in a minute.And when he had heard his voice say it he added:--You dont want anything for breakfast?A sleepy soft grunt answered:--Mn.No. She didnt want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh,softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedsteadjingled. Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it.Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governors auction. Got ashort knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevnathat was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and Im proud of it. Still he hadbrains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoatand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickybackpictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plastos highgrade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip ofpaper. Quite safe.On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled thehalldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gentlyover the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come backanyhow.He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of numberseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of Georges church. Be a warmday I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Blackconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldnt go in thatlight suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as hewalked in happy warmth. Bolands breadvan delivering with trays our dailybut she prefers yesterdays loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes youfeel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travelround in front of the sun, steal a days march on him. Keep it up for evernever grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land,come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedys bigmoustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awnedstreets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man,Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries ofsellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Danderalong all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on tosundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with ascroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I passon. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls herchildren home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged.Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Mollys new garters. Strings. Listen.A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.I pass.Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track ofthe sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. WhatArthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the FREEMAN leader: ahomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bankof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sunrising up in the north-west.He approached Larry ORourkes. From the cellar grating floated upthe flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted outwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the endof the city traffic. For instance MAuleys down there: n. g. as position.Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from thecattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him foran ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, mybold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching theaproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes himoff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what Im going to tellyou? Whats that, Mr ORourke? Do you know what? The Russians,theyd only be an eight oclock breakfast for the Japanese.Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing aboutpoor Dignam, Mr ORourke.Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through thedoorway:--Good day, Mr ORourke.--Good day to you.--Lovely weather, sir.--Tis all that.Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates fromthe county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, loand behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thinof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublinwithout passing a pub. Save it they cant. Off the drunks perhaps. Putdown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs anddrabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with thetown travellers. Square it you with the boss and well split the job, see?How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say tenbarrels of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passedSaint Josephs National school. Brats clamour. Windows open. Fresh airhelps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouveedoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At theirjoggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.He halted before Dlugaczs window, staring at the hanks of sausages,polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened inhis mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packedwith forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarmbreath of cooked spicy pigs blood.A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. Hestood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, callingthe items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and ahalf of Dennys sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods hisname is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followersallowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. Shedoes whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped offwith blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfedheifer.He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm atKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal wintersanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it,blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read itnearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A youngwhite heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing intheir pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders inhobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on aripemeated hindquarter, theres a prime one, unpeeled switches in theirhands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will,his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whackby whack.The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up herprime sausages and made a red grimace.--Now, my miss, he said.She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.--Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,please?Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if shewent slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in themorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stoodoutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sigheddown his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crustedtoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. Thesting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another:a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable.Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, Im lost in the wood.--Threepence, please.His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them onthe rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc bydisc, into the till.--Thank you, sir. Another time.A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew hisgaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.--Good morning, he said, moving away.--Good morning, sir.No sign. Gone. What matter?He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. AgendathNetaim: planters company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkishgovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel andconstruction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. Youpay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificialirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name enteredfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and thebalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse , Berlin, W. .Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowderedolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars,eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows thetaste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too.Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevins parade. And Mastiansky withthe old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citronsbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it tothe nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moiseltold me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must bewithout a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chapticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soileddungarees. Theres whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesnt see. Chapyou know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegiancaptains. Wonder if Ill meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke therain. On earth as it is in heaven.A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the deadsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift thosewaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called itraining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All deadnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore theoldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidys, clutching anaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over allthe earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being borneverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an oldwomans: the grey sunken cunt of the world.Desolation.Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket heturned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along hisveins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I amhere now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong sideof the bed. Must begin again those Sandows exercises. On the hands down.Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell thegentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her amplebedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, inslim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, agirl with gold hair on the wind.Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gatheredthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.Mrs Marion.--Poldy!Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked throughwarm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.--Who are the letters for?He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.--A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And aletter for you.He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve ofher knees.--Do you want the blind up?Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw herglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.--That do? he asked, turning.She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.--She got the things, she said.He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself backslowly with a snug sigh.--Hurry up with that tea, she said. Im parched.--The kettle is boiling, he said.But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiledlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:--Poldy!--What?--Scald the teapot.On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. Hescalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea,tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw hetook off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watchedthe lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the catmewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she wont mouse. Saythey wont eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall toher and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. Hesprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: BlazesBoylans seaside girls.The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crownDerby, smiling. Silly Millys birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces offolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.    O, MILLY BLOOM, YOU ARE MY DARLING.    YOU ARE MY LOOKINGGLASS FROM NIGHT TO MORNING.    ID RATHER HAVE YOU WITHOUT A FARTHING    THAN KATEY KEOGH WITH HER ASS AND GARDEN.Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was acourteous old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off theplatform. And the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly broughtit into the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwins hat! Allwe laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted theteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried itupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set iton the chair by the bedhead.--What a time you were! she said.She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow onthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large softbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder. The warmth ofher couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the teashe poured.A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In theact of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.--Who was the letter from? he asked.Bold hand. Marion.--O, Boylan, she said. Hes bringing the programme.--What are you singing?--LA CI DAREM with J. C. Doyle, she said, and LOVES OLD SWEET SONG.Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leavesnext day. Like foul flowerwater.--Would you like the window open a little?She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:--What time is the funeral?--Eleven, I think, he answered. I didnt see the paper.Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soileddrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round astocking: rumpled, shiny sole.--No: that book.Other stocking. Her petticoat.--It must have fell down, she said.He felt here and there. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. Wonder if she pronouncesthat right: VOGLIO. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped andlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of theorangekeyed chamberpot.--Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. Theres a word I wanted to askyou.She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search thetext with the hairpin till she reached the word.--Met him what? he asked.--Here, she said. What does that mean?He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.--Metempsychosis?--Yes. Whos he when hes at home?--Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. Its Greek: from the Greek. Thatmeans the transmigration of souls.--O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same youngeyes. The first night after the charades. Dolphins Barn. He turned overthe smudged pages. RUBY: THE PRIDE OF THE RING. Hello. Illustration.Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floornaked. Sheet kindly lent. THE MONSTER MAFFEI DESISTED AND FLUNG HISVICTIM FROM HIM WITH AN OATH. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals.Trapeze at Henglers. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping.

Dignams soul ...--Did you finish it? he asked.--Yes, she said. Theres nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with thefirst fellow all the time?--Never read it. Do you want another?--Yes. Get another of Paul de Kocks. Nice name he has.She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.Must get that Capel street library book renewed or theyll write toKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: thats the word.--Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another bodyafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we alllived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Betteremind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. Anexample?The BATH OF THE NYMPH over the bed. Given away with the Easternumber of PHOTO BITS: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before youput milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six Igave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Nakednymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.He turned the pages back.--Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. Theyused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, forinstance. What they called nymphs, for example.Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,inhaling through her arched nostrils.--Theres a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?--The kidney! he cried suddenly.He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toesagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, steppinghastily down the stairs with a flurried storks legs. Pungent smoke shotup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the forkunder the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only alittle burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scantybrown gravy trickle over it.Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. Heshore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkfulinto his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Doneto a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped onein the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some youngstudent and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading itslowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raisingit to his mouth.    Dearest PapliThanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits mesplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummysIovely box of creams and am writing.

Not much. Still, she might doworse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler teato wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing hashappened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild pieceof goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now.Vain: very.He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day Icaught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.

Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has thefidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with herback to the fire too.He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,undoing the waistband of his trousers.

Hope no ape comes knocking justas Im.In the tabledrawer he found an old number of TITBITS. He folded itunder his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in softbounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.Listening, he heard her voice:--Come, come, pussy. Come.He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listentowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.The maid was in the garden.

Enthusiast.He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to getthese trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head underthe low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewashand stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peeredthrough a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in hiscountinghouse. Nobody.Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pagesover on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep ita bit.

About a million barrels all the same.An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. Thebungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl ofliquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.

Like to see them sittinground in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap itup like milk, I suppose.The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet placeto be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slowmusic. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in thebenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch kneltat the altarrails.

He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook adrop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then thenext one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into hermouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes andopen your mouth. What? CORPUS: body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin.Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They dont seem to chew it:only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibalscotton to it.He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one byone, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself inits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. Weought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here andthere, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it tomelt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: its that sort ofbread: unleavened shewbread.

Wake this time next year.He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneelan instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the laceaffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldnt know what todo to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered,it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn upwith a veil and black bag.

By the way, did I tear up that envelope?Yes: under the bridge.The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregssmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drankwhat they are used to Guinnesss porter or some temperance beverageWheatleys Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochranes ginger ale(aromatic). Doesnt give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Coldcomfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise theyd have one old booserworse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the wholeatmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to makethat instrument talk, the VIBRATO: fifty pounds a year they say he had inGardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the STABAT MATER ofRossini. Father Bernard Vaughans sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ,but dont keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped.Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:QUIS EST HOMO.Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven lastwords. Mozarts twelfth mass: GLORIA in that. Those old popes keen onmusic, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina forexample too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too,chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. GreenChartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bitthick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their ownstrong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldnt feel anything after.Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, dont they? Gluttons, tall,long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face aboutand bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloomglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand upat the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and hesat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar,holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each otherin Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:--O God, our refuge and our strength ...Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throwthem the bone. I remember slightly.

Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or thephlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Cleverof nature.--About a fortnight ago, sir?--Yes, Mr Bloom said.He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, thedusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling youraches and pains.--Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and thenorangeflower water ...It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.--And white wax also, he said.Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up toher eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in mycuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for theteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.Skinfood. One of the old queens sons, duke of Albany was it? had only oneskin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make itworse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? PEAU DESPAGNE.That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Purecurd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage.Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also Ithink I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water.Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh thenall the day. Funeral be rather glum.--Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought abottle?--No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. Ill call later in the day andIll take one of these soaps. How much are they?--Fourpence, sir.Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.--Ill take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.--Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when youcome back.--Good, Mr Bloom said.He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit,the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.At his armpit Bantam Lyons voice and hand said:--Hello, Bloom. Whats the best news? Is that todays? Show us a minute.Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. Tolook younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.Bantam Lyonss yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wantsa wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pearssoap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.--I want to see about that French horse thats running today, BantamLyons said. Where the bugger is it?He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.Barbers itch. Tight collar hell lose his hair. Better leave him thepaper and get shut of him.--You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.--Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximumthe second.--I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.--Whats that? his sharp voice said.--I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it awaythat moment.Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspreadsheets back on Mr Blooms arms.--Ill risk it, he said. Here, thanks.He sped off towards Conways corner. God speed scut.Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged thesoap in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed ofit lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for largetender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Flemingembezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. Theynever come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind youof a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. Heeyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubledup like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like awheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.Something to catch the eye.Theres Hornblower standing at the porters lodge. Keep him onhands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, MrHornblower? How do you do, sir?Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They cant play it here.Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildarestreet club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line.And the skulls we were acracking when MCarthy took the floor.Heatwave. Wont last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in thestream of life we trace is dearer than them all.Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentletepid stream. This is my body.He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb ofwarmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk andlimbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bushfloating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands,a languid floating flower.    * * * * * * *Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creakingcarriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in afterhim, curving his height with care.--Come on, Simon.--After you, Mr Bloom said.Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:Yes, yes.--Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door toafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an armthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow atthe lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passedover. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us gowe give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger incorners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear hed wake. Then getting itready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it moreto your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead.Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bitin an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I amsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shiftit out of that. Wait for an opportunity.All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: thennearer: then horses hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creakingand swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blindsof the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.At walking pace.They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and werepassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheelsrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shookrattling in the doorframes.--What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.--Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.--Thats a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted bypassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smootherroad past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad inmourning, a wide hat.--Theres a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.--Who is that?--Your son and heir.--Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippeduproadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and,swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:--Was that Mulligan cad with him? His FIDUS ACHATES!--No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.--Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Gouldingfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papas little lump ofdung, the wise child that knows her own father.Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: thebottleworks: Dodder bridge.Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward hecalls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was.Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, thelandladys two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironinghis back. Thinks hell cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.About six hundred per cent profit.--Hes in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is acontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinksall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother Ill makeit my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or hisaunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. Illtickle his catastrophe, believe you me.He cried above the clatter of the wheels:--I wont have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumpersson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul MSwineys. Not likely.He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Powersmild face and Martin Cunninghams eyes and beard, gravely shaking.Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something tohand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in thehouse. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes.Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been thatmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogsat it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up.She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us atouch, Poldy. God, Im dying for it. How life begins.Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son insideher. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.Learn German too.--Are we late? Mr Power asked.--Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumpingJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, shes a dear girl. Soonbe a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a womantoo. Life, life.The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.--Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.--He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadnt that squint troubling him. Doyou follow me?He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush awaycrustcrumbs from under his thighs.--What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?--Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Powersaid.All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewedbuttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowneddownward and said:--Unless Im greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?--It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feetquite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.--After all, he said, its the most natural thing in the world.--Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peakof his beard gently.--Yes, Mr Bloom answered. Hes behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.--And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.--At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.--I met MCoy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said hed try to come.The carriage halted short.--Whats wrong?--Were stopped.--Where are we?Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.--The grand canal, he said.Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly nevergot it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles.Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Dontmiss this chance. Dogs home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. Adying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old mens dogsusually are.A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant ofshower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through acolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.--The weather is changing, he said quietly.--A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.--Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. Theres the sun again coming out.Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun,hurled a mute curse at the sky.--Its as uncertain as a childs bottom, he said.--Were off again.The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayedgently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.--Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard takinghim off to his face.--O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,Simon, on Ben Dollards singing of THE CROPPY BOY.--Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. HIS SINGING OF THAT SIMPLEBALLAD, MARTIN, IS THE MOST TRENCHANT RENDERING I EVER HEARD IN THE WHOLECOURSE OF MY EXPERIENCE.--Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. Hes dead nuts on that. And theretrospective arrangement.--Did you read Dan Dawsons speech? Martin Cunningham asked.--I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?--In the paper this morning.Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I mustchange for her.--No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.Mr Blooms glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning thedeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, whatPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleynes? no, Sexton,Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief ofhis. Aged  after a long and tedious illness. Months mind: Quinlan.On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.    IT IS NOW A MONTH SINCE DEAR HENRY FLED    TO HIS HOME UP ABOVE IN THE SKY    WHILE HIS FAMILY WEEPS AND MOURNS HIS LOSS    HOPING SOME DAY TO MEET HIM ON HIGH.I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it inthe bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled.Before my patience are exhausted.National school. Meades yard. The hazard. Only two there now.Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trottinground with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raisedtheir hats.A pointsmans back straightened itself upright suddenly against atramway standard by Mr Blooms window. Couldnt they invent somethingautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellowwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a jobmaking the new invention?Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with acrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in lawperhaps.They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Marks, under the railwaybridge, past the Queens theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton,Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I.Or the LILY OF KILLARNEY? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerfulchange. Wet bright bills for next week. FUN ON THE BRISTOL. MartinCunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink ortwo. As broad as its long.Hes coming in the afternoon. Her songs.Plastos. Sir Philip Cramptons memorial fountain bust. Who was he?--How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his browin salute.--He doesnt see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?--Who? Mr Dedalus asked.--Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.Just that moment I was thinking.Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank thewhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his righthand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimesfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am justlooking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bitsofty. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I supposethe skin cant contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But theshape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night ofthe dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacantglance over their faces.Mr Power asked:--How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?--O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. Its a goodidea, you see ...--Are you going yourself?--Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to thecounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour thechief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.--Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.Have you good artists?--Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, well have alltopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, infact.--And MADAME, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness andclasped them. Smith OBrien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriagewheeling by Farrells statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, hismouth opening: oot.--Four bootlaces for a penny.Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Humestreet. Same house as Mollys namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor forWaterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourningtoo. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.OCallaghan on his last legs.And MADAME. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.Doing her hair, humming. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. No. VORREI E NON. Lookingat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. MI TREMA UN POCO IL.Beautiful on that TRE her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.There is a word throstle that expresses that.His eyes passed lightly over Mr Powers goodlooking face. Greyishover the ears. MADAME: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about thewoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it toldme, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out prettyquick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound ofrumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jurys. Or the Moira, was it?They passed under the hugecloaked Liberators form.Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.--Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the cornerof Elverys Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.--In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:--The devil break the hasp of your back!Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window asthe carriage passed Grays statue.--We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.His eyes met Mr Blooms eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:--Well, nearly all of us.Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces.--Thats an awfully good one thats going the rounds about Reuben J andthe son.--About the boatman? Mr Power asked.--Yes. Isnt it awfully good?--What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didnt hear it.--There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to sendhim to the Isle of Man out of harms way but when they were both ...--What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?--Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he triedto drown ...--Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.--No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself ...Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:--Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on theirway to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose andover the wall with him into the Liffey.--For Gods sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?--Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole andfished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to thefather on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.--Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is ...--And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin forsaving his sons life.A stifled sigh came from under Mr Powers hand.--O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.--Isnt it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.--One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.Mr Powers choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.Nelsons pillar.--Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!--We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Dedalus sighed.--Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldnt grudge us a laugh.Many a good one he told himself.--The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with hisfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last andhe was in his usual health that Id be driving after him like this. Hesgone from us.--As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He wentvery suddenly.--Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.He tapped his chest sadly.Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a rednose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spentcolouring it.Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.--He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.--The best death, Mr Bloom said.Their wide open eyes looked at him.--No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.No-one spoke.Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,temperance hotel, Falconers railway guide, civil service college, Gills,catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. Atnight too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late FatherMathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotundacorner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. Amourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors.Dun for a nun.--Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.A dwarfs face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudys was. Dwarfsbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly societypays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby.Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If its healthy its from the mother.If not from the man. Better luck next time.--Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. Its well out of it.The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattlehis bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.--In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.--But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.--The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.--Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. Wemust take a charitable view of it.--They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.--It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunninghamslarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.Like Shakespeares face. Always a good word to say. They have nomercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. Theyused to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if itwasnt broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in theriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of awife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning thefurniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of thedamned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh.Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that nightDedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering withMartins umbrella.    AND THEY CALL ME THE JEWEL OF ASIA,    OF ASIA,    THE GEISHA.He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. Theroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight throughthe slats of the Venetian blind. The coroners sunlit ears, big and hairy.Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellowstreaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict:overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.--We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.--God grant he doesnt upset us on the road, Mr Power said.--I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrowin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.--Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sentover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybodyhere seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from SAUL. Hes as badas old Antonio.  He left me on my ownio.  Pirouette!  The MATERMISERICORDIAE. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward forincurables there. Very encouraging. Our Ladys Hospice for the dying.Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They lookterrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with thespoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young studentthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. Hes gone over to the lying-inhospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriagegalloped round a corner: stopped.--Whats wrong now?A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing,slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clottedbony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleatingtheir fear.--Emigrants, Mr Power said.--Huuuh! the drovers voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.Huuuh! out of that!Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe soldthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef forold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarterlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in ayear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off thetrain at Clonsilla.The carriage moved on through the drove.--I cant make out why the corporation doesnt run a tramline from theparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken intrucks down to the boats.--Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quiteright. They ought to.--Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to havemunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the lineout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage andall. Dont you see what I mean?--O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloondiningroom.--A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.--Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldnt it be moredecent than galloping two abreast?--Well, theres something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.--And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldnt have scenes like that whenthe hearse capsized round Dunphys and upset the coffin on to the road.--That was terrible, Mr Powers shocked face said, and the corpse fellabout the road. Terrible!--First round Dunphys, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.--Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. PaddyDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit toolarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking whats upnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insidesdecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.--Dunphys, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.Dunphys corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect well pull uphere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.Elixir of life.But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him inthe knocking about? He would and he wouldnt, I suppose. Depends onwhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. Itwould be better to bury them in red: a dark red.In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearsetrotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on hisdropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock aslacktethered horse. Aboard of the BUGABU.Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floatedon his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds ofreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycledown. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at theauction but a ladys. Developing waterways. James MCanns hobby to rowme oer the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Campingout. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing.Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock toDublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown strawhat, saluting Paddy Dignam.They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.--I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.--Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.--How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?--Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.The carriage steered left for Finglas road.The stonecutters yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit ofland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder andsculptor.Passed.On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sextons, an old tramp sat,grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrownyawning boot. After lifes journey.Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.Mr Power pointed.--That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.--So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.Murdered his brother. Or so they said.--The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.--Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. Thats the maxim ofthe law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocentperson to be wrongfully condemned.They looked. Murderers ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfullycondemned. Murder. The murderers image in the eye of the murdered.They love reading about it. Mans head found in a garden. Her clothingconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.Murder will out.Cramped in this carriage. She mightnt like me to come that waywithout letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them oncewith their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid thetrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vaingestures on the air.The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. MartinCunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved thedoor open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalusfollowed.Change that soap now. Mr Blooms hand unbuttoned his hip pocketswiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchiefpocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his otherhand still held.Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. Its all the same.Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits.Who ate them? Mourners coming out.He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed,Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse andtook out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.Where is that childs funeral disappeared to?A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay agranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at itwith his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing ona bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here everyday? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome forthe protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour.Too many in the world.Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawedharpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girls face stained withdirt and tears, holding the womans arm, looking up at her for a sign tocry. Fishs face, bloodless and livid.The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. Somuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First thestiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followedwith their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.All walked after.Martin Cunningham whispered:--I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.--What? Mr Power whispered. How so?--His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had theQueens hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.Anniversary.--O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyesfollowed towards the cardinals mausoleum. Speaking.--Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.--I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.--How many children did he leave?--Five. Ned Lambert says hell try to get one of the girls into Todds.--A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.--A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.--Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.Has the laugh at him now.He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She hadoutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One mustoutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in theworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope youll soon followhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet whoknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn ona guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But inthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts.All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance.Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. Itnever comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no morein her warm bed.--How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haventseen you for a month of Sundays.--Never better. How are all in Corks own town?--I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, NedLambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.--And how is Dick, the solid man?--Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.--By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?--Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till theinsurance is cleared up.--Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?--Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wifes brother. John Henry Menton isbehind. He put down his name for a quid.--Ill engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he oughtto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.--How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?--Many a good mans fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stoodbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair andat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was hethere when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last momentand recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe threeshillings to OGrady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin intothe chapel. Which end is his head?After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screenedlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellowcandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying awreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mournersknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the fontand, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from hispocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently onhis left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out througha door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with onehand, balancing with the other a little book against his toads belly.Wholl read the book? I, said the rook.They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his bookwith a fluent croak.Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. DOMINE-NAMINE.Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woebetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burstsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on himlike a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burstsideways.--NON INTRES IN JUDICIUM CUM SERVO TUO, DOMINE.Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiemmass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning inthe gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toadtoo. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air ofthe place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of badgas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburghslovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffinssometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. Onewhiff of that and youre a goner.My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. Thats better.The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boysbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end andshook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As youwere before you rested. Its all written down: he has to do it.--ET NE NOS INDUCAS IN TENTATIONEM.The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would bebetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, ofcourse ...Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fedup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day afresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead inchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girlswith little sparrows breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thingover them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.--IN PARADISUM.Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoistedthe coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. CornyKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. Allfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom camelast folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at theground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheelsground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt bootsfollowed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustnt lilt here.--The OConnell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.Mr Powers soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.--Hes at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O. But hisheart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!--Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. Ill soon be stretchedbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a littlein his walk. Mr Power took his arm.--Shes better where she is, he said kindly.--I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is inheaven if there is a heaven.Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners toplod by.--Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.--The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we cando so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.They covered their heads.--The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, dont you think?Mr Kernan said with reproof.Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secreteyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We arethe last. In the same boat. Hope hell say something else.Mr Kernan added:--The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, moreimpressive I must say.Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.Mr Kernan said with solemnity:--I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. That touches a mans inmost heart.--It does, Mr Bloom said.Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by twowith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of bloodevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots ofthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn thething else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead.That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth,Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then everyfellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of histraps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder ina skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.--Everything went off A, he said. What?He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policemans shoulders. Withyour tooraloom tooraloom.--As it should be, Mr Kernan said.--What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.Mr Kernan assured him.--Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. Iknow his face.Ned Lambert glanced back.--Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, thesoprano. Shes his wife.--O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I havent seen her for some time.he was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeengolden years ago, at Mat Dillons in Roundtown. And a good armful shewas.He looked behind through the others.--What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasnt he in the stationery line?I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.Ned Lambert smiled.--Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Helys. A traveller for blottingpaper.--In Gods name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon likethat for? She had plenty of game in her then.--Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.John Henry Mentons large eyes stared ahead.The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed amongthe grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched theircaps.--John OConnell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.Mr OConnell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:--I am come to pay you another visit.--My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I dont want yourcustom at all.Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at MartinCunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back.--Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?--I did not, Martin Cunningham said.They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. Thecaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke ina discreet tone to their vacant smiles.--They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggyevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked forMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsingabout in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks speltout the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statueof Our Saviour the widow had got put up.The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. Heresumed:--And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, NOT A BLOODY BIT LIKE THEMAN, SAYS HE. THATS NOT MULCAHY, says he, WHOEVER DONE IT.Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, acceptingthe dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.--Thats all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.--I know, Hynes said. I know that.--To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. Its pure goodheartedness:damn the thing else.Mr Bloom admired the caretakers prosperous bulk. All want to be ongood terms with him. Decent fellow, John OConnell, real good sort. Keys:like Keyess ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. HABEASCORPUS. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I writeBallsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writingto Martha? Hope its not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the betterof a shave. Grey sprouting beard. Thats the first sign when the hairscome out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey.Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It mightthrill her first. Courting death ... Shades of night hovering here withall the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyardsyawn and Daniel OConnell must be a descendant I suppose who is this usedto say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a biggiant in the dark. Will o the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mindoff it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her aghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, Ihave. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.Still theyd kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkishgraveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a youngwidow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice ofpleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet.Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to thestarving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting todo it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him fieldafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sittingor kneeling you couldnt. Standing? His head might come up some day aboveground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the groundmust be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass andedgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is.Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppiesgrowing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardensare just over there. Its the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every manhis price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluablefor fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditorand accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.With thanks.I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rotquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowykind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out ofthem. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they arego on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feedon feed on themselves.But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simplyswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty littleseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense ofpower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about thebulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven  a.m. this morning.  p.m.(closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the menanyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know whats infashion. A juicy pear or ladies punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep outthe damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggersin HAMLET. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Darent jokeabout the dead for two years at least. DE MORTUIS NIL NISI PRIUS. Go outof mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke.Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you secondwind. New lease of life.--How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.--Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased totrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, steppingwith care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set itsnose on the brink, looping the bands round it.Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June.He doesnt know who is here nor care.Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?Now who is he Id like to know? Now Id give a trifle to know who he is.Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on hislonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still hed have to get someone tosod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Onlyman buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. SayRobinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. EveryFriday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.    O, POOR ROBINSON CRUSOE!    HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO SO?Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think ofthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They couldinvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellows. Theyre soparticular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land.Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see whatit means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. TheIrishmans house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the sameidea.Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the baredheads. Twelve. Im thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.Deaths number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasnt in thechapel, that Ill swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I hadone like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he wasonce. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit ofmine turned by Mesias. Hello. Its dyed. His wife I forgot hes notmarried or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on thegravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.Pause.If we were all suddenly somebody else.Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one,they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper.The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietlyin the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindlycaretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which willgo next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. Its the moment you feel.Must be damned unpleasant. Cant believe it at first. Mistake must be:someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I havent yet.Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Wouldyou like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all youhid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press hislower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are thesoles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on thefloor since hes doomed. Devil in that picture of sinners death showinghim a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of LUCIA.SHALL I NEVERMORE BEHOLD THEE? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. Peopletalk about you a bit: forget you. Dont forget to pray for him.Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Thenthey follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping youre welland not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into thefire of purgatory.Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you dowhen you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboys warning.Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,poor mamma, and little Rudy.The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clayin on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive allthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, ofcourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to havesome law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock ora telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag ofdistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as wellto get shut of them as soon as you are sure theres no.The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Hadenough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, coveringthemselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portlyfigure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure ofhis ground, he traversed the dismal fields.Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But heknows them all. No: coming to me.--I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is yourchristian name? Im not sure.--L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down MCoys name too.He asked me to.--Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the FREEMAN once.So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine theyknow. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a fewads. Charley, youre my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well,does no harm. I saw to that, MCoy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged.Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.--And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow wasover there in the ...He looked around.--Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?--MIntosh, Hynes said scribbling. I dont know who he is. Is thathis name?He moved away, looking about him.--No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!Didnt hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well ofall the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. GoodLord, what became of him?A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.--O, excuse me!He stepped aside nimbly.Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested theirspades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreathagainst a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers puton their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Thenknocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from thehaft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on withshouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the graveheadanother coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turningaway, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir:trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths,staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.--Let us go round by the chiefs grave, Hynes said. We have time.--Let us, Mr Power said.They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe MrPowers blank voice spoke:--Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filledwith stones. That one day he will come again.Hynes shook his head.--Parnell will never come again, he said. Hes there, all that was mortalof him. Peace to his ashes.Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels,crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcasteyes, old Irelands hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money onsome charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Doesanybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot.Then lump them together to save time. All souls day. Twentyseventh Illbe at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free ofweeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Neardeaths door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did itof their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket.More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright.I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or awomans with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a countrychurchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or ThomasCampbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murrens.The great physician called him home. Well its Gods acre for them.Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot tohave a quiet smoke and read the CHURCH TIMES. Marriage ads they nevertry to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical.The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing.Immortelles.A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like thewedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, adaisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to besideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland wasdedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why thisinfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket offruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.Apollo that was.How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.As you are now so once were we.Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well,the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep itin the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagainhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photographreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldnt remember the face afterfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that diedwhen I was in Wisdom Helys.Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait.There he goes.An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving thepebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The greyalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.Good hidingplace for treasure.Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. RobertEmmet was buried here by torchlight, wasnt he? Making his rounds.Tail gone now.One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick thebones clean no matter who it was.

Or bury at sea.Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water.Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. Butbeing brought back to life no. Cant bury in the air however. Out of aflying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is letdown. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldnt besurprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before hes well dead.Got wind of Dignam. They wouldnt care about the smell of it. Saltwhitecrumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I washere was Mrs Sinicos funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. Andeven scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I readof to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with runninggravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you afterdeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you afterdeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like thatother world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. Theyare not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.Mat Dillons long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag outthat evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure flukeof mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at firstsight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.--Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.They stopped.--Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.--There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton tookoff his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on hiscoatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.--Its all right now, Martin Cunningham said.John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.--Thank you, he said shortly.They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drewbehind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law.Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, withouthis seeing it.Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.Get the pull over him that way.Thank you. How grand we are this morning!    * * * * * * *    IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLISBefore Nelsons pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, startedfor Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harolds Cross. The hoarse DublinUnited Tramway Companys timekeeper bawled them off:--Rathgar and Terenure!--Come on, Sandymount Green!Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and asingledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glidedparallel.--Start, Palmerston Park!    THE WEARER OF THE CROWNUnder the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called andpolished. Parked in North Princes street His Majestys vermilionmailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESSGrossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Princesstores and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery floatbumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out ofPrinces stores.--There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.--Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and Ill take it round to theTELEGRAPH office.The door of Ruttledges office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minutein a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed outwith a roll of papers under his cape, a kings courier.Red Murrays long shears sliced out the advertisement from thenewspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.--Ill go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.--Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behindhis ear, we can do him one.--Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. Ill rub that in.We.    WILLIAM BRAYDEN,    ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNTRed Murray touched Mr Blooms arm with the shears and whispered:--Brayden.Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as astately figure entered between the newsboards of the WEEKLY FREEMAN ANDNATIONAL PRESS and the FREEMANS JOURNAL AND NATIONAL PRESS. DullthuddingGuinnesss barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by anumbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back ascended eachstep: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalussays. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat,neck.--Dont you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.The door of Ruttledges office whispered: ee: cree. They always buildone door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary,Martha. Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.--Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.--Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of OurSaviour.Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on hisheart. In MARTHA.    CO-OME THOU LOST ONE,    CO-OME THOU DEAR ONE!    THE CROZIER AND THE PEN--His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counterand stepped off posthaste with a word:--FREEMAN!Mr Bloom said slowly:--Well, he is one of our saviours also.A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as hepassed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,along the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?Thumping. Thumping.He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewnpacking paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towardsNannettis reading closet.    WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION    OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESSHynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump.This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines.Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. Hismachineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.    HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUTMr Bloom halted behind the foremans spare body, admiring a glossy crown.Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Memberfor College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it wasworth. Its the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news inthe official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in theyear one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis,barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant tostatute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported fromBallina. Nature notes. Cartoons.

The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures.Shapely bathers on golden strand. Worlds biggest balloon. Double marriageof sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other.Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump.Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them theydclank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.--Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of thesheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently overthe dirty glass screen.--Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.Mr Bloom stood in his way.--If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,pointing backward with his thumb.--Did you? Hynes asked.--Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and youll catch him.--Thanks, old man, Hynes said. Ill tap him too.He hurried on eagerly towards the FREEMANS JOURNAL.Three bob I lent him in Meaghers. Three weeks. Third hint.    WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORKMr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannettis desk.--Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.--He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.The foreman moved his pencil towards it.--But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wantstwo keys at the top.Hell of a racket they make. He doesnt hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.Maybe he understands what I.The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow,began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.--Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.Let him take that in first.Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw theforemans sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond theobedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles ofit unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: varioususes, thousand and one things.Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drewswiftly on the scarred woodwork.    HOUSE OF KEY(E)S--Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.Better not teach him his own business.--You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the topin leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think thats a good idea?The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratchedthere quietly.--The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from theisle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. Butthen if he didnt know only make it awkward for him. Better not.--We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?--I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a housethere too. Ill just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just alittle par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensedpremises. Longfelt want. So on.The foreman thought for an instant.--We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months renewal.A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check itsilently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watchingthe silent typesetters at their cases.    ORTHOGRAPHICALWant to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunninghamforgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing toview the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of aharassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pearunder a cemetery wall. Silly, isnt it? Cemetery put in of course onaccount of the symmetry.I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I oughtto have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could havesaid. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward itsflyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almosthuman the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in itsown way. Sllt.    NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTORThe foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:--Wait. Wheres the archbishops letter? Its to be repeated in theTELEGRAPH. Wheres whats his name?He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.--Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.--Ay. Wheres Monks?--Monks!Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.--Then Ill get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and youll give it agood place I know.--Monks!--Yes, sir.Three months renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Tryit anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge.Tourists over for the show.    A DAYFATHERHe walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he musthave put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ads,speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now.Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank Id say. Wife a good cookand washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, nodamn nonsense.    AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVERHe stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practicethat. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, readingbackwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, Odear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land ofEgypt and into the house of bondage ALLELUIA. SHEMA ISRAEL ADONAI ELOHENU.No, thats the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacobs sons. And then thelamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and thedog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.Justice it means but its everybody eating everyone else. Thats what lifeis after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seemsto see with his fingers.Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery onto the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catchhim out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citronshouse. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.    ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAPHe went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all overthose walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasysmell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thoms next doorwhen I was there.He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, thesoap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back hishandkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into thehip pocket of his trousers.What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram:something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.A sudden screech of laughter came from the EVENING TELEGRAPH office. Knowwho that is. Whats up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.He entered softly.    ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA--The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully tothe dusty windowpane.Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambertsquizzing face, asked of it sourly:--Agonising Christ, wouldnt it give you a heartburn on your arse?Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:--OR AGAIN, NOTE THE MEANDERINGS OF SOME PURLING RILL AS IT BABBLES ONITS WAY, THO QUARRELLING WITH THE STONY OBSTACLES, TO THE TUMBLING WATERSOF NEPTUNES BLUE DOMAIN, MID MOSSY BANKS, FANNED BY GENTLEST ZEPHYRS,PLAYED ON BY THE GLORIOUS SUNLIGHT OR NEATH THE SHADOWS CAST OER ITSPENSIVE BOSOM BY THE OVERARCHING LEAFAGE OF THE GIANTS OF THE FOREST. Whatabout that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. Hows thatfor high?--Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:--THE PENSIVE BOSOM AND THE OVERARSING LEAFAGE. O boys! O boys!--And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking againon the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.--That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I dont want tohear any more of the stuff.He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off Isee. Rather upsets a mans day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or hisgreatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death writtenthis long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself.Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges EyreChatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days.Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.--Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.--What is it? Mr Bloom asked.--A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answeredwith pomp of tone. OUR LOVELY LAND.    SHORT BUT TO THE POINT--Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.--Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With anaccent on the whose.--Dan Dawsons land Mr Dedalus said.--Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.Ned Lambert nodded.--But listen to this, he said.The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door waspushed in.--Excuse me, J. J. OMolloy said, entering.Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.--I beg yours, he said.--Good day, Jack.--Come in. Come in.--Good day.--How are you, Dedalus?--Well. And yourself?J. J. OMolloy shook his head.    SADCleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. Whats inthe wind, I wonder. Money worry.--OR AGAIN IF WE BUT CLIMB THE SERRIED MOUNTAIN PEAKS.--Youre looking extra.--Is the editor to be seen? J. J. OMolloy asked, looking towards theinner door.--Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. Hes inhis sanctum with Lenehan.J. J. OMolloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back thepink pages of the file.Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debtsof honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. andT. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleevelike the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for theEXPRESS with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began onthe INDEPENDENT. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about whenthey get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the samebreath. Wouldnt know which to believe. One story good till you hear thenext. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.Hail fellow well met the next moment.--Ah, listen to this for God sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. OR AGAIN IF WEBUT CLIMB THE SERRIED MOUNTAIN PEAKS ...--Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflatedwindbag!--Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, TOWERING HIGH ON HIGH, TO BATHE OUR SOULS,AS IT WERE ...--Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is hetaking anything for it?--AS TWERE, IN THE PEERLESS PANORAMA OF IRELANDS PORTFOLIO, UNMATCHED,DESPITE THEIR WELLPRAISED PROTOTYPES IN OTHER VAUNTED PRIZE REGIONS, FORVERY BEAUTY, OF BOSKY GROVE AND UNDULATING PLAIN AND LUSCIOUS PASTURELANDOF VERNAL GREEN, STEEPED IN THE TRANSCENDENT TRANSLUCENT GLOW OF OUR MILDMYSTERIOUS IRISH TWILIGHT ...    HIS NATIVE DORIC--The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.--THAT MANTLES THE VISTA FAR AND WIDE AND WAIT TILL THE GLOWING ORB OFTHE MOON SHINE FORTH TO IRRADIATE HER SILVER EFFULGENCE ...--O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions!Thatll do, Ned. Life is too short.He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushymoustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. Aninstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHughsunshaven blackspectacled face.--Doughy Daw! he cried.    WHAT WETHERUP SAIDAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hotcake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasnt he? Why they callhim Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to thatchap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Geta grip of them by the stomach.The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face,crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyesstared about them and the harsh voice asked:--What is it?--And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.--Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.--Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drinkafter that.--Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.--Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editors blue eyes rovedtowards Mr Blooms face, shadowed by a smile.--Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.    MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED--North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. Wewon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!--Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance athis toecaps.--In Ohio! the editor shouted.--So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.Passing out he whispered to J. J. OMolloy:--Incipient jigs. Sad case.--Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.My Ohio!--A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.    O, HARP EOLIAN!He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breakingoff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonantunwashed teeth.--Bingbang, bangbang.Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.--Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.He went in.--What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, comingto the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.--Thatll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.Hello, Jack. Thats all right.--Good day, Myles, J. J. OMolloy said, letting the pages he held sliplimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?The telephone whirred inside.--Twentyeight ... No, twenty ... Double four ... Yes.    SPOT THE WINNERLenehan came out of the inner office with SPORTS tissues.--Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.Madden up.He tossed the tissues on to the table.Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the doorwas flung open.--Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringingurchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down thesteps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the airblue scrawls and under the table came to earth.--It wasnt me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.--Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. Theres a hurricaneblowing.Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as hestooped twice.--Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was PatFarrell shoved me, sir.He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.--Him, sir.--Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.J. J. OMolloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:--Continued on page six, column four.--Yes, EVENING TELEGRAPH here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Isthe boss ...? Yes, TELEGRAPH ... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms ?...Aha! I see ... Right. Ill catch him.    A COLLISION ENSUESThe bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly andbumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.--PARDON, MONSIEUR, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and makinga grimace.--My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? Im in ahurry.--Knee, Lenehan said.He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:--The accumulation of the ANNO DOMINI.--Sorry, Mr Bloom said.He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. OMolloyslapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, amouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on thedoorsteps:  --WE ARE THE BOYS OF WEXFORD    WHO FOUGHT WITH HEART AND HAND.    EXIT BLOOM--Im just running round to Bachelors walk, Mr Bloom said, about this adof Keyess. Want to fix it up. They tell me hes round there in Dillons.He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.--Begone! he said. The world is before you.--Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.J. J. OMolloy took the tissues from Lenehans hand and read them,blowing them apart gently, without comment.--Hell get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through hisblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps afterhim.--Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.    A STREET CORTEGEBoth smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in MrBlooms wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, atail of white bowknots.--Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, andyoull kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.Small nines. Steal upon larks.He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on slidingfeet past the fireplace to J. J. OMolloy who placed the tissues in hisreceiving hands.--Whats that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other twogone?--Who? the professor said, turning. Theyre gone round to the Oval for adrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.--Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Wheres my hat?He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air andagainst the wood as he locked his desk drawer.--Hes pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.--Seems to be, J. J. OMolloy said, taking out a cigarettecase inmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the mostmatches?    THE CALUMET OF PEACEHe offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehanpromptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.OMolloy opened his case again and offered it.--THANKY VOUS, Lenehan said, helping himself.The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:  --TWAS RANK AND FAME THAT TEMPTED THEE,    TWAS EMPIRE CHARMED THY HEART.The professor grinned, locking his long lips.--Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for himwith quick grace, said:--Silence for my brandnew riddle!--IMPERIUM ROMANUM, J. J. OMolloy said gently. It sounds nobler thanBritish or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.--Thats it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.We havent got the chance of a snowball in hell.    THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME--Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. Wemustnt be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,imperial, imperious, imperative.He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:--What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: IT IS MEET TO BEHERE. LET US BUILD AN ALTAR TO JEHOVAH. The Roman, like the Englishman whofollows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set hisfoot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazedabout him in his toga and he said: IT IS MEET TO BE HERE. LET US CONSTRUCTA WATERCLOSET.--Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,as we read in the first chapter of Guinnesss, were partial to the runningstream.--They were natures gentlemen, J. J. OMolloy murmured. But we havealso Roman law.--And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.--Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. OMolloy asked.It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was goingswimmingly ...--First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?Mr OMadden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came infrom the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.--ENTREZ, MES ENFANTS! Lenehan cried.--I escort a suppliant, Mr OMadden Burke said melodiously. Youth led byExperience visits Notoriety.--How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Yourgovernor is just gone.    ? ? ?Lenehan said to all:--Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,excogitate, reply.Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.--Who? the editor asked.Bit torn off.--Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.--That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?    ON SWIFT SAIL FLAMING    FROM STORM AND SOUTH    HE COMES, PALE VAMPIRE,    MOUTH TO MY MOUTH.--Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over theirshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned ...?Bullockbefriending bard.    SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT--Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. MrGarrett Deasy asked me to ...--O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. Thebloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouthdisease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiters facein the Star and Garter. Oho!A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife ofMenelaus, ten years the Greeks. ORourke, prince of Breffni.--Is he a widower? Stephen asked.--Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down thetypescript. Emperors horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on theramparts of Vienna. Dont you forget! Maximilian Karl ODonnell, grafvon Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrianfieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes,every time. Dont you forget that!--The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. OMolloy said quietly,turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.Professor MacHugh turned on him.--And if not? he said.--Ill tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was oneday ...    LOST CAUSES    NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED--We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for usis the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyalto the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. Ispeak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: timeis money. Material domination. DOMINUS! Lord! Where is the spirituality?Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!    KYRIE ELEISON!A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his longlips.--The Greek! he said again. KYRIOS! Shining word! The vowels the Semiteand the Saxon know not. KYRIE! The radiance of the intellect. I ought toprofess Greek, the language of the mind. KYRIE ELEISON! The closetmakerand the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liegesubjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgarand of the empire of the spirit, not an IMPERIUM, that went under with theAthenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misledby an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.Loyal to a lost cause.He strode away from them towards the window.--They went forth to battle, Mr OMadden Burke said greyly, but theyalways fell.--Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received inthe latter half of the matinee. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!He whispered then near Stephens ear:    LENEHANS LIMERICK  --THERES A PONDEROUS PUNDIT MACHUGH    WHO WEARS GOGGLES OF EBONY HUE.    AS HE MOSTLY SEES DOUBLE    TO WEAR THEM WHY TROUBLE?    I CANT SEE THE JOE MILLER. CAN YOU?In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.--Thatll be all right, he said. Ill read the rest after. Thatll be allright.Lenehan extended his hands in protest.--But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?--Opera? Mr OMadden Burkes sphinx face reriddled.Lenehan announced gladly:--THE ROSE OF CASTILE. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!He poked Mr OMadden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr OMadden Burkefell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.--Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustlingtissues.The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand acrossStephens and Mr OMadden Burkes loose ties.--Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.--Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. OMolloy said in quietmockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.    OMNIUM GATHERUM--We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.--All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics ...--The turf, Lenehan put in.--Literature, the press.--If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.--And Madam Bloom, Mr OMadden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublinsprime favourite. Lenehan gave a loud cough.--Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught acold in the park. The gate was open.    YOU CAN DO IT!The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephens shoulder.--I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite init. You can do it. I see it in your face. IN THE LEXICON OF YOUTH ...See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.--Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Greatnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public!Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul.Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes MCarthy.--We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr OMadden Burke said.Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.--He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. OMolloy said.    THE GREAT GALLAHER--You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.Wait a minute. Well paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say whenhe was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher,that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made hismark? Ill tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder inthe Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. Ill show you.He pushed past them to the files.--Look at here, he said turning. The NEW YORK WORLD cabled for a special.Remember that time?Professor MacHugh nodded.--NEW YORK WORLD, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and therest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?--Skin-the-Goat, Mr OMadden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has thatcabmans shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.You know Holohan?--Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.--And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones forthe corporation. A night watchman.Stephen turned in surprise.--Gumley? he said. You dont say so? A friend of my fathers, is it?--Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mindthe stones, see they dont run away. Look at here. What did IgnatiusGallaher do? Ill tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Haveyou WEEKLY FREEMAN of  March? Right. Have you got that?He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.--Take page four, advertisement for Bransomes coffee, let us say. Haveyou got that? Right.The telephone whirred.    A DISTANT VOICE--Ill answer it, the professor said, going.--B is parkgate. Good.His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.--T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroongate.The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cocks wattles. An illstarcheddicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into hiswaistcoat.--Hello? EVENING TELEGRAPH here ... Hello?... Whos there? ...Yes ... Yes ... Yes.--F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore,Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P. Got that?X is Davys publichouse in upper Leeson street.The professor came to the inner door.--Bloom is at the telephone, he said.--Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davys publichouse,see?    CLEVER, VERY--Clever, Lenehan said. Very.--Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloodyhistory.Nightmare from which you will never awake.--I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, thebesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, andmyself.Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:--Madam, Im Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.--History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Princes street wasthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of anadvertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the legup. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star.Now hes got in with Blumenfeld. Thats press. Thats talent. Pyatt! Hewas all their daddies!--The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and thebrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.--Hello? ... Are you there? ... Yes, hes here still. Come acrossyourself.--Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.He flung the pages down.--Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr OMadden Burke.--Very smart, Mr OMadden Burke said.Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.--Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkerswere up before the recorder--O yes, J. J. OMolloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking homethrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclonelast year and thought shed buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to bea commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!--Theyre only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like thosefellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued OHagan. Eh?Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why didyou write it then?    RHYMES AND REASONSMouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth?Must be some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressedthe same, looking the same, two by two.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .LA TUA PACE    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .CHE PARLAR TI PIACE    . . . . .MENTREM CHE IL VENTO, COME FA, SI TACE.He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, inrusset, entwining, PER LAER PERSO, in mauve, in purple, QUELLA PACIFICAORIAFIAMMA, gold of oriflamme, DI RIMIRAR FE PIU ARDENTI. But I old men,penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.--Speak up for yourself, Mr OMadden Burke said.    SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY ...J. J. OMolloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.--My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a falseconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for thethird profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away withyou. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes andEdmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Boweryguttersheet not to mention PADDY KELLYS BUDGET, PUES OCCURRENCES and ourwatchful friend THE SKIBBEREEN EAGLE. Why bring in a master of forensiceloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.    LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE--Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in hisface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established . Dr Lucas.Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!--Well, J. J. OMolloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.--Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it inhis blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.--He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, onlyfor ... But no matter.J. J. OMolloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:--One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my lifefell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.    AND IN THE PORCHES OF MINE EAR DID POUR.By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or theother story, beast with two backs?--What was that? the professor asked.    ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM--He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. OMolloy said, of Roman justiceas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the LEX TALIONIS. And he citedthe Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.--Ha.--A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!Pause. J. J. OMolloy took out his cigarettecase.False lull. Something quite ordinary.Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time thatit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.    A POLISHED PERIODJ. J. OMolloy resumed, moulding his words:--He said of it: THAT STONY EFFIGY IN FROZEN MUSIC, HORNED AND TERRIBLE,OF THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE, THAT ETERNAL SYMBOL OF WISDOM AND OF PROPHECYWHICH, IF AUGHT THAT THE IMAGINATION OR THE HAND OF SCULPTOR HAS WROUGHTIN MARBLE OF SOULTRANSFIGURED AND OF SOULTRANSFIGURING DESERVES TO LIVE,DESERVES TO LIVE.His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.--Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.--The divine afflatus, Mr OMadden Burke said.--You like it? J. J. OMolloy asked Stephen.Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.He took a cigarette from the case. J. J. OMolloy offered his case toMyles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took histrophy, saying:--Muchibus thankibus.    A MAN OF HIGH MORALE--Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. OMolloy said toStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hushpoets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was anice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewerthat you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him aboutplanes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pullingA. E.s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did hesay about me? Dont ask.--No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I everheard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historicalsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, hadspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:--You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of hisdiscourse.--He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. OMolloy said, rumour has it, onthe Trinity college estates commission.--He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a childsfrock. Go on. Well?--It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will notsay the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon thenew movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, thereforeworthless.He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised anoutspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb andringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.    IMPROMPTUIn ferial tone he addressed J. J. OMolloy:--Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he hadprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even oneshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggybeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether helooked (though he was not) a dying man.His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. OMolloys towardsStephens face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazedlinen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.Still seeking, he said:--When Fitzgibbons speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.He began:--MR CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: GREAT WAS MY ADMIRATION IN LISTENINGTO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTH OF IRELAND A MOMENT SINCE BY MYLEARNED FRIEND. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO A COUNTRYFAR AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY, INTO AN AGE REMOTE FROM THIS AGE, THAT I STOODIN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE SPEECH OF SOME HIGHPRIESTOF THAT LAND ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTHFUL MOSES.His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokesascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let ourcrooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand atit yourself?--AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD THE VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN HIGHPRIESTRAISED IN A TONE OF LIKE HAUGHTINESS AND LIKE PRIDE. I HEARD HIS WORDS ANDTHEIR MEANING WAS REVEALED TO ME.    FROM THE FATHERSIt was revealed to me that those things are good which yet arecorrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they weregood could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! Thats saint Augustine.--WHY WILL YOU JEWS NOT ACCEPT OUR CULTURE, OUR RELIGION AND OURLANGUAGE? YOU ARE A TRIBE OF NOMAD HERDSMEN: WE ARE A MIGHTY PEOPLE. YOUHAVE NO CITIES NOR NO WEALTH: OUR CITIES ARE HIVES OF HUMANITY AND OURGALLEYS, TRIREME AND  QUADRIREME, LADEN WITH ALL MANNER MERCHANDISE FURROWTHE WATERS OF THE KNOWN GLOBE. YOU HAVE BUT EMERGED FROM PRIMITIVECONDITIONS: WE HAVE A LITERATURE, A PRIESTHOOD, AN AGELONG HISTORY AND APOLITY.Nile.Child, man, effigy.By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a mansupple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.--YOU PRAY TO A LOCAL AND OBSCURE IDOL: OUR TEMPLES, MAJESTIC ANDMYSTERIOUS, ARE THE ABODES OF ISIS AND OSIRIS, OF HORUS AND AMMON RA.YOURS SERFDOM, AWE AND HUMBLENESS: OURS THUNDER AND THE SEAS. ISRAEL ISWEAK AND FEW ARE HER CHILDREN: EGYPT IS AN HOST AND TERRIBLE ARE HER ARMS. VAGRANTS AND DAYLABOURERS ARE YOU CALLED: THE WORLD TREMBLES AT OUR NAME.A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above itboldly:--BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAD THE YOUTHFUL MOSES LISTENED TO ANDACCEPTED THAT VIEW OF LIFE, HAD HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND BOWED HIS WILL ANDBOWED HIS SPIRIT BEFORE THAT ARROGANT ADMONITION HE WOULD NEVER HAVEBROUGHT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE OF BONDAGE, NOR FOLLOWED THEPILLAR OF THE CLOUD BY DAY. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ETERNALAMID LIGHTNINGS ON SINAIS MOUNTAINTOP NOR EVER HAVE COME DOWN WITH THELIGHT OF INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN HIS ARMSTHE TABLES OF THE LAW, GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OUTLAW.He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.    OMINOUS--FOR HIM!J. J. OMolloy said not without regret:--And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.--A sudden--at--the--moment--though--from--lingering--illness--often--previously--expectorated--demise, Lenehan added. And with agreat future behind him.The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway andpattering up the staircase.--That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the wind.Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches.The tribunes words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A peoplesheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all that everanywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.I have money.--Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may Isuggest that the house do now adjourn?--You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? MrOMadden Burke asked. Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.--That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favoursay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To whichparticular boosing shed? ... My casting vote is: Mooneys!He led the way, admonishing:--We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,we will not. By no manner of means.Mr OMadden Burke, following close, said with an allys lunge of hisumbrella:--Lay on, Macduff!--Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on theshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.--Foot and mouth. I know. Thatll be all right. Thatll go in. Where arethey? Thats all right.He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.    LET US HOPEJ. J. OMolloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:--I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.--Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isnt it? It hasthe prophetic vision. FUIT ILIUM! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of thisworld. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels andrushed out into the street, yelling:--Racing special!Dublin. I have much, much to learn.They turned to the left along Abbey street.--I have a vision too, Stephen said.--Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford willfollow.Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:--Racing special!    DEAR DIRTY DUBLINDubliners.--Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fiftyand fiftythree years in Fumballys lane.--Where is that? the professor asked.--Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Faceglistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.Quicker, darlint!On now. Dare it. Let there be life.--They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelsons pillar.They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. Theyshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies withthe blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven incoppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take theirumbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.--Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.    LIFE ON THE RAW--They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf atthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,proprietress ... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl atthe foot of Nelsons pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They givetwo threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddleslowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraidof the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praisingGod and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at theairslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearnshas the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a ladywho got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes acrubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.--Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can seethem. Whats keeping our friend?He turned.A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering inall directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after themMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face,talking with J. J. OMolloy.--Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.He set off again to walk by Stephens side.    RETURN OF BLOOM--Yes, he said. I see them.Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near theoffices of the IRISH CATHOLIC AND DUBLIN PENNY JOURNAL, called:--Mr Crawford! A moment!--TELEGRAPH! Racing special!--What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.A newsboy cried in Mr Blooms face:--Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!    INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR--Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyesjust now. Hell give a renewal for two months, he says. After hell see.But he wants a par to call attention in the TELEGRAPH too, the Saturdaypink. And he wants it copied if its not too late I told councillorNannetti from the KILKENNY PEOPLE. I can have access to it in the nationallibrary. House of keys, dont you see? His name is Keyes. Its a play onthe name. But he practically promised hed give the renewal. But he wantsjust a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?    K.M.A.--Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing outhis arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.Lenehans yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder isthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on himtoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in mucksomewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?--Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design Isuppose its worth a short par. Hed give the ad, I think. Ill tellhim ...    K.M.R.I.A.--He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over hisshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strodeon jerkily.    RAISING THE WIND--NULLA BONA, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. Im up tohere. Ive been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow toback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take thewill for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the windanyhow.J. J. OMolloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caughtup on the others and walked abreast.--When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twentyfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to therailings.--Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two oldDublin women on the top of Nelsons pillar.    SOME COLUMN!--    THATS WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID--Thats new, Myles Crawford said. Thats copy. Out for the waxiesDargle. Two old trickies, what?--But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see theroofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines bluedome, Adam and Eves, saint Laurence OTooles. But it makes them giddy tolook so they pull up their skirts ...    THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES--Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. Were in thearchdiocese here.--And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statueof the onehandled adulterer.--Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea.I see what you mean.    DAMES DONATE DUBLINS CITS SPEEDPILLS    VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF--It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are tootired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums betweenthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with theirhandkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spittingthe plumstones slowly out between the railings.He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr OMaddenBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooneys.--Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.    SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON    PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. ITHACANS    VOW PEN IS CHAMP.--You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple ofGorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he werebitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble anda bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beautyfrom Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.They made ready to cross OConnell street.    HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionlesstrolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham,Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend andSandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, deliverywaggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats withrattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.    WHAT?--AND LIKEWISE--WHERE?--But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get theplums?    VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.    SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.--Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide toreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT.--No, Stephen said. I call it A PISGAH SIGHT OF PALESTINE OR THE PARABLEOF THE PLUMS.--I see, the professor said.He laughed richly.--I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. Wegave him that idea, he added to J. J. OMolloy.    HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAYJ. J. OMolloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue andheld his peace.--I see, the professor said.He halted on sir John Grays pavement island and peered aloft at Nelsonthrough the meshes of his wry smile.    DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING    FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLO    WANGLES--YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?--Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I mustsay.--Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almightystruth was known.    * * * * * * *Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch.

Manna. Live on fish, fishy fleshthey have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swimdown here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes.Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.They wheeled flapping weakly. Im not going to throw any more.Penny quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread footand mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tasteslike that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish arenot salty? How is that?His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchoron the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.KINOS/-TROUSERSGood idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How canyou own water really? Its always flowing in a stream, never the same,which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream.

Only big words for ordinary things on account of thesound. Shes not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I wasthinking. Still, I dont know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a basebarreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and youd think he was singinginto a barrel. Now, isnt that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Nothalf as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross.Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away numberone Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out. A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towardshim along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains.

I suggestedto him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sittinginside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet thatwould have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.Everyone dying to know what shes writing. Get twenty of them round youif you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity.Pillar of salt. Wouldnt have it of course because he didnt thinkof it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stainof black celluloid.

But glad to communicate with the outside world.Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet nametoo: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she hadmarried she would have changed. I suppose they really were short ofmoney. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them.My hearts broke eating dripping.

She didnt like it because I sprained my ankle first day she worechoir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwins tall hat done upwith some sticky stuff. Flies picnic too.

He and I behind. Sheet of her music blewout of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didnt. Thinglike that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linkingher in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts.Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be fornever. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Cornerof Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts andher boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind.Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those piecesof lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And themulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping thebusk of her stays: white.Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm fromher. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near twotaking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.That was the night ...--O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?--O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?--No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Havent seen her for ages.--In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down inMullingar, you know.--Go away! Isnt that grand for her?--Yes. In a photographers there. Getting on like a house on fire. How areall your charges?--All on the bakers list, Mrs Breen said.How many has she? No other in sight.--Youre in black, I see. You have no ...--No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Whos dead, when and what didhe die of? Turn up like a bad penny.--O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasnt any near relation.May as well get her sympathy.--Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.    YOUR FUNERALS TOMORROW    WHILE YOURE COMING THROUGH THE RYE.

Just: quietly: husband.--And your lord and master?Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasnt lost them anyhow.--O, dont be talking! she said. Hes a caution to rattlesnakes. Hes inthere now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has meheartscalded. Wait till I show you.Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypolypoured out from Harrisons. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of MrBlooms gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerarasugar, or theyd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefootarab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw ofhunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner.

Dream he had, a nightmare.Indiges.--Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.--The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.She took a folded postcard from her handbag.--Read that, she said. He got it this morning.--What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?--U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. Its a great shamefor them whoever he is.--Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.She took back the card, sighing.--And now hes going round to Mr Mentons office. Hes going to take anaction for ten thousand pounds, he says.She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seenits best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three oldgrapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tastydresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. Im hungry too.

Three days! Thats terriblefor her.Mrs Breen nodded.--She was taken bad on the Tuesday ...Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:--Mind! Let this man pass.A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with arapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as askullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, astick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.--Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!--Who is he if its a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?--His name is Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, MrBloom said smiling. Watch!--He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of thesedays.She broke off suddenly.--There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me toMolly, wont you?--I will, Mr Bloom said.He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. DenisBreen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrisonshugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like oldtimes. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust hisdull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.Meshuggah. Off his chump.Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight thetight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days.Watch him!  Out he goes again.

Isnt he in the insurance line?--Hes out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for theFREEMAN.--I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?--Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?--I noticed he was in mourning.--Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all athome. Youre right, by God. So he was.--I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see agentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.--Its not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.

I often saw him in here and Inever once saw him--you know, over the line.--God Almighty couldnt make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slipsoff when the fun gets too hot. Didnt you see him look at his watch? Ah,you werent there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outswith the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.--There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. Hes a safe man, Id say.--Hes not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.

Why we left the church of Rome.A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.No tram in sight. Wants to cross.--Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. Hemoved his head uncertainly.--Youre in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.Do you want to cross? Theres nothing in the way.The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Blooms eye followed itsline and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before Dragos. Where Isaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in JohnLongs. Slaking his drouth.--Theres a van there, Mr Bloom said, but its not moving. Ill see youacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?--Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.--Come, Mr Bloom said.He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand toguide it forward.Say something to him. Better not do the condescending.

Thats right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.--Thanks, sir.Knows Im a man. Voice.--Right now? First turn to the left.The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawinghis cane back, feeling again.Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbonetweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense ofvolume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonderwould he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea ofDublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walkin a beeline if he hadnt that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellowgoing in to be a priest.Penrose! That was that chaps name.Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.Tune pianos.

Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girlpassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them allon. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his minds eye. Thevoice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost seethe lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black,for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin.Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order twoshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationers just here too.Wait. Think over it.With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back abovehis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt theskin of his right cheek.

The walk. Not see. Get on.Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?Didnt see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Coldstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.No. Didnt see me. After two. Just at the gate.My heart!His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. SirThomas Deane was the Greek architecture.Look for something I.His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfoldedAgendath Netaim.

Gate.Safe!    * * * * * * *Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:--And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of WILHELM MEISTER. Agreat poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against asea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and astep backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him anoiseless beck.--Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautifulineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feelsthat Goethes judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by thedoor he gave his large ear all to the attendants words: heard them: and wasgone.Two left.--Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes beforehis death.--Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked withelders gall, to write PARADISE LOST at your dictation? THE SORROWSOF SATAN he calls it.Smile. Smile Cranlys smile.    FIRST HE TICKLED HER    THEN HE PATTED HER    THEN HE PASSED THE FEMALE CATHETER.

He laughedlow: a sizars laugh of Trinity: unanswered.    ORCHESTRAL SATAN, WEEPING MANY A ROOD    TEARS SUCH AS ANGELS WEEP.

And onemore to hail him: AVE, RABBI: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glenhe cooees for them. My souls youth I gave him, night by night. God speed.Good hunting.Mulligan has my telegram.Folly. Persist.--Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create afigure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeares Hamlet thoughI admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.--All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of hisshadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.Clergymens discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to usideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of artis out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau isthe painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamletbring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Platos world ofideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!--The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.Aristotle was once Platos schoolboy.--And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. Onecan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, theheavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos whosuffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon thealtar. I am the sacrificial butter.Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the NameIneffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is nosecret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching tosee if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light,born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane ofbuddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work offbad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrioussister H.P.B.s elemental.O, fie! Out ont! PFUITEUFEL! You naughtnt to look, missus, so younaughtnt when a ladys ashowing of her elemental.Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand withgrace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.--That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlets musings aboutthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant andundramatic monologue, as shallow as Platos.John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:--Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotlewith Plato.--Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from hiscommonwealth?Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness ofallhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in thestreet: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Throughspaces smaller than red globules of mans blood they creepycrawl afterBlakes buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.--Haines is gone, he said.--Is he?--I was showing him Jubainvilles book. Hes quite enthusiastic, dont youknow, about Hydes LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT. I couldnt bring him in tohear the discussion. Hes gone to Gills to buy it.    BOUND THEE FORTH, MY BOOKLET, QUICK    TO GREET THE CALLOUS PUBLIC.    WRIT, I WEEN, TWAS NOT MY WISH    IN LEAN UNLOVELY ENGLISH.--The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Greentwinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.--People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg ofRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in theworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasants heart on thehillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the livingmother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce thesixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flowerof corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to thepoor of heart, the life of Homers Phaeacians.From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.--Mallarme, dont you know, he said, has written those wonderful prosepoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one aboutHAMLET. He says: IL SE PROMENE, LISANT AU LIVRE DE LUI-MEME, dont youknow, READING THE BOOK OF HIMSELF. He describes HAMLET given in a Frenchtown, dont you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.    HAMLET    OU    LE DISTRAIT    PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE He repeated to John Eglintons newgathered frown:--PIECE DE SHAKESPEARE, dont you know. Its so French. The French pointof view. HAMLET OU ...--The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended. John Eglinton laughed.--Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, butdistressingly shortsighted in some matters. Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.--A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not fornothing was he a butchers son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spittingin his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his fathers one. Our Fatherwho art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets dont hesitate to shoot. Thebloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration campsung by Mr Swinburne.Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.    WHELPS AND DAMS OF MURDEROUS FOES WHOM NONE    BUT WE HAD SPARED ...Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.--He will have it that HAMLET is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for MrBests behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our fleshcreep.    LIST! LIST! O LIST!My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.    IF THOU DIDST EVER ...--What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has fadedinto impalpability through death, through absence, through change ofmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Parislies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from LIMBO PATRUM, returning tothe world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.Lifted.--It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swiftglance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. Thebear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers whosailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.--Shakespeare has left the huguenots house in Silver street and walks bythe swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the penchivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon hasother thoughts.Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!--The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in thecastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is theghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who hasstudied HAMLET all the years of his life which were not vanity in order toplay the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young playerwho stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:    HAMLET, I AM THY FATHERS SPIRIT,bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, youngHamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died inStratford that his namesake may live for ever.Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in thevesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words tohis own sons name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have beenprince Hamlets twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that hedid not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you arethe dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is theguilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?--But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell beganimpatiently.Art thou there, truepenny?--Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I meanwhen we read the poetry of KING LEAR what is it to us how the poet lived?As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de lIsle has said.Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poets drinking,the poets debts. We have KING LEAR: and it is immortal.Mr Bests face, appealed to, agreed.    FLOW OVER THEM WITH YOUR WAVES AND WITH YOUR WATERS, MANANAAN,    MANANAAN MACLIR ...How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?Marry, I wanted it.Take thou this noble.Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnsons bed, clergymansdaughter. Agenbite of inwit.Do you intend to pay it back?O, yes.When? Now?Well ... No.When, then?I paid my way. I paid my way.Steady on.

I.A.E.I.O.U.--Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? JohnEglintons carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.She died, for literature at least, before she was born.--She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She sawhim into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore hischildren and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when helay on his deathbed.Mothers deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought meinto this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. LILIATARUTILANTIUM.I wept alone.John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.--The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got outof it as quickly and as best he could.--Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. Hiserrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.--A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery,one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn fromXanthippe?--Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughtsinto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (ABSIT NOMEN!),Socratididions Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. Butneither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from thearchons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.--But Ann Hathaway? Mr Bests quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seemto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.His look went from brooders beard to carpers skull, to remind, tochide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltlessthough maligned.--He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling THEGIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME. If the earthquake did not time it we should knowwhere to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studdedbridle and her blue windows. That memory, VENUS AND ADONIS, lay in thebedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrewillfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think thewriter of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in theback of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to liewithal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomenare the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their willAnn hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him,sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis,stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfacedStratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.And my turn? When?Come!--Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,brightly.He murmured then with blond delight for all:    BETWEEN THE ACRES OF THE RYE    THESE PRETTY COUNTRYFOLK WOULD LIE.Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled itscooperative watch.--I am afraid I am due at the HOMESTEAD.Whither away? Exploitable ground.--Are you going? John Eglintons active eyebrows asked. Shall we see youat Moores tonight? Piper is coming.--Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.--I dont know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get awayin time.Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.

IN QUINTESSENTIAL TRIVIALITY    FOR YEARS IN THIS FLESHCASE A SHESOUL DWELT.--They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together asheaf of our younger poets verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,lighted, shone.See this. Remember.Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on hisashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly withtwo index fingers. Aristotles experiment. One or two? Necessity is that invirtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat isone hat.Listen.Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.Longworth will give it a good puff in the EXPRESS. O, will he? I likedColums DROVER. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you thinkhe has genius really? Yeats admired his line: AS IN WILD EARTH A GRECIANVASE. Did he? I hope youll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan iscoming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear MissMitchells joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyns wildoats? Awfully clever, isnt it? They remind one of Don Quixote and SanchoPanza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore isthe man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With asaffron kilt? ONeill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We arebecoming important, it seems.Cordelia. CORDOGLIO. Lirs loneliest daughter.Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.--Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be sokind as to give the letter to Mr Norman ...--O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so muchcorrespondence.--I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.God ild you. The pigs paper. Bullockbefriending.Synge has promised me an article for DANA too. Are we going to beread? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope youwill come round tonight. Bring Starkey.Stephen sat down.The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his masksaid:--Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of achopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:--Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inwardlight?--Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first asundering.--Yes.Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Womenhe won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bullytapsters wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured bodythat once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leavesfalling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.--Yes. So you think ...The door closed behind the outgoer.Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm andbrooding air.A vestals lamp.Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have livedto do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities ofthe possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore whenhe lived among women.Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice ofwords. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard thevoice of that Egyptian highpriest. IN PAINTED CHAMBERS LOADED WITHTILEBOOKS.They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch ofdeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak theirwill.--Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Othersabide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.--But HAMLET is so personal, isnt it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind ofprivate paper, dont you know, of his private life. I mean, I dont care abutton, dont you know, who is killed or who is guilty ...He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling hisdefiance. His private papers in the original. TA AN BAD AR AN TIR. TAIM IN MOSHAGART. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:--I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but Imay as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeareis Hamlet you have a stern task before you.Bear with me.Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern underwrinkled brows. A basilisk. E QUANDO VEDE LUOMO LATTOSCA. MesserBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.--As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artistweave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is whereit was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stufftime after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of theunliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when themind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am andthat which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister ofthe past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that whichthen I shall be.Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.--Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitternessmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from theson.Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.--That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.--If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug inthe market. The plays of Shakespeares later years which Renan admired somuch breathe another spirit.--The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.--There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been asundering.Said that.--If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over thehell of time of KING LEAR, OTHELLO, HAMLET, TROILUS AND CRESSIDA, look tosee when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man,shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince ofTyre?Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.--A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.--The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constantquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead tothe town.Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacons wild oats.Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. Whattown, good masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.East of the sun, west of the moon: TIR NA N-OG. Booted the twain andstaved.    HOW MANY MILES TO DUBLIN?    THREE SCORE AND TEN, SIR.    WILL WE BE THERE BY CANDLELIGHT?--Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closingperiod.--Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some averhis name is, say of it?--Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, thatwhich was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughters child.MY DEAREST WIFE, Pericles says, WAS LIKE THIS MAID. Will any man love thedaughter if he has not loved the mother?--The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. LART DETREGRAND ...--Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,another image?Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known toall men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quaeconcupiscimus ...--His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard ofall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. Theimages of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in themgrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.--I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of thepublic. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr GeorgeBernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles onShakespeare in the SATURDAY REVIEW were surely brilliant. Oddly enoughhe too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if thepoet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmonywith--what shall I say?--our notions of what ought not to have been.Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auks egg,prize of their fray.He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam?Dost love thy man?--That may be too, Stephen said. Theres a saying of Goethes which MrMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because youwill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a BUONAROBA, abay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, alordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had madehimself a coistrel gentleman and he had written ROMEO AND JULIET. Why?Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in acornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victorin his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and liedown. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undothe first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where lovelies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womansinvisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the fleshdriving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkeningeven his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the tworages commingle in a whirlpool.They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.--The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porchof a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot knowthe manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with thatknowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backsthat urged it King Hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowedwith knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovelyEnglish) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished,what he would but would not, go with him from Lucreces bluecircled ivoryglobes to Imogens breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goesback, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, anold dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes ontowards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom hehas written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is aghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinores rocks or what you will, theseas voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substanceof his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.--Amen! was responded from the doorway.Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?ENTRACTE.A ribald face, sullen as a deans, Buck Mulligan came forward, thenblithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.--You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he askedof Stephen.Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.They make him welcome. WAS DU VERLACHST WIRST DU NOCH DIENEN.Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sentHimself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by Hisfiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved oncrosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heavenand there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of HisOwn Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and deadwhen all the quick shall be dead already.Glo--o--ri--a in ex--cel--sis De--o.He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bellsaquiring.--Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.Mr Mulligan, Ill be bound, has his theory too of the play and ofShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.He smiled on all sides equally.Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:--Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.--To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes likeSynge.Mr Best turned to him.--Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? Hell see you after at theD. B. C. Hes gone to Gills to buy Hydes LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT.--I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?--The bards fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tiredperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress playedHamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Viningheld that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be anIrishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears(His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.--The most brilliant of all is that story of Wildes, Mr Best said,lifting his brilliant notebook. THAT PORTRAIT OF MR W. H. where he provesthat the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.--For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?--I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Ofcourse its all paradox, dont you know, Hughes and hews and hues, thecolour, but its so typical the way he works it out. Its the very essenceof Wilde, dont you know. The light touch.His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.Tame essence of Wilde.Youre darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasysducats.How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.Wit.

Yea, turtledove her.Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang ins kiss.--Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. Themocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.They talked seriously of mockers seriousness.Buck Mulligans again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, hishead wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. Hismobile lips read, smiling with new delight.--Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:--THE SENTIMENTALIST IS HE WHO WOULD ENJOY WITHOUT INCURRING THE IMMENSEDEBTORSHIP FOR A THING DONE. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch itfrom? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? Theaunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! MalachiMulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, youpriestified Kinchite!Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in aquerulous brogue:--Its what Im telling you, mister honey, its queer and sick we were,Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. Twas murmur we did fora gallus potion would rouse a friar, Im thinking, and he limp withleching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Conneryssitting civil waiting for pints apiece.He wailed:--And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending usyour conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long likethe drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.Stephen laughed.Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.--The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heardyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. Hes out in pampooties to murderyou.--Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdroppingceiling.--Murder you! he laughed.Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash oflights in rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras.Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing awinebottle. CEST VENDREDI SAINT! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering,he met. I mine. I met a fool ithe forest.--Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.-- ... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in hisDIARY OF MASTER WILLIAM SILENCE has found the hunting terms ... Yes? Whatis it?--Theres a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward andoffering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of theKILKENNY PEOPLE for last year.--Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman? ...He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced,looked, asked, creaked, asked:--Is he? ... O, there!Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talkedwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, mosthonest broadbrim.--This gentleman? FREEMANS JOURNAL? KILKENNY PEOPLE? To be sure. Goodday, sir. KILKENNY ... We have certainly ...A patient silhouette waited, listening.--All the leading provincial ... NORTHERN WHIG, CORK EXAMINER,ENNISCORTHY GUARDIAN,  ... Will you please? ... Evans,conduct this gentleman ... If you just follow the atten ... Or, pleaseallow me ... This way ... Please, sir ...Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowingdark figure following his hasty heels.The door closed.--The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.He jumped up and snatched the card.--Whats his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.He rattled on:--Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in themuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouththat has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.LIFE OF LIFE, THY LIPS ENKINDLE.Suddenly he turned to Stephen:--He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greekerthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! THE GOD PURSUING THEMAIDEN HID.--We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Bests approval.We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if atall, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.--Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beautyfrom Kyrios Menelaus brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy inwhom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty yearshe lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equalto that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art,more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art ofsurfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses,marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, whenthey arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pairof fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to viewith her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial loveand its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.You know Manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade Dick Burbageto her bed after she had seen him in RICHARD III and how Shakespeare,overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the hornsand, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the caponsblankets: WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CAME BEFORE RICHARD III. And the gaylakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, ladyPenelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punksof the bankside, a penny a time.Cours la Reine. ENCORE VINGT SOUS. NOUS FERONS DE PETITES COCHONNERIES.MINETTE? TU VEUX?--The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxfords motherwith her cup of canary for any cockcanary.Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:--Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!--And Harry of six wives daughter. And other lady friends fromneighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all thosetwenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doingbehind the diamond panes?Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard,herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lidsof Junos eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglintons desk sharply.--Whom do you suspect? he challenged.--Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twicespurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.Love that dare not speak its name.--As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loveda lord.Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.--It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for allother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for thestallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had ashrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Twodeeds are rank in that ghosts mind: a broken vow and the dullbrainedyokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husbands brother. SweetAnn, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.Stephen turned boldly in his chair.--The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If youdeny that in the fifth scene of HAMLET he has branded her with infamy tellme why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between theday she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw theirmen down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dearWillun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go,Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, herhusband too, while Susans daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddyswords, wed her second, having killed her first.O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royalLondon to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathersshepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he hascommended her to posterity.He faced their silence.To whom thus Eglinton:        You mean the will.    But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.    She was entitled to her widows dower    At common law. His legal knowledge was great    Our judges tell us.        Him Satan fleers,    Mocker:        And therefore he left out her name    From the first draft but he did not leave out    The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,    For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford    And in London. And therefore when he was urged,    As I believe, to name her    He left her his    Secondbest    Bed.                PUNKT.    Leftherhis    Secondbest    Leftherhis    Bestabed    Secabest    Leftabed.Woa!--Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, asthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.--He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms andlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalistshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her hisbest bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?--It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest,Mr Secondbest Best said finely.--SEPARATIO A MENSA ET A THALAMO, bettered Buck Mulligan and wassmiled on.--Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.Let me think.--Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, paystribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of hisdead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (dont forgetNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.--Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean ...--He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for aking. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!--What? asked Besteglinton.William Shakespeare and company, limited. The peoples William.For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house ...--Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thoughtof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his handsand said: ALL WE CAN SAY IS THAT LIFE RAN VERY HIGH IN THOSE DAYS. Lovely!Catamite.--The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best tougling Eglinton.Steadfast John replied severe:--The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cakeand have it.Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?--And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his ownlong pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself acornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famineriots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned byChettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued afellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound offlesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubreys ostler andcallboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylockchimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of thequeens leech Lopez, his jews heart being plucked forth while the sheenywas yet alive: HAMLET AND MACBETH with the coming to the throne of aScotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada ishis jeer in LOVES LABOUR LOST. His pageants, the histories, sailfullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits aretried and we have a porters theory of equivocation. The SEA VENTURE comeshome from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with PatsyCaliban, our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidneys. As forfay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired THEMERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life longfor deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.I think youre getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture oftheolologicophilolological. MINGO, MINXI, MICTUM, MINGERE.--Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,expectantly. Your dean ofstudies holds he was a holy Roman.SUFFLAMINANDUS SUM.--He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion Frenchpolisher of Italian scandals.--A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.AMPLIUS. IN SOCIETATE HUMANA HOC EST MAXIME NECESSARIUM UT SIT AMICITIAINTER MULTOS.--Saint Thomas, Stephen began ...--Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.There he keened a wailing rune.--POGUE MAHONE! ACUSHLA MACHREE! Its destroyed we are from this day! Itsdestroyed we are surely!All smiled their smiles.--Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoyreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint differentfrom that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in hiswise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the loveso given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from somestranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians taxwith avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built upthe hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter)bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sinsor virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man whoholds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debtswill hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he callshis wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or hismanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.--Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.--Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.--Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.--The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Willswidow, is the will to die.--REQUIESCAT! Stephen prayed.    WHAT OF ALL THE WILL TO DO?    IT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO ...--She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobledqueen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as amotorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Placeand drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed heslept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had readto her his chapbooks preferring them to the MERRY WIVES and, loosing hernightly waters on the jordan, she thought over HOOKS AND EYES FORBELIEVERS BREECHES and THE MOST SPIRITUAL SNUFFBOX TO MAKE THE MOSTDEVOUT SOULS SNEEZE. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite ofinwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom gropingfor its god.--History shows that to be true, INQUIT EGLINTONUS CHRONOLOLOGOS. The agessucceed one another. But we have it on high authority that a mans worstenemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell isright. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that onlyfamily poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel thatthe fat knight is his supreme creation.Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, suppingwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade ithim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, theres a gentlemanto see you. Me? Says hes your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. EnterMagee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with abuttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests,a wand of wilding in his hand.Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside Itouched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny isattending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.--A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessaryevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death. Ifyou hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, withthirtyfive years of life, NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN DI NOSTRA VITA, with fiftyof experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then youmust hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. Thecorpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour itrots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised thatmystical estate upon his son. Boccaccios Calandrino was the first andlast man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense ofconscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, anapostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mysteryand not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flungto the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovablybecause founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Uponincertitude, upon unlikelihood. AMOR MATRIS, subjective and objectivegenitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legalfiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or heany son?What the hell are you driving at?I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.AMPLIUS. ADHUC. ITERUM. POSTEA.Are you condemned to do this?--They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminalannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbicsisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers,jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn marsbeauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is anew male: his growth is his fathers decline, his youth his fathers envy,his friend his fathers enemy.In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.--What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.Am I a father? If I were?Shrunken uncertain hand.--Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of thefield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin,with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the fatherwho has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be ason? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the samename in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his ownson merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father ofall his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborngrandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Mageeunderstands her, abhors perfection.Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladlyglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.--Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big withchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! Theplays the thing! Let me parturiate!He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.--As for his family, Stephen said, his mothers name lives in the forestof Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia inCORIOLANUS. His boysons death is the deathscene of young Arthur in KINGJOHN. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls inTHE TEMPEST, in PERICLES, in WINTERS TALE are we know. Who Cleopatra,fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there isanother member of his family who is recorded.--The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake,with haste, quake, quack.Door closed. Cell. Day.They list. Three. They.I you he they.Come, mess.STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in hisold age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gathererone time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter upin Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man ons back. The playhouse sausagefilled Gilberts soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard arerecorded in the works of sweet William.MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! Whats in a name?BEST: That is my name, Richard, dont you know. I hope you are going tosay a good word for Richard, dont you know, for my sake.

I dont want Richard,my name ...                (Laughter)QUAKERLYSTER: (A TEMPO) But he that filches from me my good name ...STEPHEN: (STRINGENDO) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William,in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy sethis face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnetswhere there is Will in overplus. Like John oGaunt his name is dear to him,as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear orsteeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory ofgreatest shakescene in the country. Whats in a name? That is what we askourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. Astar, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in theheavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shoneover delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is thesignature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying onthe horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summerfields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.Both satisfied. I too.Dont tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.And from her arms.Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?Read the skies. AUTONTIMORUMENOS. BOUS STEPHANOUMENOS. Wheresyour configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: SUA DONNA.GIA: DI LUI. GELINDO RISOLVE DI NON AMARE S. D.--What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestialphenomenon?--A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.What mores to speak?Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.STEPHANOS, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape ofmy feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.--You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own nameis strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.Me, Magee and Mulligan.Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.PATER, AIT. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:--Thats very interesting because that brother motive, dont you know, wefind also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothersShakespeare. In Grimm too, dont you know, the fairytales. The thirdbrother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.The quaker librarian springhalted near.--I should like to know, he said, which brother you ... I understand youto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers ... Butperhaps I am anticipating?He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.An attendant from the doorway called:--Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants ...--O, Father Dineen! Directly.Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.John Eglinton touched the foil.--Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard andEdmund. You kept them for the last, didnt you?--In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie andnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. Abrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.Lapwing.Where is your brother? Apothecaries hall. My whetstone. Him, thenCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. Theymock to try you. Act. Be acted on.Lapwing.I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.On.--You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which hetook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowedAnn (whats in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all hiskings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeares reverence,the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of KING LEAR in which Edmundfigures lifted out of Sidneys ARCADIA and spatchcocked on to a Celticlegend older than history?--That was Wills way, John Eglinton defended. We should not nowcombine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.QUE VOULEZ-VOUS? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast andmakes Ulysses quote Aristotle.--Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or theusurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare,what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment,banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedlyfrom THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA onward till Prospero breaks his staff,buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doublesitself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeatsitself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeatsitself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughterSusan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it wasthe original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened hiswill and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words arethose of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like originalsin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is betweenthe lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstoneunder which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite varietyeverywhere in the world he has created, in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, twicein AS YOU LIKE IT, in THE TEMPEST, in HAMLET, in MEASURE FOR MEASURE--andin all the other plays which I have not read.He laughed to free his mind from his minds bondage.Judge Eglinton summed up.--The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He isall in all.--He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.All in all. In CYMBELINE, in OTHELLO he is bawd and cuckold. He acts andis acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills thereal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselesslywilling that the moor in him shall suffer.--Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!Dark dome received, reverbed.--And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.When all is said Dumas FILS (or is it Dumas PERE?) is right. After GodShakespeare has created most.--Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns aftera life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he hasalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of lifeended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion isended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet PERE and Hamlet FILS. A king and aprince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murderedand betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner,sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to bedivorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero,the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpas lump of love, and nuncle Richie,the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggersgo. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in hisworld within as possible. Maeterlinck says: IF SOCRATES LEAVE HIS HOUSETODAY HE WILL FIND THE SAGE SEATED ON HIS DOORSTEP. IF JUDAS GO FORTHTONIGHT IT IS TO JUDAS HIS STEPS WILL TEND. Every life is many days,day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants,old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meetingourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote itbadly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord ofthings as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call DIO BOIA,hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher,and would be bawd and cuckold too but  that in the economy of heaven,foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, anandrogynous angel, being a wife unto himself.--EUREKA! Buck Mulligan cried. EUREKA!Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglintonsdesk.--May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.He began to scribble on a slip of paper.Take some slips from the counter going out.--Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shalllive. The rest shall keep as they are.He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each hisvariorum edition of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.--You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You havebrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe yourown theory?--No, Stephen said promptly.--Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it adialogue, dont you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.John Eclecticon doubly smiled.--Well, in that case, he said, I dont see why you should expect paymentfor it since you dont believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is somemystery in HAMLET but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper metin Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secretis hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the presentduke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays.It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or helpme to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? EGOMEN. Who to unbelieve? Otherchap.--You are the only contributor to DANA who asks for pieces of silver. ThenI dont know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an articleon economics.Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.--For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: andthen gravely said, honeying malice:--I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upperMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the SUMMA CONTRAGENTILES in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie,the coalquay whore.He broke away.--Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your ortsand offals.Stephen rose.Life is many days. This will end.--We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. NOTRE AMI Moore saysMalachi Mulligan must be there.Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.--Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth ofIreland. Ill be there.

Five tothree. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boys name again?Dignam. Yes. VERE DIGNUM ET IUSTUM EST. Brother Swan was the person tosee. Mr Cunninghams letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practicalcatholic: useful at mission time.A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of hiscrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of thesisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the veryreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for hispurse held, he knew, one silver crown.Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not forlong, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off bycannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinalWolseys words: IF I HAD SERVED MY GOD AS I HAVE SERVED MY KING HE WOULDNOT HAVE ABANDONED ME IN MY OLD DAYS. He walked by the treeshade ofsunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David SheehyM.P.--Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxtonprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well atBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to besure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was veryprobable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David SheehyM.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David SheehyM.P. Yes, he would certainly call.--Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at thejet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, ingoing. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on FatherBernard Vaughans droll eyes and cockney voice.--Pilate! Wy dont you old back that owlin mob?A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in.his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved theIrish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner ofMountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha.And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And whatwas his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the otherlittle man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name tohave.Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynamand pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.--But mind you dont post yourself into the box, little man, he said.The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:--O, sir.--Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmeesletter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoysquare east.Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slatefrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers,canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportmentmost respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at thecorner of Dignams court.Was that not Mrs MGuinness?Mrs MGuinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee fromthe farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled andsaluted. How did she do?A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And tothink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a ... what should hesay? ... such a queenly mien.Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at theshutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will(D.V.)speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say afew words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They actedaccording to their lights.Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. Allraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.Christian brother boys.Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. SaintJosephs church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. FatherConmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionallythey were also badtempered.Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthriftnobleman. And now it was an office or something.Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and wassaluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odoursthat came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passedGrogans the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things werecontinually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.Still, an act of perfect contrition.Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him andwere saluted.Father Conmee passed H. J. ONeills funeral establishment whereCorny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade ofhay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmeesaluted the constable. In Youkstetters, the porkbutchers, Father Conmeeobserved pigs puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled intubes.Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw aturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saintFrancis Xaviers church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outwardbound tram.Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC. C. of saint Agathas church, north William street, on to Newcomenbridge.At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorum.It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, FatherConmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,tiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,sweetly.Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seat.Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket anda marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU, MY CHILD, that they have been absolved, PRAYFOR ME. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poorcreatures.From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather Conmee.Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, LENOMBRE DES ELUS, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were Gods souls, created byGod. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, awaste, if one might say.At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by theconductor and saluted in his turn.The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road andname. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old timesin the barony.Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book OLD TIMES IN THEBARONY and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and ofMary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of loughEnnel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in theevening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth?Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had notcommitted adultery fully, EIACULATIO SEMINIS INTER VAS NATURALE MULIERIS,with her husbands brother? She would half confess if she had not allsinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husbands brother.Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, neededhowever for mans race on earth, and of the ways of God which were notour ways.Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He washumane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and hesmiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with fullfruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble tonoble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.It was a charming day.The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. MOUTONNER, the Frenchsaid. A just and homely word.Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.He was their rector: his reign was mild.Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.An ivory bookmark told him the page.Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.Father Conmee read in secret PATER and AVE and crossed his breast.DEUS IN ADIUTORIUM.He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading tillhe came to RES in BEATI IMMACULATI: PRINCIPIUM VERBORUM TUORUM VERITAS:IN ETERNUM OMNIA INDICIA IUSTITIAE TUAE.A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him camea young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young manraised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow caredetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of hisbreviary. Sin: PRINCIPES PERSECUTI SUNT ME GRATIS: ET A VERBIS TUISFORMIDAVIT COR MEUM.    * * * * *Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with hisdrooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himselferect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brassfurnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came tothe doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes andleaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram onNewcomen bridge.Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hatdowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.Constable C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.--Thats a fine day, Mr Kelleher.--Ay, Corny Kelleher said.--Its very close, the constable said.Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouthwhile a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth acoin.--Whats the best news? he asked.--I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with batedbreath.    * * * * *A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnells corner,skirting Rabaiottis icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.Towards Larry ORourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growledunamiably:--For England ...He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus,halted and growled:--HOME AND BEAUTY.J. J. OMolloys white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert wasin the warehouse with a visitor.A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and droppedit into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glancedsourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forwardfour strides.He halted and growled angrily:--FOR ENGLAND ...Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his headtowards a window and bayed deeply:--HOME AND BEAUTY.The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTSslipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen,held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A womanshand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into theminstrels cap, saying:--There, sir.    * * * * *Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteamingkitchen.--Did you put in the books? Boody asked.Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubblingsuds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.--They wouldnt give anything on them, she said.Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsockedankles tickled by stubble.--Where did you try? Boody asked.--MGuinnesss.Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.--Bad cess to her big face! she cried.Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.--Whats in the pot? she asked.--Shirts, Maggy said.Boody cried angrily:--Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:--And whats in this?A heavy fume gushed in answer.--Peasoup, Maggy said.--Where did you get it? Katey asked.--Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.The lacquey rang his bell.--Barang!Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:--Give us it here.Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouthrandom crumbs:--A good job we have that much. Wheres Dilly?--Gone to meet father, Maggy said.Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:--Our father who art not in heaven.Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Kateys bowl, exclaimed:--Boody! For shame!A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly downthe Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafedaround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,between the Customhouse old dock and Georges quay.    * * * * *The blond girl in Thorntons bedded the wicker basket with rustlingfibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paperand a small jar.--Put these in first, will you? he said.--Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.--Thatll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripeshamefaced peaches.Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about thefruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump redtomatoes, sniffing smells.H. E. L. Y.S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,plodding towards their goal.He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watchfrom his fob and held it at its chains length.--Can you send them by tram? Now?A darkbacked figure under Merchants arch scanned books on thehawkers cart.--Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?--O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.--Will you write the address, sir?Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.--Send it at once, will you? he said. Its for an invalid.--Yes, sir. I will, sir.Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers pocket.--Whats the damage? he asked.The blond girls slim fingers reckoned the fruits.Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. Hetook a red carnation from the tall stemglass.--This for me? he asked gallantly.The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tiea bit crooked, blushing.--Yes, sir, she said.Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of thered flower between his smiling teeth.--May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.    * * * * *--MA! Almidano Artifoni said.He gazed over Stephens shoulder at Goldsmiths knobby poll.Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Mens arms frankly round their stuntedforms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bankof Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.--ANCHIO HO AVUTO DI QUESTE IDEE, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, QUAND EROGIOVINE COME LEI. EPPOI MI SONO CONVINTO CHE IL MONDO E UNA BESTIA.PECCATO. PERCHE LA SUA VOCE ... SAREBBE UN CESPITE DI RENDITA, VIA.INVECE, LEI SI SACRIFICA.--SACRIFIZIO INCRUENTO, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slowswingswong from its midpoint, lightly.--SPERIAMO, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. MA, DIA RETTA AME. CI RIFLETTA.By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tramunloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.--CI RIFLETTERO, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.--MA, SUL SERIO, EH? Almidano Artifoni said.His heavy hand took Stephens firmly. Human eyes. They gazedcuriously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.--ECCOLO, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e cipensi. ADDIO, CARO.--ARRIVEDERLA, MAESTRO, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand wasfreed. E GRAZIE.--DI CHE? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? TANTE BELLE COSE!Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smugglingimplements of music through Trinity gates.    * * * * *Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of THE WOMAN IN WHITEfar back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into hertypewriter.Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogledthem: six.Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:-- June .Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypenys corner andthe slab where Wolfe Tones statue was not, eeled themselves turningH. E. L. Y.S and plodded back as they had come.Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette,and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capitalesses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. Shes not nicelooking, is she? Theway shes holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at theband tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirtlike Susy Nagles. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclubswells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he wont keep me heretill seven.The telephone rang rudely by her ear.--Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Ill ring them up after five. Onlythose two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can goafter six if youre not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven andsix. Ill tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.She scribbled three figures on an envelope.--Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you.Mr Lenehan, yes. He said hell be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes,sir. Ill ring them up after five.    * * * * *Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.--Whos that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?--Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.--Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute hispliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.The vesta in the clergymans uplifted hand consumed itself in a long softflame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy airclosed round them.--How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.--Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historiccouncil chamber of saint Marys abbey where silken Thomas proclaimedhimself a rebel in . This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.OMadden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. Theold bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and theoriginal jews temple was here too before they built their synagogue overin Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?--No, Ned.--He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if mymemory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.--Thats right, Ned Lambert said. Thats quite right, sir.--If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allowme perhaps ...--Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. Illget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here orfrom here.In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piledseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.--Im deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I wont trespass onyour valuable time ...--Youre welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Nextweek, say. Can you see?--Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.--Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath awayamong the pillars. With J. J. OMolloy he came forth slowly into Marysabbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnutmeal, OConnor, Wexford.He stood to read the card in his hand.--The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: SaintMichaels, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. Hes writing a book about theFitzgeralds he told me. Hes well up in history, faith.The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt aclinging twig.--I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. OMolloy said.Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.--God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildareafter he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? IM BLOODY SORRYI DID IT, says he, BUT I DECLARE TO GOD I THOUGHT THE ARCHBISHOP WASINSIDE. He mightnt like it, though. What? God, Ill tell him anyhow.That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all ofthem, the Geraldines.The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. Heslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:--Woa, sonny!He turned to J. J. OMolloy and asked:--Well, Jack. What is it? Whats the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after aninstant, sneezed loudly.--Chow! he said. Blast you!--The dust from those sacks, J. J. OMolloy said politely.--No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a ... cold night before ... blastyour soul ... night before last ... and there was a hell of a lot ofdraught ...He held his handkerchief ready for the coming ...--I was ... Glasnevin this morning ... poor little ... what do you callhim ... Chow! ... Mother of Moses!    * * * * *Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against hisclaret waistcoat.--See? he said. Say its turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbleda while, ceased, ogling them: six.Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from theconsolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carryingthe costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from theadmiralty division of kings bench to the court of appeal an elderlyfemale with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt ofgreat amplitude.--See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.The impact. Leverage, see?He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.--Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late cansee what turn is on and what turns are over.--See? Tom Rochford said.He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:four. Turn Now On.--Ill see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One goodturn deserves another.--Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him Im Boylan with impatience.--Goodnight, MCoy said abruptly. When you two beginNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.--But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.--Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.He followed MCoy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.--Hes a hero, he said simply.--I know, MCoy said. The drain, you mean.--Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.They passed Dan Lowrys musichall where Marie Kendall, charmingsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichallLenehan showed MCoy how the whole thing was. One of those manholeslike a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, halfchoked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, bookys vestand all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope roundthe poor devil and the two were hauled up.--The act of a hero, he said.At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop pastthem for Jervis street.--This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynams tosee Sceptres starting price. Whats the time by your gold watch andchain?MCoy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses sombre office, then atONeills clock.--After three, he said. Whos riding her?--O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.While he waited in Temple bar MCoy dodged a banana peel withgentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damneasy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregalcavalcade.--Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons inthere going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasnt anearthly. Through here.They went up the steps and under Merchants arch. A darkbackedfigure scanned books on the hawkers cart.--There he is, Lenehan said.--Wonder what hes buying, MCoy said, glancing behind.--LEOPOLDO OR THE BLOOM IS ON THE RYE, Lenehan said.--Hes dead nuts on sales, MCoy said. I was with him one day and hebought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There werefine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon andcomets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.Lenehan laughed.--Ill tell you a damn good one about comets tails, he said. Come over inthe sun.They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay bythe riverwall.Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangans, lateFehrenbachs, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.--There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan saideagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayorwas there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawsonspoke and there was music. Bartell dArcy sang and Benjamin Dollard ...--I know, MCoy broke in. My missus sang there once.--Did she? Lenehan said.A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS reappeared on the windowsash ofnumber  Eccles street.He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.--But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had thecatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife werethere. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao towhich we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids camesolids. Cold joints galore and mince pies ...--I know, MCoy said. The year the missus was there ...Lenehan linked his arm warmly.--But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after allthe jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue oclock themorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous wintersnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on oneside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singingglees and duets: LO, THE EARLY BEAM OF MORNING. She was well primed with agood load of Delahunts port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloodycar gave I had her bumping up against me. Hells delights! She has a finepair, God bless her. Like that.He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:--I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Knowwhat I mean?His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight indelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.--The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. Shes a gameymare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the cometsin the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear andHercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I waslost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last shespotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. AND WHAT STAR IS THAT, POLDY? saysshe. By God, she had Bloom cornered. THAT ONE, IS IT? says Chris Callinan,SURE THATS ONLY WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A PINPRICK. By God, he wasnt farwide of the mark.Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with softlaughter.--Im weak, he gasped.MCoys white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched hishindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at MCoy.--Hes a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. Hes not oneof your common or garden ... you know ... Theres a touch of the artistabout old Bloom.    * * * * *Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of THE AWFUL DISCLOSURES OF MARIAMONK, then of Aristotles MASTERPIECE. Crooked botched print. Plates:infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughteredcows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. Allbutting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minutesomewhere. Mrs Purefoy.He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: TALES OF THE GHETTOby Leopold von Sacher Masoch.--That I had, he said, pushing it by.The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.--Them are two good ones, he said.Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruinedmouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them againsthis unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.On OConnell bridge many persons observed the grave deportmentand gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. FAIR TYRANTS by James Lovebirch.Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.He opened it. Thought so.A womans voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.No: she wouldnt like that much. Got her it once.He read the other title: SWEETS OF SIN. More in her line. Let us see.He read where his finger opened.--ALL THE DOLLARBILLS HER HUSBAND GAVE HER WERE SPENT IN THE STORES ONWONDROUS GOWNS AND COSTLIEST FRILLIES. FOR HIM! FOR RAOUL!Yes. This. Here. Try.--HER MOUTH GLUED ON HIS IN A LUSCIOUS VOLUPTUOUS KISS WHILE HIS HANDSFELT FOR THE OPULENT CURVES INSIDE HER DESHABILLE.Yes. Take this. The end.--YOU ARE LATE, HE SPOKE HOARSELY, EYING HER WITH A SUSPICIOUS GLARE.THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THREW OFF HER SABLETRIMMED WRAP, DISPLAYING HERQUEENLY SHOULDERS AND HEAVING EMBONPOINT. AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYEDROUND HER PERFECT LIPS AS SHE TURNED TO HIM CALMLY.Mr Bloom read again: THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yieldedamply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrilsarched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (FOR HIM! FORRAOUL!). Armpits oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (HER HEAVING EMBONPOINT!).Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!Young! Young!An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts ofchancery, kings bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in thelord chancellors court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiraltydivision the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairnsversus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservationof judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and GuaranteeCorporation.Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingycurtains. The shopmans uncombed grey head came out and his unshavenreddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on thefloor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, andbent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.Mr Bloom beheld it.Mastering his troubled breath, he said:--Ill take this one.The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.--SWEETS OF SIN, he said, tapping on it. Thats a good one.    * * * * *The lacquey by the door of Dillons auctionrooms shook his handbelltwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains.Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance onfive shillings? Going for five shillings.The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:--Barang!Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretchednecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williamssrow. He halted near his daughter.--Its time for you, she said.--Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are youtrying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?Melancholy God!Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on themand held them back.--Stand up straight, girl, he said. Youll get curvature of the spine.Do you know what you look like?He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching hisshoulders and dropping his underjaw.--Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.--Did you get any money? Dilly asked.--Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublinwould lend me fourpence.--You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.--How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldlyalong Jamess street.--I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?--I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taughtyou to be so saucy? Here.He handed her a shilling.--See if you can do anything with that, he said.--I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.--Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. Youre like the rest ofthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor motherdied. But wait awhile. Youll all get a short shrift and a long day fromme. Low blackguardism! Im going to get rid of you. Wouldnt care if I wasstretched out stiff. Hes dead. The man upstairs is dead.He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.--Well, what is it? he said, stopping.The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.--Barang!--Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bellbut feebly:--Bang!Mr Dedalus stared at him.--Watch him, he said. Its instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.--You got more than that, father, Dilly said.--Im going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. Ill leave youall where Jesus left the jews. Look, theres all I have. I got twoshillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for thefuneral.He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.--Cant you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.--I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in OConnellstreet. Ill try this one now.--Youre very funny, Dilly said, grinning.--Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk foryourself and a bun or a something. Ill be home shortly.He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, outof Parkgate.--Im sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.The lacquey banged loudly.Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with apursing mincing mouth gently:--The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldnt do anything!O, sure they wouldnt really! Is it little sister Monica!    * * * * *From the sundial towards Jamess gate walked Mr Kernan, pleasedwith the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly alongJamess street, past Shackletons offices. Got round him all right. How doyou do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in yourother establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.Lovely weather were having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Thosefarmers are always grumbling. Ill just take a thimbleful of your bestgin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that GeneralSlocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. Andheartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutalthing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Mostscandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehoseall burst. What I cant understand is how the inspectors ever allowed aboat like that ... Now, youre talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You knowwhy? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that.And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.I smiled at him. AMERICA, I said quietly, just like that. WHAT IS IT? THESWEEPINGS OF EVERY COUNTRY INCLUDING OUR OWN. ISNT THAT TRUE? Thatsa fact.Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where theres money going theresalways someone to pick it up.Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like adressy appearance. Bowls them over.--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of PeterKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawsonstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never builtunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street clubtoff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank,gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he rememberedme.Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of yourcustom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the oldsaying has it.North wall and sir John Rogersons quay, with hulls andanchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway,rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpybody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that NedLamberts brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. Hes as like it as damnit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flashlike that. Damn like him.Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Gooddrop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to hisfat strut.Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy blackrope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenantswife drove by in her noddy.Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great toperstoo. Fourbottle men.Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michans? Or no, there was amidnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door inthe wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turndown here. Make a detour.Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street bythe corner of Guinnesss visitors waitingroom. Outside the DublinDistillers Companys stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperarybosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in JohnHenry Mentons office, led his wife over OConnell bridge, bound for theoffice of Messrs Collis and Ward.Mr Kernan approached Island street.Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscencesof sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind ofretrospective arrangement. Gaming at Dalys. No cardsharping then.One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stablesbehind Moira house.Damn good gin that was.Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, thatsham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were onthe wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.Masterly rendition.    AT THE SIEGE OF ROSS DID MY FATHER FALL.A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outridersleaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!    * * * * *Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidarysfingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and theshowtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar,on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lightsshining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of theirbrows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. Asailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long andseafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and herhips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem,turned it and held it at the point of his Moses beard. Grandfather apegloating on a stolen hoard.And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsickwords of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheatstanding from everlasting to everlasting.Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged throughIrishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, onewith a midwifes bag in which eleven cockles rolled.The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from thepowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb alwayswithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I betweenthem. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatterthem, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you whocan. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A lookaround.Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. Yousay right, sir. A Monday morning, twas so, indeed.Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clackingagainst his shoulderblade. In Clohisseys window a faded O print ofHeenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stoodround the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposedgently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroeshearts.He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.--Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.Tattered pages. THE IRISH BEEKEEPER. LIFE AND MIRACLES OF THE CURE OFARS. POCKET GUIDE TO KILLARNEY.I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. STEPHANO DEDALO,ALUMNO OPTIMO, PALMAM FERENTI.Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through thehamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book ofMoses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read andread. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a womans love. For me this.Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:--SE EL YILO NEBRAKADA FEMININUM! AMOR ME SOLO! SANKTUS! AMEN.Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbotPeter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbotscharms, as mumbling Joachims. Down, baldynoddle, or well wool your wool.--What are you doing here, Stephen?Dillys high shoulders and shabby dress.Shut the book quick. Dont let see.--What are you doing? Stephen said.A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. Itglowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her ofParis. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeckbracelet, Dan Kellys token. NEBRAKADA FEMININUM.--What have you there? Stephen asked.--I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughingnervously. Is it any good?My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far anddaring. Shadow of my mind.He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenals French primer.--What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.Show no surprise. Quite natural.--Here, Stephen said. Its all right. Mind Maggy doesnt pawn it on you. Isuppose all my books are gone.--Some, Dilly said. We had to.She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She willdrown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,my heart, my soul. Salt green death.We.Agenbite of inwit. Inwits agenbite.Misery! Misery!    * * * * *--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughters. FatherCowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.--Whats the best news? Mr Dedalus said.--Why then not much, Father Cowley said. Im barricaded up, Simon, withtwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.--Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?--O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.--With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.--The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. Im justwaiting for Ben Dollard. Hes going to say a word to long John to get himto take those two men off. All I want is a little time.He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulgingin his neck.--I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! Hes alwaysdoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.--There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.Ben Dollards loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slopscrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards themat an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:--Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.--Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of BenDollards figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he mutteredsneeringly:--Thats a pretty garment, isnt it, for a summers day?--Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, Ithrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomyclothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:--They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.--Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be toGod hes not paid yet.--And how is that BASSO PROFONDO, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanters mouth, gaveforth a deep note.--Aw! he said.--Thats the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.--What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?He turned to both.--Thatll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse ofsaint Marys abbey past James and Charles Kennedys, rectifiers, attendedby Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford ofhurdles.Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,his joyful fingers in the air.--Come along with me to the subsheriffs office, he said. I want to showyou the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. Hes a cross between Lobengulaand Lynchehaun. Hes well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw JohnHenry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall ifI dont ... Wait awhile ... Were on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.--For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a danglingbutton of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped awaythe heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.--What few days? he boomed. Hasnt your landlord distrained for rent?--He has, Father Cowley said.--Then our friends writ is not worth the paper its printed on, Ben Dollardsaid. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. Windsor avenue. Love is the name?--Thats right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. Hes a ministerin the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?--You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put thatwrit where Jacko put the nuts.He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.--Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasseson his coatfront, following them.    * * * * *--The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passedout of the Castleyard gate.The policeman touched his forehead.--God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set ontowards Lord Edward street.Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedys head by Miss Douces head,appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.--Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to FatherConmee and laid the whole case before him.--You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.--Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after themquickly down Cork hill.On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailedAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.--Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the MAILoffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.--Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down thefive shillings too.--Without a second word either, Mr Power said.--Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.--Ill say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.They went down Parliament street.--Theres Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanaghs.--Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.Outside LA MAISON CLAIRE Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooneysbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while MartinCunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit,who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Andersons watches.--The assistant town clerks corns are giving him some trouble, John WyseNolan told Mr Power.They followed round the corner towards James Kavanaghswinerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. MartinCunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henrydid not glance.--And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large aslife.The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where hestood.--Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted andgreeted.Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Claydecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over alltheir faces.--Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he saidwith rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted toknow, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow themacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, noquorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and littleLorcan Sherlock doing LOCUM TENENS for him. Damned Irish language,language of our forefathers.Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, tothe assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan heldhis peace.--What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.--O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness sake tillI sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fannings flankand passed in and up the stairs.--Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I dont thinkyou knew him or perhaps you did, though.With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.--Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of longJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.--Rather lowsized. Dignam of Mentons office that was, MartinCunningham said. Long John Fanning could not remember him. Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.--Whats that? Martin Cunningham said.All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again.From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliamentstreet, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily theywent past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of theleaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.--What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up thestaircase.--The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John WyseNolan answered from the stairfoot.    * * * * *As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behindhis Panama to Haines:--Parnells brother. There in the corner.They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced manwhose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.--Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.--Yes, Mulligan said. Thats John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his greyclaw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe andfell once more upon a working corner.--Ill take a MELANGE, Haines said to the waitress.--Two MELANGES, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butterand some cakes as well.When she had gone he said, laughing:--We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missedDedalus on HAMLET.Haines opened his newbought book.--Im sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all mindsthat have lost their balance.The onelegged sailor growled at the area of  Nelson street:--ENGLAND EXPECTS ...Buck Mulligans primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.--You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. WanderingAengus I call him.--I am sure he has an IDEE FIXE, Haines said, pinching his chinthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it wouldbe likely to be. Such persons always have.Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.--They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will nevercapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the whitedeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.The joy of creation ...--Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled himthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. Itsrather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes aninteresting point out of that.Buck Mulligans watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped herto unload her tray.--He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amidthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, ofretribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does hewrite anything for your movement?He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whippedcream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butterover its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.--Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write somethingin ten years.--Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.Still, I shouldnt wonder if he did after all.He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.--This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.I dont want to be imposed on.Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks ofships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wappingstreet past Bensons ferry, and by the threemasted schooner ROSEVEAN fromBridgwater with bricks.    * * * * *Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewells yard.Behind him Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, withstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smithshouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him ablind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far asMr Lewis Werners cheerful windows, then turned and strode back alongMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.At the corner of Wildes house he halted, frowned at Elijahs nameannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance ofdukes lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteethbared he muttered:--COACTUS VOLUI.He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.As he strode past Mr Blooms dental windows the sway of hisdustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and sweptonwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned hissickly face after the striding form.--Gods curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! Youre blinder norI am, you bitchs bastard!    * * * * *Opposite Ruggy ODonohoes Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam,pawing the pound and a half of Mangans, late Fehrenbachs, porksteaks hehad been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was tooblooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley andMrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles andsipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought fromTunneys. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing thewhole blooming time and sighing.After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdressmilliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped totheir pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourningMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublins pet lamb, will meetsergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fiftysovereigns. Gob, thatd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,thats the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance,soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on hisleft turned as he turned. Thats me in mourning. When is it? May thetwentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the rightand on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar stickingup. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall,charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be inthe packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out ofhim for one time he found out.Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best puckergoing for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellowwould knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best puckerfor science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out ofhim, dodging and all.In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toffs mouthand a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk wastelling him and grinning all the time.No Sandymount tram.Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks tohis other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. Theblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming endto it. He met schoolboys with satchels. Im not going tomorrow either,stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice Im inmourning? Uncle Barney said hed get it into the paper tonight. Thentheyll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pas name.His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was afly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they werescrewing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringingit downstairs.Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney tellingthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high andheavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standingon the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunneys forto boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see himagain. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be agood son to ma. I couldnt hear the other things he said but I saw histongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam,my father. I hope hes in purgatory now because he went to confession toFather Conroy on Saturday night.    * * * * *William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied bylieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregallodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss deCourcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park salutedby obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along thenorthern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way throughthe metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the rivergreeted him vainly from afar Between Queens and Whitworth bridges lordDudleys viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr DudleyWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. Whites,the pawnbrokers, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nosewith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsboroughmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on footthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In theporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at thedoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for thePatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changedher plan and retracing her steps by Kings windows smiled credulouslyon the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quaywall under Tom Devans office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongueof liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold bybronze, Miss Kennedys head by Miss Douces head watched and admired.On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhousefor the subsheriffs office, stood still in midstreet and brought hishat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus greeting. FromCahills corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisanceunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignanthad held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and MCoy,taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by RogerGreenes office and Dollards big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,carrying the Catesbys cork lino letters for her father who was laid up,knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldnt seewhat Her Excellency had on because the tram and Springs big yellowfurniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lordlieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foots from the shaded door of Kavanaghswinerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lordlieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right HonourableWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Andersonsall times ticking watches and Henry and Jamess wax smartsuitedfreshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, DERNIER CRI James. Over againstDame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of thecavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him,took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat anddoffed his cap to her. A charming SOUBRETTE, great Marie Kendall, withdauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon WilliamHumble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, andalso upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of theD. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on theviceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of formsdarkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. InFowness street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward fromChardenals first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokesspinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway ofCommercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat goldhunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where theforeleg of King Billys horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked herhastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shoutedin his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his leftbreast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonbys corner a jadedwhite flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behindhim, E.L.YS, while outriders pranced past and carriages. OppositePigotts music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.By the provosts wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoesand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of MY GIRLS A YORKSHIREGIRL.Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders skyblue frontlets and highaction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suitof indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but heoffered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the redflower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellencydrew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music whichwas being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddiesblared and drumthumped after the CORTEGE:    BUT THOUGH SHES A FACTORY LASS    AND WEARS NO FANCY CLOTHES.    BARAABUM.    YET IVE A SORT OF A    YORKSHIRE RELISH FOR    MY LITTLE YORKSHIRE ROSE.    BARAABUM.Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finnshotel Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through afierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons inthe window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster streetby Trinitys postern a loyal kings man, Hornblower, touched his tallyhocap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master PatrickAloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with thetopper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased byporksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way toinaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercers hospital,drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blindstripling opposite Broadbents. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in abrown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across theviceroys path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr EugeneStratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroketownship. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves,an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonderthe lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. OnNorthumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctuallysalutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at thegarden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen whenvisiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in and the salute of Almidano Artifonis sturdy trousers swallowed by aclosing door.    * * * * * * *Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing Imperthnthn thnthnthn.Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.Horrid!

Tempting poor simple males.Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.--O go away! she said. Youre very simple, I dont think.He was.--Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christenedme simple Simon.--You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did thedoctor order today?--Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think Ill trouble youfor some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.Jingle.--With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell andCochranes she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of goldwhisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalusbrought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue twohusky fifenotes.--By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must bea great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last,they say. Yes. Yes.Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaids, intothe bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.None nought said nothing.

Blue bloom is on the rye.--He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.Lenehan came forward.--Was Mr Boylan looking for me?He asked. She answered:--Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised,her gaze upon a page:--No. He was not.Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.

O my!He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.--Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.--Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?--Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.Dry.Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.--I see, he said. I didnt recognise him for the moment. I hear he iskeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?He had.--I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. InMooneys EN VILLE and in Mooneys SUR MER. He had received the rhino forthe labour of his muse.He smiled at bronzes teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:--The ELITE of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, HughMacHugh, Dublins most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boyof the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of theOMadden Burke.After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and--That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set downhis glass.He looked towards the saloon door.--I see you have moved the piano.--The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smokingconcert and I never heard such an exquisite player.--Is that a fact?--Didnt he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,poor fellow. Not twenty Im sure he was.--Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.He drank and strayed away.--So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.Gods curse on bitchs bastard.Tink to her pity cried a diners bell. To the door of the bar anddiningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter ofOrmond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, forjinglejaunty blazes boy.Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at theoblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressedindulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see thethicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I wasin Wisdom Helys wise Bloom in Dalys Henry Flower bought.

Longer in dying call.Pat paid for diners popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray andpopcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with missDouce.--THE BRIGHT STARS FADE ...A voiceless song sang from within, singing:-- ...

Dinner fit for a prince.Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm,her bust, that all but burst, so high.--O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.--Why dont you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for hislips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), andsyrupped with her voice:--Fine goods in small parcels.That is to say she.

Im on two minds not to give thatfellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms andladders.--What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.--Devil a much, says I.

A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. Imhanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I cant get a pennyout of him.--That the lay youre on now? says Joe.--Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtfuldebts. But thats the most notorious bloody robber youd meet in a dayswalk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. TELLHIM, says he, I DARE HIM, says he, AND I DOUBLEDARE HIM TO SEND YOU ROUNDHERE AGAIN OR IF HE DOES, says he, ILL HAVE HIM SUMMONSED UP BEFORE THECOURT, SO I WILL, FOR TRADING WITHOUT A LICENCE.

I want to see the citizen.--Barney mavourneens be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?--Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.---What was that, Joe? says I.--Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want togive the citizen the hard word about it.So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of thecourthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he hasit but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldnt get over thatbloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence,says he.In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. Thererises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as inlife they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land itis in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard,the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse,the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fishgenerally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to beenumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the loftytrees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the waftysycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugeniceucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which thatregion is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximityto the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while theyplay with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots,silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels offingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.  And heroes voyage fromafar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes ofunfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinsterand of Cruahans land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble districtof Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen bymariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for thatpurpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of thatland for OConnell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descendedfrom chieftains.  Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of thefields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks,Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes,spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, andtrays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms andcustard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellowbrown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips ofstrawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, andstrawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty,you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers andflushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and mediumsteers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheepand Cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and thevarious different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angusheifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with primepremiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine frompasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy valesof Thomond, from the MGillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordlyShannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place ofthe race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk andbutts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets oflamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various insize, the agate with this dun.So we turned into Barney Kiernans and there, sure enough, was the citizenup in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloodymangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would dropin the way of drink.--There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and hisload of papers, working for the cause.The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.  Bea corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of thatbloody dog. Im told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off aconstabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paperabout a licence.--Stand and deliver, says he.--Thats all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.--Pass, friends, says he.Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:--Whats your opinion of the times?Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal tothe occasion.--I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down hisfork.So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:--Foreign wars is the cause of it.And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:--Its the Russians wish to tyrannise.--Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. Ive a thirst on me Iwouldnt sell for half a crown.--Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.--Wine of the country, says he.--Whats yours? says Joe.--Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.--Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And hows the old heart, citizen? says he.--Never better, A CHARA, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neckand, by Jesus, he near throttled him.The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round towerwas that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyedredhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosedlongheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfacedsinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells andhis rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest ofhis body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair inhue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (ULEX EUROPEUS). Thewidewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected,were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity thefieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear anda smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsizedcauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervalsfrom the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance theloud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thunderedrumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the stillloftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to theknees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle ofplaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughlystitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbrigganbuskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of saltedcowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.

Acouched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feetreposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gaspsannounced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed byhoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from timeto time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out ofpaleolithic stone.So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begobthe sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true asIm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.--And theres more where that came from, says he.--Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.--Sweat of my brow, says Joe. Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.--I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane andGreek street with his cods eye counting up all the guts of the fish.Who comes through Michans land, bedight in sable armour? OBloom,the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rorys son: heof the prudent soul.--For the old woman of Princes street, says the citizen, the subsidisedorgan. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at thisblasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. THE IRISH INDEPENDENT, if youplease, founded by Parnell to be the workingmans friend. Listen to thebirths and deaths in the IRISH ALL FOR IRELAND INDEPENDENT, and Ill thankyou and the marriages.And he starts reading them out:--Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Annes onSea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. Hows that, eh? Wright andFlint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the lateGeorge Alfred Gillett,  Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood andRidsdale at Saint Judes, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, deanof Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, StokeNewington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house,Chepstow ...--I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.--Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June , at  Canning street,Liverpool, Isabella Helen. Hows that for a national press, eh, my brownson! Hows that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?--Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they hadthe start of us. Drink that, citizen.--I will, says he, honourable person.--Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.Ah! Ow! Dont be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of thatpint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with aclick.And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger cameswiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind himthere passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacredscrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,fairest of her race.Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barneyssnug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in thecorner that I hadnt seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.I didnt know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. Andbegob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in hisbathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wifehotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. Ithought Alf would split.--Look at him, says he. Breen. Hes traipsing all round Dublin with apostcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li ...And he doubled up.--Take a what? says I.--Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.--O hell! says I.The bloody mongrel began to growl thatd put the fear of God in youseeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.--BI I DHO HUSHT, says he.--Who? says Joe.--Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Mentons and then he went roundto Collis and Wards and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him roundto the subsheriffs for a lark. O God, Ive a pain laughing. U. p: up. Thelong fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody oldlunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.--When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.--Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?--Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us apony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen longJohns eye. U. p ...And he started laughing.--Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?--Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.Terence ORyan heard him and straightway brought him a crystalcup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveaghand Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons ofdeathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and massand sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices andbring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from theirtoil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him thatthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.But he, the young chief of the OBergans, could ill brook to be outdonein generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoonof costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen theimage of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoriaher name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyondthe sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, whobore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knewand loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, thepale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.--Whats that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up anddown outside?--Whats that? says Joe.--Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,Ill show you something you never saw. Hangmens letters. Look at here.So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.--Are you codding? says I.--Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.So Joe took up the letters.--Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bobs a queer chapwhen the porters up in him so says I just to make talk:--Hows Willy Murray those times, Alf?--I dont know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with PaddyDignam. Only I was running after that ...--You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?--With Dignam, says Alf.--Is it Paddy? says Joe.--Yes, says Alf. Why?--Dont you know hes dead? says Joe.--Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.--Ay, says Joe.--Sure Im after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as apikestaff.--Whos dead? says Bob Doran.--You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.--What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five ... What? ... And Willy Murraywith him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhims ... What?Dignam dead?--What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Whos talking about ...?--Dead! says Alf. Hes no more dead than you are.--Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morninganyhow.--Paddy? says Alf.--Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.--Good Christ! says Alf.Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer bytantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasingluminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of theetheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivicrays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effectedthrough the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery andscarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questionedby his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated thathe was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted totrial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astrallevels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the greatdivide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darklybut that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmicdevelopment opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life thereresembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard frommore favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equippedwith every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda,wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcyof the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this wasbrought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any messagefor the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Mayato acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles thatMars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where theram has power. It was then queried whether there were any specialdesires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: WE GREET YOU,FRIENDS OF EARTH, WHO ARE STILL IN THE BODY. MIND C. K. DOESNT PILE ITON. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher,manager of Messrs H. J. ONeills popular funeral establishment, apersonal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carryingout of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that itshould be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had beenlooking for was at present under the commode in the return room and thatthe pair should be sent to Cullens to be soled only as the heels werestill good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind inthe other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be madeknown.Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it wasintimated that this had given satisfaction.He is gone from mortal haunts: ODignam, sun of our morning. Fleetwas his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, withyour wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.--There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.--Who? says I.--Bloom, says he. Hes on point duty up and down there for the last tenminutes.And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.--Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowestblackguard in Dublin when hes under the influence:--Who said Christ is good?--I beg your parsnips, says Alf.--Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little WillyDignam?--Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. Hes over all his troubles.But Bob Doran shouts out of him.--Hes a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that theydidnt want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And BobDoran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as youre there.--The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat.Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,Mooney, the bumbailiffs daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street,that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me thatwas stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposingher person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.--The noblest, the truest, says he. And hes gone, poor little Willy, poorlittle Paddy Dignam.And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of thatbeam of heaven.Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezinground the door.--Come in, come on, he wont eat you, says the citizen.So Bloom slopes in with his cods eye on the dog and he asks Terrywas Martin Cunningham there.--O, Christ MKeown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this,will you?And he starts reading out one.                 HUNTER STREET, LIVERPOOL.        TO THE HIGH SHERIFF OF DUBLIN, DUBLIN.    HONOURED SIR I BEG TO OFFER MY SERVICES IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAINFULCASE I HANGED JOE GANN IN BOOTLE JAIL ON THE  OF FEBUARY  AND IHANGED ...--Show us, Joe, says I.-- ... PRIVATE ARTHUR CHACE FOR FOWL MURDER OF JESSIE TILSIT INPENTONVILLE PRISON AND I WAS ASSISTANT WHEN ...--Jesus, says I.-- ... BILLINGTON EXECUTED THE AWFUL MURDERER TOAD SMITH ...The citizen made a grab at the letter.--Hold hard, says Joe, I HAVE A SPECIAL NACK OF PUTTING THE NOOSE ONCE INHE CANT GET OUT HOPING TO BE FAVOURED I REMAIN, HONOURED SIR, MY TERMS ISFIVE GINNEES.            H. RUMBOLD,                MASTER BARBER.--And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.--And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take themto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldntand he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he saidwell hed just take a cigar. Gob, hes a prudent member and no mistake.--Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning cardwith a black border round it.--Theyre all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hangtheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.And he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull hisheels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then theychop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Theirdeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoeverwight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even sosaith the Lord.So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloomcomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of thebusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time Im told those jewiesdoes have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I dontknow what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.--Theres one thing it hasnt a deterrent effect on, says Alf.--Whats that? says Joe.--The poor buggers tool thats being hanged, says Alf.--That so? says Joe.--Gods truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was inKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me whenthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like apoker.--Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.--That can be explained by science, says Bloom. Its only a naturalphenomenon, dont you see, because on account of the ...And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon andscience and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumendufttendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture ofthe cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculatedto inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulusof the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elasticpores of the CORPORA CAVERNOSA to rapidly dilate in such a way as toinstantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the humananatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon whichhas been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwardsphiloprogenitive erection IN ARTICULO MORTIS PER DIMINUTIONEM CAPITIS.So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word andhe starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard andthe men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe withhim about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for thecause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that andthe other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog sohe ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the placeand scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that wasstanding Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course BobDoran starts doing the bloody fool with him:--Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the pawhere! Give us the paw!Arrah, bloody end to the paw hed paw and Alf trying to keep himfrom tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and hetalking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbreddog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scrapinga few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs tin he told Terryto bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hangingout of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloodymongrel.And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, thebrothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and RobertEmmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about SaraCurran and shes far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with hisknockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon!The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like aballalley. Time they were stopping up in the CITY ARMS pisser Burke toldme there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew andBloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playingbezique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meatof a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and takingthe lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunkas a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcoholand by herrings, if the three women didnt near roast him, its a queerstory, the old one, Blooms wife and Mrs ODowd that kept the hotel.Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.And Bloom with his BUT DONT YOU SEE? and BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. And sure,more be token, the lout Im told was in Powers after, the blenders,round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the weekafter drinking his way through all the samples in the bloodyestablishment. Phenomenon!--The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass andglaring at Bloom.--Ay, ay, says Joe.--You dont grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is ...--SINN FEIN! says the citizen. SINN FEIN AMHAIN! The friends we love areby our side and the foes we hate before us.The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries farand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around thegloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drumspunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafeningclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up theghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent itssupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rainpoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared headsof the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation fivehundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan policesuperintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order inthe vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled awaythe intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdrapedinstruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle bySperanzas plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholsteredcharabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins ofwhom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was causedby the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang TheNIGHT BEFORE LARRY WAS STRETCHED in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets amonglovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart forreal Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearnedpennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital whothronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with thisunexpected addition to the days entertainment and a word of praise is dueto the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affordingthe poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies waschaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on thegrandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friendsof the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.The delegation, present in full force, consisted of CommendatoreBacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed DOYEN of the party who hadto be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane),Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitepatant, the Grandjoker VladinmirePokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph vonSchwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Viraga Kisaszony Putrapesthi,Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba BacksheeshRahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo yPalabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri,Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps,Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch,Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent-generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in thestrongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the namelessbarbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animatedaltercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I.as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correctdate of the birth of Irelands patron saint. In the course of theargument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pigiron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The babypoliceman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier fromBooterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitudeproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable forboth contending parties. The readywitted ninefooters suggestion at onceappealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden washeartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom werebleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricatedfrom underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legaladviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in histhirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from thepockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to theirsenses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies andgentlemens gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to theirrightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultlessmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the GLADIOLUS CRUENTUS.He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which somany have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short, painstaking yet withalso characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsmanwas greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, theviceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while theeven more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley ofcries, HOCH, BANZAI, ELJEN, ZIVIO, CHINCHIN, POLLA KRONIA, HIPHIP, VIVE,ALLAH, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which theeunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easilydistinguishable. It was exactly seventeen oclock. The signal for prayerwas then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads werebared, the commendatores patriarchal sombrero, which has been in thepossession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed byhis medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate whoadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr whenabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a poolof rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to thethrone of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stoodthe grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in atengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through whichhis eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal hetested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon hisbrawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock ofsheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessaryoffice. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged thequartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances(specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Roundand Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of theduodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfullyextracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the mostprecious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of theamalgamated cats and dogs home was in attendance to convey thesevessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite anexcellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions,done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea hadbeen considerately provided by the authorities for the consumptionof the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spiritswhen prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in theproceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rarein these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed thedying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should bedivided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigentroomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem. The NEC andNON PLUS ULTRA of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect bursther way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself uponthe muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity forher sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuringfondly SHEILA, MY OWN. Encouraged by this use of her christian name shekissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which thedecencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to himas they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would evercherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went tohis death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurlingmatch in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happydays of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when theyhad indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of thedreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators,including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. Thatmonster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcomewith grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent oftears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people,touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the leastaffected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers ofthe peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary,were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to saythat there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A mostromantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate,noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and,presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree,solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her toname the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in theaudience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasionin the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generousact which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallantyoung Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonourednames in Albions history) placed on the finger of his blushing FIANCEEan expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of afourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson,who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable numberof sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrainhis natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtivetear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to bein his immediate ENTOURAGE, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:--God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse way.So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and thecorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speaktheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone fora quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump thathe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and theantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreatingis about the size of it. Gob, hed let you pour all manner of drinkdown his throat till the Lord would call him before youd eversee the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellowinto one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she couldget up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellowwith a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lotof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medalsand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolaghentertainment, dont be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And thenan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougersshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two skypilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females,hitting below the belt.So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was emptystarts mousing around by Joe and me. Id train him by kindness, so Iwould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again whereit wouldnt blind him.--Afraid hell bite you? says the citizen, jeering.--No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.So he calls the old dog over.--Whats on you, Garry? says he.Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish andthe old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone thathas nothing better to do ought to write a letter PRO BONO PUBLICO to thepapers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling andgrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and thehydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.All those who are interested in the spread of human culture amongthe lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of notmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by thefamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET ofGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends andacquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years oftraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises,among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest livingphonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stoneunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and hasfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance (the italics are ours) to the rannsof ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightfullovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under thegraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised thebookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in aninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary) of theharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusionsof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a moremodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin aspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose thoughwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rathermore than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original,which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules ofthe Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe ourreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhapsit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owensverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestiveof suppressed rancour.    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS    ON YOU, BARNEY KIERNAN,    HAS NO SUP OF WATER    TO COOL MY COURAGE,    AND MY GUTS RED ROARING    AFTER LOWRYS LIGHTS.So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you couldhear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he haveanother.--I will, says he, A CHARA, to show theres no ill feeling.Gob, hes not as green as hes cabbagelooking. Arsing around fromone pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltraps dogand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment forman and beast. And says Joe:--Could you make a hole in another pint?--Could a swim duck? says I.--Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you wont have anything in theway of liquid refreshment? says he.--Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meetMartin Cunningham, dont you see, about this insurance of poor Dignams.Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didntserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time andnominally under the act the mortgagee cant recover on the policy.--Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, thats a good one if old Shylock islanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?--Well, thats a point, says Bloom, for the wifes admirers.--Whose admirers? says Joe.--The wifes advisers, I mean, says Bloom.Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the actlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit ofthe wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignamowed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested themortgagees right till he near had the head of me addled with hismortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasnt run in himself underthe act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privilegedlottery. True as youre there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal andprivileged Hungarian robbery.So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell MrsDignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about thefuneral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said thatthere was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy thats dead to tellher. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Blooms hand doing thetragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. Youre a rogue and Imanother.--Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, howeverslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request ofyou this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reservelet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.--No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives whichactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrustto me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one ofsorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure thebitterness of the cup.--Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, Ifeel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words theexpressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whosepoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even ofspeech.And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at fiveoclock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby,A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closingtime, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porterout of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, JosephManuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass inAdam and Eves when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the newtestament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the twoshawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloodyfool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawlsscreeching laughing at one another. HOW IS YOUR TESTAMENT? HAVE YOUGOT AN OLD TESTAMENT? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, andshe wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent bootson her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.Jack Mooneys sister. And the old prostitute of a motherprocuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Toldhim if he didnt patch up the pot, Jesus, hed kick the shite out of him.So Terry brought the three pints.--Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.--SLAN LEAT, says he.--Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want asmall fortune to keep him in drinks.--Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.--Friend of yours, says Alf.--Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?--I wont mention any names, says Alf.--I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with WilliamField, M. P., the cattle traders.--Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of allcountries and the idol of his own.So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease andthe cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sendingthem all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for thescab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedyfor timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knackers yard.Walking about with his book and pencil heres my head and my heels arecoming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to agrazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers oftears some times with Mrs ODowd crying her eyes out with her eight inchesof fat all over her. Couldnt loosen her farting strings but old cods eyewas waltzing around her showing her how to do it. Whats your programmetoday? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and expertssay and the best known remedy that doesnt cause pain to the animal andon the sore spot administer gently. Gob, hed have a soft hand under ahen.Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggsfor us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook.Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takesher fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.--Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to Londonto ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.--Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him,as it happens.--Well, hes going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.--Thats too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Fieldis going. I couldnt phone. No. Youre sure?--Nannans going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a questiontomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in thepark. What do you think of that, citizen? THE SLUAGH NA H-EIREANN.Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of myhonourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the righthonourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that theseanimals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming asto their pathological condition?Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already inpossession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to thehonourable members question is in the affirmative.Mr Orelli OReilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued forthe slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in thePhoenix park?Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentlemans famousMitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasurybench? (O! O!)Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Dont hesitate to shoot.(Ironical opposition cheers.)The speaker: Order! Order!(The house rises. Cheers.)--Theres the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There heis sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion ofall Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw,citizen?--NA BACLEIS , says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a timeI was as good as the next fellow anyhow.--Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.--Is that really a fact? says Alf.--Yes, says Bloom. Thats well known. Did you not know that?So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawntennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil andbuilding up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom hadto have his say too about if a fellow had a rowers heart violentexercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up astraw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: LOOK AT, BLOOM.DO YOU SEE THAT STRAW? THATS A STRAW. Declare to my aunt hed talkabout it for an hour so he would and talk steady.A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of BRIANOCIARNAINS in SRAID NA BRETAINE BHEAG, under the auspices of SLUAGH NAH-EIREANN, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance ofphysical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome andancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable presidentof the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of largedimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificentoration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting andinstructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellenceensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancientgames and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. Thewellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our oldtongue, Mr Joseph MCarthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal forthe resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes,practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive thebest traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us fromancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause andhisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought thediscussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and heartyplaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthyrendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis evergreen verses (happilytoo familiar to need recalling here) A NATION ONCE AGAIN in the executionof which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear ofcontradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldiwas in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to thegreatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizencan sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superqualitygreatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferouslyapplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed manyprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the pressand the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings thenterminated.Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J.,L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh,C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; therev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev.Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.;the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A.Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr MManus,V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P.P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman,P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke,etc., etc.--Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennettmatch?--No, says Joe.--I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.--Who? Blazes? says Joe.And says Bloom:--What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training theeye.--Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run upthe odds and he swatting all the time.--We know him, says the citizen. The traitors son. We know what putEnglish gold in his pocket.---True for you, says Joe.And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of theblood, asking Alf:--Now, dont you think, Bergan?--Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only abloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See thelittle kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gavehim one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him pukewhat he never ate.It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy werescheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicappedas he was by lack of poundage, Dublins pet lamb made up for it bysuperlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was agruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor hadtapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keoghhad been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artillerymanputting in some neat work on the pets nose, and Myler came onlooking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with apowerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shootingout a stiff one flush to the point of Bennetts jaw. The redcoatducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch beinga fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and gothis man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Mylerpunishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, tookhis corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bellwent came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out thefistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best manfor it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. Thereferee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was trickyand his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesiesduring which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freelyfrom his opponents mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man andlanded a terrific left to Battling Bennetts stomach, flooring him flat.It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobellobruiser was being counted out when Bennetts second Ole Pfotts Wettsteinthrew in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenziedcheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed himwith delight.--He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear hes runninga concert tour now up in the north.--He is, says Joe. Isnt he?--Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. Thats quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour,you see. Just a holiday.--Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isnt she? says Joe.--My wife? says Bloom. Shes singing, yes. I think it will be a successtoo.Hes an excellent man to organise. Excellent.Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanutand absence of hair on the animals chest. Blazes doing the tootle on theflute. Concert tour.

J. Whatll it be, Ned?--Half one, says Ned.So J. J. ordered the drinks.--Were you round at the court? says Joe.--Yes, says J. J. Hell square that, Ned, says he.--Hope so, says Ned.Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury listand the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbss.Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in theireye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one wouldknow him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing hisboots out of the pop. Whats your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and donesays I. Gob, hell come home by weeping cross one of those days, Imthinking.--Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.--Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.--Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court onlyCorny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examinedfirst.--Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, Id give anything to hearhim before a judge and jury.--Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothingbut the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.--Me? says Alf. Dont cast your nasturtiums on my character.--Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidenceagainst you.--Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is notCOMPOS MENTIS. U. p: up.--COMPOS your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that hes balmy?Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat onwith a shoehorn.--Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictmentfor publishing it in the eyes of the law.--Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.--Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.--Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half andhalf.--How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he ...--Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow thats neither fish norflesh.--Nor good red herring, says Joe.--That whats I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what thatis.Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant onaccount of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after theold stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloodypovertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she marriedhim because a cousin of his old fellows was pewopener to the pope.Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeneys moustaches, thesignior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the HolyFather, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.

J., a postcard is publication. It was held to besufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In myopinion an action might lie.Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drinkour pints in peace. Gob, we wont be let even do that much itself.--Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.--Good health, Ned, says J. J.---There he is again, says Joe.--Where? says Alf.And begob there he was passing the door with his books under hisoxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye lookingin as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him asecondhand coffin.--How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.--Remanded, says J. J.One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of JamesWought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers sayinghed give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any greenin the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindledthem all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his ownkidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky orsomething weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by theholy Moses he was stuck for two quid.--Who tried the case? says Joe.--Recorder, says Ned.--Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.--Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrearsof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, hell dissolve intears on the bench.--Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didnt clap him in the dockthe other day for suing poor little Gumley thats minding stones, for thecorporation there near Butt bridge.And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:--A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How manychildren? Ten, did you say?--Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.--And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the courtimmediately, sir. No, sir, Ill make no order for payment. How dare you,sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworkingindustrious man! I dismiss the case.And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and inthe third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her firstquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to thehalls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber,gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a juryin the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of thefirst chargeant upon the property in the matter of the willpropounded and final testamentary disposition IN RE the real andpersonal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased,versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to thesolemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And hesat him there about the hour of five oclock to administer the law of thebrehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden inand for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the highsinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of thetribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and ofthe tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe ofFergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and ofthe tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe ofCaolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve goodmen and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood thatthey should well and truly try and true deliverance make in theissue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner atthe bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them Godand kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, andthey swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would doHis rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth fromtheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended inconsequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and footand would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge againsthim for he was a malefactor.--Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Irelandfilling the country with bugs.So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, tellinghim he neednt trouble about that little matter till the first but if hewould just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy bythis and by that hed do the devil and all.--Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must haverepetition. Thats the whole secret.--Rely on me, says Joe.--Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. Wewant no more strangers in our house.--O, Im sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. Its just thatKeyes, you see.--Consider that done, says Joe.--Very kind of you, says Bloom.--The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. Webrought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxonrobbers here.--Decree NISI, says J. J.And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, aspiders web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowlingafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite andwhen.--A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, thats whats the cause of all ourmisfortunes.--And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the POLICE GAZETTEwith Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.--Give us a squint at her, says I.And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terryborrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts.Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicagocontractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling forher tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just intime to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.--O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!--Theres hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off ofthat one, what?So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with aface on him as long as a late breakfast.--Well, says the citizen, whats the latest from the scene of action? Whatdid those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide aboutthe Irish language?ONolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to thepuissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of thatwhich had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city,second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after dueprayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counselwhereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honouramong mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.--Its on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutalSassenachs and their PATOIS.So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good tillyou heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting yourblind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach anation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration andtheir colonies and their civilisation.--Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! Thecurse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thickluggedsons of whores gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of thename. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons ofbastards ghosts.--The European family, says J. J. ...--Theyre not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Eganof Paris. You wouldnt see a trace of them or their language anywhere inEurope except in a CABINET DAISANCE.And says John Wyse:--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:--CONSPUEZ LES ANGLAIS! PERFIDE ALBION!He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy handsthe medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan LAMHDEARG ABU, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorousheroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as thedeathless gods.--Whats up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that hadlost a bob and found a tanner.--Gold cup, says he.--Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.--THROWAWAY, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the restnowhere.--And Basss mare? says Terry.--Still running, says he. Were all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid onmy tip SCEPTRE for himself and a lady friend.--I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on ZINFANDEL that Mr Flynn gaveme. Lord Howard de Waldens.--Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. THROWAWAY,says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy nameis SCEPTRE.So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there wasanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luckwith his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.--Not there, my child, says he.--Keep your pecker up, says Joe. Shed have won the money only for theother dog.And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloomsticking in an odd word.--Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others eyes but they cantsee the beam in their own.--RAIMEIS, says the citizen. Theres no-one as blind as the fellow thatwont see, if you know what that means. Where are our missingtwenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four,our lost tribes?

Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, MrsClyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, MissVirginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss BlancheMaple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss PriscillaElderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O MimosaSan, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, MissTimidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, MrsGloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and MrsNorma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by theirpresence. The bride who was given away by her father, the MConifer ofthe Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in greenmercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with ayoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhuedfringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acornbronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer,sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, adainty MOTIF of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe andrepeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heronfeathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at theorgan with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribednumbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangementof WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE at the conclusion of the service. Onleaving the church of Saint Fiacre IN HORTO after the papalblessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfireof hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod,hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs WyseConifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.--And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade withSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels werepupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.--And will again, says Joe.--And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says thecitizen, clapping his thigh. our harbours that are empty will be fullagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom ofKerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleetof masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan OReillys and theOKennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty withthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when thefirst Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag tothe fore, none of your Henry Tudors harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a bluefield, the three sons of Milesius.And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss likea tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloodylife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembledmultitude in Shanagolden where he darent show his nose with the MollyMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing theholding of an evicted tenant.--Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?--An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.--Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?--Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir. Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits insteadof attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying tocrack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head downlike a bull at a gate. And another one: BLACK BEAST BURNED IN OMAHA, GA.A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strungup in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they oughtto drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sureof their job.--But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?--Ill tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.Read the revelations thats going on in the papers about flogging on thetraining ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself DISGUSTEDONE.So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crewof tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and theparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young ladbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of agun.--A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir JohnBeresford called it but the modern Gods Englishman calls it caning on thebreech.And says John Wyse:--Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a longcane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor ladtill he yells meila murder.--Thats your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses theearth.The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber onthe face of Gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogsand cottonball barons. Thats the great empire they boast about of drudgesand whipped serfs.--On which the sun never rises, says Joe.--And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. Theunfortunate yahoos believe it.They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose againfrom the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till furtherorders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.--But, says Bloom, isnt discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldntit be the same here if you put force against force?Didnt I tell you? As true as Im drinking this porter if he was at hislast gasp hed try to downface you that dying was living.--Well put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greaterIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in theblack . Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laidlow by the batteringram and the TIMES rubbed its hands and told thewhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland asredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But theSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full ofcrops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, theydrove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in thecoffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the landof bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, thesons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.--Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was ...--We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since thepoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed atKillala.--Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged usagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and thebroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wildgeese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and ODonnell, duke of Tetuan inSpain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to MariaTeresa. But what did we ever get for it?--The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know whatit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Arent they tryingto make an ENTENTE CORDIALE now at Tay Pays dinnerparty with perfidiousAlbion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.--CONSPUEZ LES FRANCAIS, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.--And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, havent we hadenough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George theelector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch thats dead?Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old onewith the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night ofGod, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman cartingher up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskersand singing him old bits of songs about EHREN ON THE RHINE and comewhere the boose is cheaper.--Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.--Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. Theres a bloody sight more poxthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!--And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests andbishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majestysracing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeysrode. The earl of Dublin, no less.--They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.And says J. J.:--Considerations of space influenced their lordships decision.--Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.--Yes, sir, says he. I will.--You? says Joe.--Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.--Repeat that dose, says Joe.Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excitedwith his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rollingabout.--Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.Perpetuating national hatred among nations.--But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.--Yes, says Bloom.--What is it? says John Wyse.--A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the sameplace.--By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if thats so Im a nation for Imliving in the same place for the past five years.So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying tomuck out of it:--Or also living in different places.--That covers my case, says Joe.--What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.--Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.--After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief toswab himself dry.--Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeatafter me the following words.The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irishfacecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach ogMacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefullyproduced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on thelegendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one candistinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to eachof the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a NorthAmerican puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be itsaid in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. Thescenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and rathsand cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones,are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when theSligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long agoin the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney,the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins,Irelands Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery ofMessrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neaghs banks,the vale of Ovoca, Isoldes tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dunshospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynchs castle, the Scotchhouse, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail,Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice,Jurys Hotel, S. Patricks Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth collegerefectory, Curleys hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke ofWellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry StreetWarehouse, Fingals Cave--all these moving scenes are still there for ustoday rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which havepassed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.--Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?--Thats mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.--And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.Also now. This very moment. This very instant.Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.--Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongsto us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold byauction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.--Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.--Im talking about injustice, says Bloom.--Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.Thats an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Oldlardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, hed adorn asweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurses apron on him. Andthen he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, aslimp as a wet rag.--But its no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. Thats notlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that itsthe very opposite of that that is really life.--What? says Alf.--Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says heto John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.If he comes just say Ill be back in a second. Just a moment.Whos hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.--A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.--Well, says John Wyse. Isnt that what were told. Love your neighbour.--That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,moya! Hes a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable Aloves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with theear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in thebrown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves HerMajesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You lovea certain person. And this person loves that other person becauseeverybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.--Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.--Hurrah, there, says Joe.--The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.--We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the womenand children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text GOD IS LOVEpasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit inthe UNITED IRISHMAN today about that Zulu chief thats visiting England?--Whats that? says Joe.So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he startsreading out:--A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presentedyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfeltthanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in hisdominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusionof which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech,freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend AnaniasPraisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup andemphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and theBritish empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearestpossessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of Godand the secret of Englands greatness, graciously presented to him bythe white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personaldedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank alovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast BLACK AND WHITE from theskull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak,surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory ofCottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book, subsequentlyexecuting a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which heswallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girlhands.--Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldnt doubt her. Wonder did he put thatbible to the same use as I would.--Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful landthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.--Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.--No, says the citizen. Its not signed Shanganagh. Its onlyinitialled: P.--And a very good initial too, says Joe.--Thats how its worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.--Well, says J. J., if theyre any worse than those Belgians in the CongoFree State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man whats thishis name is?--Casement, says the citizen. Hes an Irishman.--Yes, thats the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and floggingthe natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out ofthem.--I know where hes gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.--Who? says I.--Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob onTHROWAWAY and hes gone to gather in the shekels.--Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horsein anger in his life?--Thats where hes gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to backthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. Hes the onlyman in Dublin has it. A dark horse.--Hes a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.--Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.--There you are, says Terry.Goodbye Ireland Im going to Gort. So I just went round the back ofthe yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I wasletting off my (THROWAWAY twenty to) letting off my load gob says I tomyself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one inSlatterys off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings isfive quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burkewas telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, musthave done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tubeSHES BETTER or SHES (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with thepool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to thosebloody (theres the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wysesaying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in hispaper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxesoff of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walkabout selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that putsthe bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give usa bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloodymouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before himperpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, thatpoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country withhis baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Anyamount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security.Gob, hes like Lanty MacHales goat thatd go a piece of the road withevery one.--Well, its a fact, says John Wyse. And theres the man now thatll tellyou all about it, Martin Cunningham.Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Powerwith him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of thecollector generals, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registrationand he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at thekings expense.Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from theirpalfreys.--Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.Saucy knave! To us!So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.--Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.--Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.--Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a barelarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.--How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasantcountenance, So servest thou the kings messengers, master Taptun?An instantaneous change overspread the landlords visage.--Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the kingsmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. Thekings friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my houseI warrant me.--Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trenchermanby his aspect. Hast aught to give us?Mine host bowed again as he made answer:--What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops ofvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hogs bacon, a boars headwith pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon ofold Rhenish?--Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!--Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a barelarder, quotha! Tis a merry rogue.So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.--Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.--Isnt that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen aboutBloom and the Sinn Fein?--Thats so, says Martin. Or so they allege.--Who made those allegations? says Alf.--I, says Joe. Im the alligator.--And after all, says John Wyse, why cant a jew love his country like thenext fellow?--Why not? says J. J., when hes quite sure which country it is.--Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hellis he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.--Who is Junius? says J. J.--We dont want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.--Hes a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was hedrew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that inthe castle.--Isnt he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.--Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, thefathers name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the fatherdid.--Thats the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saintsand sages!--Well, theyre still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For thatmatter so are we.--Yes, says J. J., and every male thats born they think it may be theirMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, tillhe knows if hes a father or a mother.--Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.--O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of histhat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying atin of Neaves food six weeks before the wife was delivered.--EN VENTRE SA MERE, says J. J.--Do you call that a man? says the citizen.--I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.--Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.--And who does he suspect? says the citizen.Gob, theres many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixedmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a monthwith headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what Im tellingyou? Itd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that andthrow him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Thensloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like aman. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.--Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We cant wait.--A wolf in sheeps clothing, says the citizen. Thats what he is. Viragfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.--Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.--Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.--You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.--Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate ourshores.--Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is myprayer.--Amen, says the citizen.--And Im sure He will, says Joe.And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes,thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons,the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardiansand monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians andCamaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans,and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi,Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmelmount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa ofAvila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis,capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara:and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent:and the monks of S.

And all came with nimbi andaureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olivecrowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of theirefficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees,bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons,lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles,stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps,stags horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, waxcandles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by NelsonsPillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain streetchanting the introit in EPIPHANIA DOMINI which beginneth SURGE,ILLUMINARE and thereafter most sweetly the gradual OMNES which saithDE SABA VENIENT they did divers wonders such as casting out devils,raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and theblind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpretingand fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneatha canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father OFlynn attended byMalachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointedplace, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, ,  and  littleBritain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fothe sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, thecelebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and thegroynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pedimentsand the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolasand sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that Godmight bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaacand Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. Andentering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of allthe blessed answered his prayers.--ADIUTORIUM NOSTRUM IN NOMINE DOMINI.--QUI FECIT COELUM ET TERRAM.--DOMINUS VOBISCUM.--ET CUM SPIRITU TUO.And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and heprayed and they all with him prayed:--DEUS, CUIUS VERBO SANCTIFICANTUR OMNIA, BENEDICTIONEM TUAM EFFUNDE SUPERCREATURAS ISTAS: ET PRAESTA UT QUISQUIS EIS SECUNDUM LEGEM ET VOLUNTATEMTUAM CUM GRATIARUM ACTIONE USUS FUERIT PER INVOCATIONEM SANCTISSIMINOMINIS TUI CORPORIS SANITATEM ET ANIMAE TUTELAM TE AUCTORE PERCIPIAT PERCHRISTUM DOMINUM NOSTRUM.--And so say all of us, says Jack.--Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.--Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strikewhen be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of ahurry.--I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope Imnot ...--No, says Martin, were ready.Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! Theresa jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred tofive.--Dont tell anyone, says the citizen,--Beg your pardon, says he.--Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.--Dont tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. Its asecret.And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.--Bye bye all, says Martin.And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton orwhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be allat sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.---Off with you, saysMartin to the jarvey.The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poopthe helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forwardwith all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drewnigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noblebark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright whenhe fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof eachone is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring andgiveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contendfor the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, thosewilling nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in acircle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw thecitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with thedropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candlein Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf roundhim like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.--Let me alone, says he.And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and hebawls out of him:--Three cheers for Israel!Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christsake and dont be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, theresalways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder aboutbloody nothing. Gob, itd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martintelling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf andJoe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and theloafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit downon the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eyestarts singing IF THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS A JEW, JEW, JEW and a slutshouts out of her:--Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!And says he:--Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.--He had no father, says Martin. Thatll do now. Drive ahead.--Whose God? says the citizen.--Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jewlike me.Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.--By Jesus, says he, Ill brain that bloody jewman for using the holyname.By Jesus, Ill crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.--Stop! Stop! says Joe.A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances fromthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bidfarewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs AlexanderThoms, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for thedistant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow ofMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great ECLAT wascharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll ofancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to thedistinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of thecommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefullyexecuted in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflectsevery credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob AGUS Jacob. The departing guestwas the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were presentbeing visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up thewellknown strains of COME BACK TO ERIN, followed immediately by RAKOCZSYSMARCH. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the fourseas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf,Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal andSperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeksof M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amidcheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a bigmuster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, themastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floraltribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in largenumbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla ofbarges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped insalute as were also those of the electrical power station at thePigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. VISSZONTLATASRA, KEDVES BARATON!VISSZONTLATASRA! Gone but not forgotten.Gob, the devil wouldnt stop him till he got hold of the bloody tinanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and heshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queens royaltheatre:--Where is he till I murder him?And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.--Bloody wars, says I, Ill be in for the last gospel.But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nags head round theother way and off with him.--Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sunwas in his eyes or hed have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent itinto the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrelafter the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughingand the old tinbox clattering along the street.The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. Theobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifthgrade of Mercallis scale, and there is no record extant of a similarseismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of , theyear of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to havebeen that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inns Quayward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences inthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that nobleedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe importantlegal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneathwhich it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waveswere accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cycloniccharacter. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the muchrespected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silkumbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of armsand house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quartersessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discoveredby search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the formeron the third basaltic ridge of the giants causeway, the latter embeddedto the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopenbay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that theyobserved an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling throughthe atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directedsouthwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are beinghourly received from all parts of the different continents and thesovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that aspecial MISSA PRO DEFUNCTIS shall be celebrated simultaneously bythe ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopaldioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage ofthe souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly calledaway from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of DEBRIS, human remainsetc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son,  GreatBrunswick street, and Messrs T. and C.

Gob, if he got thatlottery ticket on the side of his poll hed remember the gold cup,he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assaultand battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his lifeby furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did.And he let a volley of oaths after him.--Did I kill him, says he, or what?And he shouting to the bloody dog:--After him, Garry! After him, boy!And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and oldsheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with hislugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and theybeheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheldHim in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, havingraiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe theydurst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:ELIJAH! ELIJAH! And He answered with a main cry: ABBA! ADONAI! And theybeheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascendto the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees overDonohoes in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.    * * * * * * *The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysteriousembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of alltoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proudpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, onthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on thequiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness thevoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to thestormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the eveningscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oftwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chatbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey andEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and JackyCaffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps tomatch and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy andJacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiledtwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merryfaces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand withtheir spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing withtheir big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman wasrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that younggentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and ninedays old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp hisfirst babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fatlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.--Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink ofwater.And baby prattled after her:--A jink a jink a jawbo.Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got totake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose andpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrupon. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardmanwas as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None ofyour spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh inher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, agirl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaintlanguage of little brother.But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommyand Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exceptionto this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sandwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrongthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like theMartello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky wasselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishmans houseis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that thewouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castletoo. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew theattention of the girl friends.--Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catchyou for that.His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call fortheir big sisters word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he wastoo after his misadventure. His little man-o-war top and unmentionableswere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothingover lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand wasto be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glisteningwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness andshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was nearhim she wouldnt be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.--Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:--Whats your name? Butter and cream?--Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy yoursweetheart?--Nao, tearful Tommy said.--Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.--Nao, Tommy said.--I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance fromher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommys sweetheart. Gerty isTommys sweetheart.--Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.Cissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whisperedto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where thegentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoes.But who was Gerty?Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost inthought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair aspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She waspronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, shewas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking oflate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welchsfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to getand that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritualin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupidsbow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabasterwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointmentscould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid glovesin bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that onceto Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggersdrawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffsfrom time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not tolet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed neverspeak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was aninnate refinement, a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty whichwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree inher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good educationGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in theland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow andpatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirsto her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent toher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charmfew could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gertys were ofthe bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressivebrows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It wasMadame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the PrincessNovelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave thathaunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, andshe had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically curedand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face butyour nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. ButGertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brownwith a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion ofluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And justnow at Edys words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintestrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlishshyness that of a surety Gods fair land of Ireland did not holdher equal.For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She wasabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclinationprompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lipspouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous littlelaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knewright well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of himcooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel. As perusual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycleoff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of herwindow. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studyinghard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he wasgoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he leftthe high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in thebicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhapsfor what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he mightlearn to love her in time. They were protestants in his familyand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the BlessedVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with anexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, theshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would knowanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle atthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of thosegood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she andthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever becausehe didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary ofDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might beout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because itwas expected in the LADYS PICTORIAL that electric blue would be worn)with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with herfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and anavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim gracefulfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat ofwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesdayweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at lastshe found what she wanted at Clerys summer sales, the very it, slightlyshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. Shedid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then,smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her!And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that thatwould take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were thenewest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was veryPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and neverwould ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle overher higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more ofher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and widegarter tops. As for undies they were Gertys chief care and who that knowsthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty wouldnever see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She hadfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments andnighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons,rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herselfand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed themand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trustthose washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the things.She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her owncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhereon her because the green she wore that day week brought grief becausehis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibitionand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside outand that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things oninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so longas it wasnt of a Friday.And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow isthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worldsto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way totears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough nottoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You arelovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a faceinfinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she hadknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has beenarranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D.(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He wastoo young to understand. He would not believe in love, a womansbirthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoers (he was still inshort trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waistshe went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangelyhusky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the endof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark aboutrefreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been ReggyWylies strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must bea man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leapyear too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal tolay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with astrong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightlyflecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his shelteringarms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate natureand comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her shelongs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sicknessin health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she wasjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself hislittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue inthe face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she wouldbe twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comfortstoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked thatfeeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue andqueen Anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions fromall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in thefine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then creamthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt likethe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often shewondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses andthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures andengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltraps lovely dogGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clerys summer jumble sales like theyhave in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had alwaysadmired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under hiscarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continentfor their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settleddown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning theywould both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own twoselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear littlewifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes sothen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to runoff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommysaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with theball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but Tommy said it washis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if youplease. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little TommyCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off nowwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.--Youre not my sister, naughty Tommy said. Its my ball.But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at herfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand andTommy after it in full career, having won the day.--Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.And she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heresthe lord mayor, heres his two horses, heres his gingerbread carriageand here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edygot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that fromeveryone always petting him.--Id like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I wont say.--On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissysaying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of herlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was surethe gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.--Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as Id look at him.Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at hersometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some moreChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mensfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when shewanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit tothe Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forgether the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burnedcork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself,one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of yourtwofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and thepealing anthem of the organ. It was the mens temperance retreat conductedby the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon andbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gatheredtogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifyingspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet ofthe immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto,beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words,holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gertys ears!Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, bytaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in PearsonsWeekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over andover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brownstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rustybucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearthsand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had evenwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance andhad seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forgethimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gertyknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way ofkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard hercompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman offSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so likehimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw himany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for afather because he was too old or something or on account of his face (itwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimpleson it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father!With all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME, MARY, HOW TOWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cocklesand lettuce with Lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang THEMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, Godhave mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mothers birthday that was andCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest ofhis days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout andshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from hisoffice about Catesbys cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for apalace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house,a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was itrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didnt likeher mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thingthey ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of herfor her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main everynight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where shenever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocerschristmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman inthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering abunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her latticewindow. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were donesomething lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitudeand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certainpurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers withthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrapabout the halcyon days what they meant.The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till atlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no gettingbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could downtowards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow tovoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting thereby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our twochampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid troubleCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. Thegentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strandtowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right underGertys skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured againfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt comerolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissylaughed.--If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into herpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted herskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jollygood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towardsthe shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attentionon account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, adanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into hercheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual butnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the facethat met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemedto her the saddest she had ever seen.Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted andwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain oforiginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray forus, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And carewornhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erredand wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright withhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the greatsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virginsintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those whoimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles ofchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played withbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peepshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissygone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,didnt the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.--Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent foreleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health,a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to besomething great, they said.--Haja ja ja haja.Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to situp properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out,holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanketthe other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was mostobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:--Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all nouse soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about thegeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave himin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen wasquickly appeased.Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out ofthat and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little bratsof twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintingsthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and sucha pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and theclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music likethat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like akind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was herhe was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned intoher as though they would search her through and through, read her verysoul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trustthem? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and hispale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo shehad of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which shepreferred because she wasnt stagestruck like Winny Rippingham thatwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but shecould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE fromwhere he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and thestory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have givenworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, andhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel bucklesof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockingsthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that ofwhich she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joyon her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that hewas like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, herdreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he hadsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had beenhimself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestantor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. Therewere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly womannot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclistsshowing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all, toforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forgetthe memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like areal man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie,for herself alone.Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. ORA PRO NOBIS. Wellhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy cannever be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for theafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glasswindows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of theblessed Virgins sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon OHanlon atthe altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He lookedalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark andhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nunin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novenaof Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that inconfession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we wereall subject to natures laws, he said, in this life and that that was nosin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it doneunto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroideredfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock shenoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came outof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about theflowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know whatsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views ofDublin or some place.The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jackythrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Littlemonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give thema good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both ofthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because theywere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.--Jacky! Tommy!Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the verylast time shed ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and sheran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a goodenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerryshe was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because itwasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ranwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt atthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboyabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thoughtshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runnershe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoatrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would haveserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentallyon purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her looktall and got a fine tumble. TABLEAU! That would have been a very charmingexpose for a gentleman like that to witness.Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handedthe thurible to Canon OHanlon and he put in the incense and censed theBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she wasitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt becauseshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake inall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he nevertook his eyes off of her and then Canon OHanlon handed the thuribleback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacramentand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her footin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSACRAMEN TUM. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrowsof Georges street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and therewasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form(the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the differencefor himself.Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball withher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streeltugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only afortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanginglike a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle herhair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen ona girls shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening inits sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you founda head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answeringflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim andswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught theexpression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Herwomans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at thethought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colourof her face became a glorious rose.Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse thebaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was whyno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern ofhers. And she said to Gerty:--A penny for your thoughts.--What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.I was only wondering was it late.Because she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave agentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her thetime and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissingtime, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told tobe in early.--Wait, said Cissy, Ill run ask my uncle Peter over there whats the timeby his conundrum.So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take hishand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with hiswatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he wasGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment hehad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and thenext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressedin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was theright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to itand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry hiswatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sunwas set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke inmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle saidhis waterworks were out of order.Then they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and CanonOHanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down andhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fireto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and shecould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works andshe swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but hecould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch orwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands backinto his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her andshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her staysthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when sheclipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselveson her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at hershrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionategaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face. It is for you,Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gertynoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect becauseit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push upthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair tomake herself attractive of course and Canon OHanlon stood up with hiscope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to readoff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy weretalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could paythem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politenesswhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing herover. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes thatspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt--O yes, it cut deep becauseEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would woundlike the confounded little cat she was. Gertys lips parted swiftly toframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat,so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artistmight have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew.Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would neverunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wasin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back insympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.--O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud headflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because its leap year.Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of theringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her youngvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could justchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would shecast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcardinto a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume shecould give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edys countenance fell tono slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black asthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, thelittle kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousyand they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere,that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody elsetoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipeand smoke it.Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissytucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time toobecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. AndCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to godeedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleefuleyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy andbaby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to alland sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.--O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.The slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rights.Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough andEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it wasflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed itoff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction becausejust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashorebecause Canon OHanlon was up on the altar with the veil that FatherConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the BlessedSacrament in his hands.How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse ofErin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a batflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with atiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses sopicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it waseasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going hisrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shadyTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near herwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in thatbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins, author of MABEL VAUGHAN andother tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved toread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovelyconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in shelaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not erron the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was thereshe kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, herchild of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, heralabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things camehome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts writtenin it in violet ink that she bought in Helys of Dame Street forshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only expressherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. ARTTHOU REAL, MY IDEAL? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, andafter there was something about TWILIGHT, WILT THOU EVER? and ofttimesthe beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had mistedher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slippingby for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew sheneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkeyhill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt.If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holdingback for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the greatsacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer thanthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he amarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like thenobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her putinto a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if--what then? Would itmake a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate herfinebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person,the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that wentwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honour,degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: notthat. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sisterwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a bigess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the daysbeyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understandhim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waitingwith little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heartof mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heartthat told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the worldfor her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come whatmight she would be wild, untrammelled, free.Canon OHanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacleand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES andthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over andFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasntshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:--O, look, Cissy!And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too overthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.--Its fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and thechurch, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it andCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall running.--Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. Its the bazaar fireworks.But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck andcall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she couldsee from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her sether pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passionsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were leftalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew hecould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man ofinflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were workingand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up wherethe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as notto fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him andher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that,supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the pantingof his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passionof men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in deadsecret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that wasstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had picturescut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said heused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes inthe bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feelhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of hishandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didntdo the other thing before being married and there ought to bewomen priests that would understand without your telling out andCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy lookin her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so madabout actors photographs and besides it was on account of that otherthing coming on the way it did.And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned backand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and theyall saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leanedback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flyingthrough the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Romancandle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush,they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higherand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine,an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin,better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and thenit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling inevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full viewhigh up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wadingand she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest waylike that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealmenthalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemenlooking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to himchokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel hislips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girls love, a littlestrangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Romancandle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! inraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads andthey shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden,O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! Sheglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance ofpiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girlHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What abrute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to himand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned andwandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was theirsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none toknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the eveningto and fro and little bats dont tell.Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to showwhat a great person she was: and then she cried:--Gerty! Gerty! Were going. Come on. We can see from farther up.Gerty had an idea, one of loves little ruses. She slipped a hand intoher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of coursewithout letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if hes too far to.She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again,there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream ofyester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in alast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of astrange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She halfsmiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged ontears, and then they parted.Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand toCissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It wasdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippyseaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her butwith care and very slowly because--because Gerty MacDowell was ...Tight boots? No. Shes lame! O!Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! Thats why shes lefton the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong bythe cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman.But makes them polite. Glad I didnt know it when she was on show. Hotlittle devil all the same. I wouldnt mind.

Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget anappointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because likethemselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friendsat school, arms round each others necks or with ten fingers locked,kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nunswith whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,vindictive too for what they cant get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and writeto me. And Ill write to you. Now wont you?

Glad to get away from other chaps wife. Eating off hiscold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But mighthappen sometime, I dont think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What?Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when its not what theylike. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentlemanwho. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed hismind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, somethinglike that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend towant something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She musthave been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since shecame to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. Thepropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell bytheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till theirdying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wallbeside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed.Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eyeon her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks.Up like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing inmothers clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. Andthe dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she couldwhistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore inJammets wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, tellingme the right time? Ill tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunesand prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing thelittle boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understandbirds, animals, babies. In their line.Didnt look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldnt give thatsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fineeyes she had, clear. Its the white of the eye brings that out not so muchthe pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dogsjump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing apicture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence?Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them siton a bench marked WET PAINT. Eyes all over them. Look under the bedfor whats not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the cornerof Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged atonce he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typistgoing up Roger Greenes stairs two at a time to show her understandings.Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in thebone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror tosave the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a womans eye on amirror. And when I sent her for Mollys Paisley shawl to Prescotts by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking!Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcelstoo. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it,to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from?Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, dont they know! Three yearsold she was in front of Mollys dressingtable, just before we left Lombardstreet west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of theworld. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf.Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frumptoday. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow!Beef to the heel.A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zradsand zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to seeand Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of therocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.Lord!Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernans, Dignams. Forthis relief much thanks. In HAMLET, that is. Lord! It was all thingscombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of mytongue. Your head it simply swirls. Hes right. Might have made a worsefool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tellyou all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldnt be? No,Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my name and theaddress Dolphins barn a blind.    HER MAIDEN NAME WAS JEMINA BROWN    AND SHE LIVED WITH HER MOTHER IN IRISHTOWN.Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if itunderstood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throwanything straight at school. Crooked as a rams horn. Sad however becauseit lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papaspants will soon fit Willy and fullers earth for the baby when they holdhim out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harmsway. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Childrens handsalways round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first,sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtnt to have giventhat child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy,Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still.She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.That young doctor OHare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breenand Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at nightMrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink ofpub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark,whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk lastnight? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens comehome to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe thewomens fault also. Thats where Molly can knock spots off them. Its theblood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for theopulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home,skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you outsome kind of a nondescript, wouldnt know what to call her. Always see afellows weak point in his wife. Still theres destiny in it, falling inlove. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogsif some woman didnt take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them hematched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makesone. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May andrepent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskinis not back. Better detach.Ow!Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long andthe short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magneticinfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, Isuppose, at once. Cats away, the mice will play. I remember looking inPill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earthfor instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. Andtime, well thats the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stoppedthe whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because its all arranged.Magnetic needle tells you whats going on in the sun, the stars. Littlepiece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Womanand man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggestand let you see and see more and defy you if youre a man to see that and,like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.Tip. Have to let fly.Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on beforethird person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, herunderjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots andspurs at the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard streetwest. Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did.Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably inthe paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scrapedher slipper on the floor so they wouldnt hear. But lots of them cantkick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a generalall round over me and half down my back.Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. Thats her perfume. Why she waved her hand. Ileave you this to think of me when Im far away on the pillow. What is it?Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. Shed like scent of thatkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At thedance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She waswearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Goodconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose theres some connection. Forinstance if you go into a cellar where its dark. Mysterious thing too.Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slowbut sure. Suppose its ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smellthem leagues off. Tell you what it is. Its like a fine fine veil or webthey have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, andtheyre always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbowcolours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp ofher stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off.Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift onthe bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me ofstrawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpitsor under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners.Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat.Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs ateach other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm.Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.Were the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have theirperiod. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Likewhat? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves longJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink givesthat. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because prieststhat are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like fliesround treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The treeof forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.And its extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of hiswaistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, thats the soap.O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind.Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like thathag this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I couldmention Meaghers just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.Two and nine. Bad opinion of me hell have. Call tomorrow. How much doI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him givingcredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run upa bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets intosomewhere else.Heres this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just wentas far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: hada good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walka mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walkafter him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still youlearn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women dontmock what matter? Thats the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now.THE MYSTERY MAN ON THE BEACH, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom.Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at thegraveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthyperhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be somesomewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp.

Run you through thesmall guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in theshade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. RoygbivVance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.A star I see. Venus? Cant tell yet. Two. When three its night. Werethose nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No.Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the settingsun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land,goodnight.Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on whitefluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his wayup through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore onthe mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position.Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you dont know how niceyou looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at allthat offer. Suppose its the only time we cross legs, seated. Also thelibrary today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But itsthe evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, knowtheir hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers,avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillons garden where I kissedher shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. Junethat was too I wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself.Ye crags and peaks Im with you once again. Life, love, voyage roundyour own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but mustbe on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. Therhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I theplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:thats all. Lovers: yum yum.Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood outof me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once itcomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not thesame.

And just when he and she. Circus horsewalking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doylesovercoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.

Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistakein the valuation when I was in Thoms. Twentyeight it is. Two housesthey have. Gabriel Conroys brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder whythey come out at night like mice. Theyre a mixed breed. Birds arelike hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still.All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of ajar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tinyhands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for examplelike the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants tostamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on thestaircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with threecolours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the CITY ARMSwith the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howtha while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. Thats how that wise man whats hisname with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It cant betourists matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the windand light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in thesun. Archimedes. I have it! My memorys not so bad.Ba. Who knows what theyre always flying for. Insects? That bee last weekgot into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be theone bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what they say.Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly overthe ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamersfloundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. FAUGH A BALLAGH!Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchiefsail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.No ends really because its round. Wife in every port they say. She has agood job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever hedoes. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet theydo. The anchors weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medalon him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no whats this they call it poorpapas father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the landof Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all thosesuperstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hangingon to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him,gulping salt water, and thats the last of his nibs till the sharkscatch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones locker, moon looking down sopeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in searchof funds for Mercers hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster ofviolet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherdshour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving hiseverwelcome double knock, went the nine oclock postman, theglowworms lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurelhedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp atLeahys terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrillvoice went crying, wailing: EVENING TELEGRAPH, STOP PRESS EDITION! RESULTOF THE GOLD CUP RACE! and from the door of Dignams house a boy ran outand called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over thesands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired oflong days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the nightbreeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eyeunsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far onKish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. IrishLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breechesbuoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the ErinsKing, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip.Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed theherrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly,no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Dont know what deathis at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear.When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didnt want to. Mamma! Mamma!Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them upin the air to catch them. Ill murder you. Is it only half fun?Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns ateach other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfireand nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting betterasleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love?Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little handit was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when youtouch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays Iremember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left oneis more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Paddingthemselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling,wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood.Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. OHaras tower. The seabirdsscreaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown,gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea shetold me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought Idmarry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. BUENASNOCHES, SENORITA. EL HOMBRE AMA LA MUCHACHA HERMOSA. Why me? Becauseyou were so foreign from the others.Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes youdull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home.

Martha, the bath, funeral, house ofKeyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus song. Then that bawler inBarney Kiernans. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said abouthis God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home andlaugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to bealone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round.Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel.Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in hermouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste asMorris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignams put the boots on it.Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow shewants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strangename. Takes it for granted were going to pop off first. That widowon Monday was it outside Cramers that looked at me.

Poor man OConnor wife and fivechildren poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some goodmatronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platterface and a large apron.

Must nail that ad of Keyess. Work Hynes andCrawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. Whatsthat? Might be money.Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. Hebrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Cant read. Better go.Better. Im tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes andpebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle withstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Childrenalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters.Whats this? Bit of stick.O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she comehere tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back.Murderers do.

Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror,breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O,those transparent! Besides they dont know.

Of Israels folk was that man that on earth wandering far hadfared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teemingmothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale soGods angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters inward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moonsthrice an hundred.

Christsrood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare underher thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Hornes house.Loth to irk in Hornes hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stowhe ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over landand seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithemeeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved withgood ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so youngthen had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his wordwinning.As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if OHare Doctortidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered thatOHare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that himso heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death forfriend so young, algate sore unwilling Gods rightwiseness to withsay. Shesaid that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness withmasspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick mens oil to his limbs. Theman then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was diedand the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island throughbellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God theAllruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sadwords, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhopesorrowing one with other.Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and thedust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came nakedforth from his mothers womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for togo as he came.The man that was come in to the house then spoke to thenursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay therein childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that womanwas in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unnethto bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that shehad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was thatwomans birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew theman that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to herwords for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have ofmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face forany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Ninetwelve bloodflows chiding her childless.And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and therenighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And therecame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that theyhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where thislearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healedfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible anddreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve ofvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now thathe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that werethere. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither forhe was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller hadsaid thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight wouldnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious tohis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the travellerLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore oflimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood ofFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but theydurst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightfulswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons outof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags thatthere abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought bymagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breaththat he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and richwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And therewas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which laystrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And thesefishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land becauseof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they makea compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid ofcertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously liketo a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwinethemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales ofthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halpthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childeLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat inamity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by andanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and hisneighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with themfor to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them atthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing forthere was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry thatit was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be notcome or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw afranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than anyof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the oneemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty andhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And thefranklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fullydelectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths healthfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopoldthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall andthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandlyhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the worldone that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup. Womans woe with wonder pondering.Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to bedrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side theboard, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciables withother his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklinthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and youngStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board andCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of himerewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the mostdrunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sirLeopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had brokehis avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendshipto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languorbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feastedhim for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love ledon with will to wander, loth to leave.For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns eachgen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintainingthat put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen outa matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Hornes house thatnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before herdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And theysaid farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, thewoman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of thisimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscienceto let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubtthat the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeitthe mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges didprovide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but all criedwith one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and thebabe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what withargument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompteach when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she wasdead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and fora vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband wouldnot let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom youngStephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among layfolk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbogloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibledsouls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the HolyGhost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lustis brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wisthe what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he couldhave of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she wereor wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of hisspleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang youngMalachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millenniumhe cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward withtheir jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and severalby saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any mannerof thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all rightjocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laughtoo open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray andalso for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast himout of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bignesswrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth tomouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reekof moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with,EFFECTU SECUTO, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions ofAverroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the secondmonth a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldethever souls for Gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which wasbut a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeththe fishermans seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy churchfor all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would hein like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he saiddissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had everloved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with hisexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Churchbelike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly hescaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err,a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man andhe averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for hewas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in thattaking it appeared eftsoons.But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he stillhad pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labourand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an onlymanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of artcould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart forthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambswool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lieakeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now SirLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him hisfriends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for allaccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure foryoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels andmurdered his goods with whores.About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood emptyso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed theirapproach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for theintentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicarof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he,of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my bodybut my souls bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live bybread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort morethan the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glisteringcoins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteenshilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all admiredto see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. Hiswords were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, times ruinsbuild eternitys mansions. What means this? Desires wind blasts thethorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon therood of time. Mark me now. In womans womb word is made flesh but in thespirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall notpass away. This is the postcreation. OMNIS CARO AD TE VENIET. No questionbut her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable andBernardus saith aptly that She hath an OMNIPOTENTIAM DEIPARAE SUPPLICEM,that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eveand she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam,which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcordssold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But hereis the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was butcreature of her creature, VERGINE MADRE, FIGLIA DI TUO FIGLIO, or sheknew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy withPeter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Josephthe joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, PARCEQUEM. LEO TAXIL NOUS A DIT QUE QUI LAVAIT MISE DANS CETTE FICHUE POSITIONCETAIT LE SACRE PIGEON, VENTRE DE DIEU! ENTWEDER transubstantiality ODERconsubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried outupon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said,a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand,withsay.Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board andwould sing a bawdy catch STABOO STABELLA about a wench that was put inpod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways nowattack: THE FIRST THREE MONTHS SHE WAS NOT WELL, STABOO, whenhere nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye shouldshame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind wasto have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealousthat no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was anancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habitdun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative wantof it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraidedand they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him withmenace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrainseize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thougot in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel,thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool outof that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for hiscognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also thetimes occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.In Hornes house rest should reign.To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary inEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why hehad not cided to take friars vows and he answered him obedience in thewomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. MasterLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds andhow, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of aconfiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowedit too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said veryentirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternalson and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and theyrehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing anddeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, sheto be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, withburning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyriesand the anthem UT NOVETUR SEXUS OMNIS CORPORIS MYSTERIUM till she wasthere unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by thosedelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that isin their MAIDS TRAGEDY that was writ for a like twining of lovers: TOBED, TO BED was the burden of it to be played with accompanableconcent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame ofmost mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferousflambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal prosceniumof connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for,by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen saidindeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them andshe of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran veryhigh in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greaterlove than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for hisfriend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saithZarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the universityof Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was morebeholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilthave the secondbest bed. ORATE, FRATRES, PRO MEMETIPSO. And all the peopleshall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, howthou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger tomy gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick likeJeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me,thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forgetme not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination before me thatthou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to theRoman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lieluxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, evenfrom Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns ofHatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled mewith a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. Andthou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: andwith a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity ofthe interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by thewit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient fromon high Which brake hells gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics)and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion.The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypts plague which in thenights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper UBI andQUOMODO. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in somemean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that samemultiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishingby a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towardsthe final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolarbeing. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip,clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved fromwaters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at lastthe cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamationof the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicityof his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered norwhether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when wewould backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of ourwhoness hath fetched his whenceness.Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly ETIENNE CHANSON but heloudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majesticlongstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepieorder, a penny for him who finds the pea.    BEHOLD THE MANSION REARED BY DEDAL JACK    SEE THE MALT STORED IN MANY A REFLUENT SACK,    IN THE PROUD CIRQUE OF JACKJOHNS BIVOUAC.A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud onleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now thestorm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to floutand witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they mightall mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haughtuplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook withinthe cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then didsome mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yalewhich Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a wordand a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that anold Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he wouldnot lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowedhe crouched in Hornes hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up aheart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavensso that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribsupon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggarts side, spoke tohim calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was noother thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid fromthe thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of anatural phenomenon.But was young Boasthards fear vanquished by Calmers words? No,for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by wordsbe done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like theother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. Butcould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth thebottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was notthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the godBringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why,he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding(which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in theland of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was likethe rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the restand pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he makemore shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon hascommanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that otherland which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise whichbehoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is nodeath and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come asmany as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste hadpointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in witha certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, isBird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path byher flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn asidehither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him soflatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bushor, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manseof Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whoreBird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and awicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her andknow her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else butnotion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot andin it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these wordsprinted on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheekby Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monstersthey cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stoutshield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neitherfrom Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this sameshield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blindfancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr FalseFranklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voiceof the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lifthis arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings doneby them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.

In sum aninfinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase theharvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for aprognostication of Malachis almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has donea prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for hisfarmers gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetchwithout bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they arefound in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how theletter was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him(for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but onStephens persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near bywhich he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went fora merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh orhot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes andfor the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns withcrimps, ostlers, bookies, Pauls men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers,ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceablecatchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he pickedup between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at aboilingcooks and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victualsor a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could alwaysbring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk orwhatnot that every mothers son of them would burst their sides.The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetryor a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), tis allabout Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef,a pox on it. Theres as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it andvery friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by whichhe had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeedthe chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. MORT AUX VACHES, saysFrank then in the French language that had been indentured to abrandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like agentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that hisfather, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn hisletters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to studythe mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt andwas more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with hisvolumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher,then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then hewas for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linenor choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cathas lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father theheadborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, saysMr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift ofit, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morninggoing to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe tis so bad,says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary forMr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stockand meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Lows yard in Prussia street.I question with you there, says he. More like tis the hoose orthe timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomelytold him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperorschief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that wassending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in allMuscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull bythe horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. Hell find himselfon the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats Irish, says he.Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the alepurling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, saysMr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmerNicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emeraldring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table,and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlierbull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils sothat the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins,followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmerNicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctorswho were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all mycousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmers blessing, andwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and theblessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him atrick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his earin the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holytongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the fourfields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him,says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle andruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all overwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of theroad with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the marketso that he could doss and dung to his hearts content. By this timethe father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown soheavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which ourcozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlapsand as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uartersto show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bullslanguage and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was hethat he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass forhimself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a boardput up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice,saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowingas much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed runamok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whateverwas planted and all by lord Harrys orders. There was bad blood betweenthem at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmerNicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster thatkept seven trulls in his house and Ill meddle in his matters,says he. Ill make that animal smell hell, says he, with the helpof that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says MrDixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinnerafter winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first ruleof the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks)he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on pickingup a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sureenough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bullof the Romans, BOS BOVUM, which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head intoa cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers andpulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the waterrunning off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that hadbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bullslanguage to study but he could never learn a word of it except the firstpersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if everhe went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it uponwhat took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon asfast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and theend was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as theungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselvesand their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, mannedthe yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind,put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ranup the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushedoff in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswainof that rollicking chanty:  --POPE PETERS BUT A PISSABED.    MANS A MAN FOR A THAT.Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorwayas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friendwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or acornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civilenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with aproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which hehad had printed that day at Mr Quinnells bearing a legend printed in fairitalics: MR MALACHI MULLIGAN. FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR. LAMBAY ISLAND. Hisproject, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idlepleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sirMilksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task forwhich our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, goodmy friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, beseated, both. Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted ofthe invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that hehad been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibitionin its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of thebalance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defectscongenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, hesaid, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and toreflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to thevilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenialcloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountablemuskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing theinestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows wereat hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worthand inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in feesimple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder,lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with ourascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farmto be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion ofEgypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of anyfemale of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him withthe desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was noobject, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorestkitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be theirconstructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions,would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he wouldfeed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade ofmace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which hedelivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put offfrom his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, itseems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pacehad taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligans smallclothes of ahodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile wasvery favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies fromall though Mr Dixon of Marys excepted to it, asking with a finicking airdid he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however madecourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, asit dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support ofhis contention: TALIS AC TANTA DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI, O QUIRITES, UTMATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI TITILLATIONESTESTIBUS PONDEROSIS ATQUE EXCELSIS ERECTIONIBUS CENTURIONUM ROMANORUMMAGNOPERE ANTEPONUNT, while for those of ruder wit he drove home hispoint by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach,the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a properman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress withanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmosphericswhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he hadadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at apassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell ithis nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked forwhom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made hima civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professionalassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily,though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was comethere about a lady, now an inmate of Hornes house, that was in aninteresting condition, poor body, from womans woe (and here he fetcheda deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether hisincipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened anovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with anadmirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of hersex though tis pity shes a trollop): Theres a belly that never bore abastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirthand threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. Thespry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larumin the antechamber.Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a littlefume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion withthe young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point,having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to passhim a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of thehead (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture)to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle askedthe narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him witha cup of it. MAIS BIEN SUR, noble stranger, said he cheerily, ET MILLECOMPLIMENTS. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothingbut this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but acrust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I wouldaccept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground andgive thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by theGiver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening hisbosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picturewhich he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazingupon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, hadyou but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with herdainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she toldme prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, pon myconscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature todeliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the fieldfor ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee,as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable acreature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence tothese words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eyeand sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures,how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which canhold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polishedcoxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband ofmaturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled andimperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloakalong! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured sevenshowers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, hecried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,thousand thunders, I know of a MARCHAND DE CAPOTES, Monsieur Poyntz,from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion asever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in,my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have justcracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits of the town),is my authority that in Cape Horn, VENTRE BICHE, they have a rain that willwet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, hetells me, SANS BLAGUE, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnestposthaste to another world. Pooh! A LIVRE! cries Monsieur Lynch. Theclumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than afairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit wouldwear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a delugebefore ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as shereminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though therewas none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by thedivine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become ahousehold word that IL Y A DEUX CHOSES for which the innocence of ouroriginal garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is thefittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my prettyphilosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gentlytipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is abath ... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short adiscourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store ofknowledge.Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and,while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan enteredand, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retiredwith a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a momentamong a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality ofmodesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallieseven of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreakof ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. Amonstrous fine bit of cowflesh! Ill be sworn she has rendezvoused you.What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gads bud, immensely so, saidMr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.Demme, does not Doctor OGargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. AsI look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there anytime these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood inthe primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodestsquirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me,Im all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, youre as bad as dear little FatherCantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, criedCostello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady whats got a whiteswelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, roseand begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just theninformed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence hadbeen pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was ENCEINTEwhich she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to abouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit toenliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, savingthe reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon theearth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud ofwitnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far frombeing a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. Icannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable MissCallan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? Andat an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where theseeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence isrendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himselfof this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the lowsoaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected norwould he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged histransgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a roundhand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stapmy vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costellowhich I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy motherthat had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see whatI always looks back on with a loving heart.To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been consciousof some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being thefruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrownchildren: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultlyunderstood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous MOTS weresuch that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible ofthe proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in theirbehalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for himfor he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of amisshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookbacktoothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeons pliersin his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of thatmissing link of creations chain desiderated by the late ingenious MrDarwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted yearsthat he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, beingof a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined hisheart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them withthe readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferancewhich base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and buttolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of femininedelicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he wouldconcede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a properbreeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more,there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency tobeat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel withmettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or thegruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writerexpresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as topretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewomanwhen she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from thesisters words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, itmust be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue soauspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to themercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, toexpress his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance toexpress one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid geniusnot to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinementsince she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy youngblade said it was her husbands that put her in that expectation or at leastit ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you,said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant commentof emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly manwith dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word ofWilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness forthat the event would burst anon. Slife, Ill be round with you. I cannot butextol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another childout of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though thesame young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugialhad been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or anitinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communedthe guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosispossessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatreshould be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition ofacademic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votariesof levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywiseeminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap torelieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have morethan once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, hasthis alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civicrights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Whereis now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During therecent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with hisgranados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge hispiece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled forthe security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets allbenefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has becomeat last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his onlyenjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectablelady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflectionsupon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highlyhis interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has beentoo long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen tohis objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did notscruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse witha female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had thehussys scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her ashard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands hispeevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffes hearing brought upon himfrom an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms asstraightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach thatgospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want ofthe ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and anopprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead innostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generationof unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrinesthat now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets whichdecorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beautymay console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this newexponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which,when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant inbalm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost theirquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acidand inoperative.The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling theceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian tothe junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to thedelegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to thewomens apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth inthe presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the membersof the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation thedelegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hopingthat the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneousabsence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at onceinto a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heardendeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitiousfor the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of unionamong tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successivelyeviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesareansection, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, withrespect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder andrendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe whichsecured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogenitureand kings bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages andinfanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac FOETUS IN FOETU andaprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen(cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion ofthe maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear couldhear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, theprolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressureon the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplifiedin the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificialinsemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequentupon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in thecase of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner ofdelivery called by the Brandenburghers STURZGEBURT, the recorded instancesof multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during thecatamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases ofhuman nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece withchromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics andforensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the mostpopular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravidwoman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcordshould strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of ayearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand againstthat part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat ofcastigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits,negros inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as aPRIMA FACIE and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (thecase of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infantsoccasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by theCaledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land hestood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development atsome stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustainedagainst both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, thetheory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authoritybeing his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaurwhich the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in thepages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words wasimmediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked byan allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry whichnone better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest objectof desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argumenthaving arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynchregarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of oneSiamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent wasreferred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr CoadjutorDeacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show bypreternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he wasinvested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, assome thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man toput asunder what God has joined.But Malachias tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up thescene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and inthe recess appeared ... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other aphial marked POISON. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted onall faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipatedsome such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which,it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer ofSamuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrorsfor me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way wouldI be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin thiswhile back with my share of songs and himself after me the like ofa soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Irelands, is in this life.It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting,the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to hislips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my onlyhope ... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenlyvanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appearedin the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station atten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of thedissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring:The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: LEX TALIONIS. Thesentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immensedebtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His realname was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his ownfather. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. Thelonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. Thespider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from hishole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderers ground.What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of thechameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with themerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as hermood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cudof reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modestsubstance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is youngLeopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror(hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen,precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house inClanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise,and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mothers thought. Or it is thesame figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was aday!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm,equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only),his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and aquiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoningit out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (butthe heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, morethan these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfallmany a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacobs pipe afterlike labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, isaheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from theEurope of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on andthe young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within themist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of adrizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all fora bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of thewatch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie!Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: firstnight, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willerwith the willed, and in an instant (FIAT!) light shall flood the world. Didheart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath twas done but--hold!Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear thesunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not.That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain.No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, whatLeopold was for Rudolph.The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is theinfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions ofcycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight everdescends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk,scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainlysteps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet mouldedin prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonousneck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds theycome, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark!Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings ofwhose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and ofBabylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea,LACUS MORTIS. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing uponthe clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, thelionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant andpachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horriblegulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portentgrows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heavens ownmagnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonderof metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of thedaystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she nowarise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do youcall it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh andloose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustainedon currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simplyswirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, aftera myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangledsign upon the forehead of Taurus.Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been atschool together in Conmees time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of thepast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call theminto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop tomy call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriendingbard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hairwith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and thoseleaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when somethingmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call yourgenius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desireto see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim youStephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear.He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young mans facegrew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of hispromise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feasthad not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost fivedrachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the riders name: Lenehan as muchmore. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, themare ran out freshly with . Madden up. She was leading the field. Allhearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved herscarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run homewhen all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached,outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes weresad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her andbrought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplumswhich she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, saidLenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider islike him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory ina hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall webehold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you rememberher, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincentsaid. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fairbeside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know theright name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the airdrooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In thesunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of thosebuns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his boothnear the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which Iheld her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. Aweek ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free,blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Madromp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And inyour ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevierbook with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe tokeep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion,feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwoodclung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed sheglanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he hadbeen kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind,Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Basss mare perhaps this draughtof his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upona winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to thestranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preservea druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to beawakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, maybe a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not thinkit, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previousexistence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. Thelords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload fromplanet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles andthese were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the secondconstellation.However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about himbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was.entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not thecase at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was goingon were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation wasas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjecturedthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrongshop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hardat a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co atBurton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of othersright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated toattract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He wassimply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best knownto himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings, after the moment befores observations about boyhooddays and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions ofhis own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babeunborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon asit began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to helphimself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himselfand so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glassrecipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time,however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upsetany of the beer that was in it about the place.The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome ofthe course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. Thedebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on theloftiest and most vital. The high hall of Hornes house had never beheld anassembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of thatestablishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scenein truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in hisstriking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mullof Galloway. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance borealready the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next theScotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at hisside was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of theresident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of itthe figure of Bannon in explorers kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhidebrogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbredmanners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of theboard was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere ofSocratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated theflippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilantwanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire ofan indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lureor peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of thatvoluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned forages yet to come.It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus (Div. Scep.) contentions wouldappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to acceptedscientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals withtangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has toface hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best hecan. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannotanswer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb.Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the viewof Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period,assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too longneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, asmost embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani,Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? Thiswould be tantamount to a cooperation (one of natures favourite devices)between the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the nemasperm on the one hand and on theother a happily chosen position, SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element. Theother problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infantmortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are allborn in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan(Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which ourgreylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. byinhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and therevolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters,religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors,exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals,paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, wereaccountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all thegraces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy,instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues suchas Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all theselittle attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition topass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers(Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in thecase of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and tomarital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect,private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants,the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime ofinfanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) isundoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting tocount the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder isthat so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all thingsconsidered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulknature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by MrV. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all otherphenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, bloodtemperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in natures vastworkshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of oneof the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a lawof numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward questionwhy a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child andproperly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (thoughother children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poetswords, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good andcogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths aredue to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbousgerms have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusivelyshown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend todisappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangementwhich, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably thematernal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial tothe race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.Mr S. Dedalus (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparentlypass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability suchmultifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition,corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians andchlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation ofstaggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury lightthe tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are notso intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as thismorbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweeningbumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from analkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggeringbob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies thecookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In arecent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which tookplace in the commons hall of the National Maternity Hospital, ,  and Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw.,F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported byeyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag(an esthetes allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated andmarvellous of all natures processes--the act of sexual congress) she mustlet it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At therisk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the lesseffective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought abouta happy ACCOUCHEMENT. It had been a weary weary while both for patientand doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave womanhad manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now shewas very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, arehappy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverentlylook at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, thatlonging hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the firstbloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to Oneabove, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe shewishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her toshare her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of Gods clay, the fruit of theirlawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a triflestooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity hascome to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, CollegeGreen branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it maynever be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of herpretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mistof years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about thebedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he hadlived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa,darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war,lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of theirunion, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Younghopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential thirdcousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancers office, DublinCastle. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No,let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knockthe ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfewrings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby youread in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquilheart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You toohave fought the good fight and played loyally your mans part. Sir, to youmy hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evilmemories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heartbut they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, letthem be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that theywere not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forthsuddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most variouscircumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe hissenses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, atmidnight, when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will thevision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cuthim off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past,silent, remote, reproachful.The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession ofthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick,upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, aFLAIR, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in theobservers memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural ahomeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought)with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft Mayevening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple andwhite, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interestin the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop,one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urnwhere the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another asfragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know notwhat of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely braceof them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin sodaintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey(blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long thebowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by thatcircle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man doesnow with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needsglance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTAgiving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or ofreproach (ALLES VERGANGLICHE) in her glad look.Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter thatantechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather,befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and ofangels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before thelightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess ofmoisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky inone vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen andblighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives theircentres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours itstorrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent andinstantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.Burkes! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag andbobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctualBloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos,Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.

Nurse Callan taken aback in thehallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs withnews of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark himon. The door! It is open? Ha!

We are not in a beargardennor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is aninfant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and isnow trying to turn an honest penny.

He has recently escaped from Dr Eustaces privateasylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy ispresent, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have beendiscovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronicexhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald fromselfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and hasmetal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily losthis memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning.

His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have foundhim a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole,coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a reallybeautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of theReformed Priests Protection Society which clears up everything. He ispractically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a strawlitter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocers peas. He wearsa hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourgeshimself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclassmisdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was avery posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the mostsacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak.

A WHITE LAMBKIN PEEPS OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET.)    -- III --Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulkof the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked himup generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.His (Stephens) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but abit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink MrBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry wateravailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon anexpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabmansshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridgewhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk andsoda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he wasrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him totake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means duringwhich Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather palein the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyanceof some description which would answer in their then condition, both ofthem being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there wassuch a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few such preliminaries asbrushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddyhandkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they bothwalked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as thefarriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at thecorner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thencedebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergins. But ashe confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hireanywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by somefellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was nosymptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who wasanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting akind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it,evidently there was nothing for it but.put a good face on the matter and footit which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mulletts and theSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in thedirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicappedby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to varythe timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, enteringthoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of themischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as ithappened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recentvisitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the emptyvehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a DublinUnited Tramways Companys sandstrewer happened to be returning andthe elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the incident his owntruly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the mainentrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point forBelfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour andpassing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to saygruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the DockTavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for itsC division police station. Between this point and the high at present unlitwarehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,associated with Bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in Talbotplace, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his fidusAchates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourkes citybakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odourindeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary andmost indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me whereis fancy bread, at Rourkes the bakers it is said.En route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yetperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in completepossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spokea word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swellmobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as ahabitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for youngfellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits underthe influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for everycontingencyas even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick ifyou didnt look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene ofCorny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that manin the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that hemight have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, thebridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, hebeing the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony whichsimply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason hementioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordiallydisliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, asMr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassilstreet, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spotwhen wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being theywere paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on wasequipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to gooff at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civiliansshould by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away yourtime, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besideswhich, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ranaway with a lot of l s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was*******************~~who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question ofstimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably agood burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond acertain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to troubleall round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of otherspractically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephenby all his pubhunting confreres but one, a most glaring piece of ratting onthe part of his brother medicos under all the circs.--And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothingwhatsoever of any kind.Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across theback of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where abrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like oneattracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stoppedfor no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by thelight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure ofthe corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began toremember that this had happened or had been mentioned as havinghappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered thathe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers, Gumley. Toavoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.--Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the archessaluted again, calling:--Night!Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return thecompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuchas he always believed in minding his own business moved off butnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety thoughnot funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew thatit was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothingto live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceablepedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outsidethe city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment categorythey might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decampwith whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice,your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged andgarrotted.Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corleys breathredolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him and hisgenealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of inspectorCorley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certainKatherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfatherPatrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publicanthere whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it(though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbotde Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence ofits kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, awoman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction ofbeing in service in the washkitchen. This therefore was the reason why thestill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressedStephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord JohnCorley.Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.Not as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings. His friends hadall deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him toStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of otheruncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen totell him where on Gods earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that wasfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through themother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if thewhole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow hewas all in.--I wouldnt ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knowsIm on the rocks.--Therell be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boysschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You maymention my name.--Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldnt teach in a school, man. I wasnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck twicein the junior at the christian brothers.--I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something todo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart offthe street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloneys,but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but MConachie toldhim you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavernstreet (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friarBacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadnt said a word about it.Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near itstill Stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew thatCorleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deservingof much credence. However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere discoetcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he gotpaid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which wasthe date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of thewherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing wouldget it out of Corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thingto do but hand out the needful. Whereas. He put his hand in a pocketanyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he mightlend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at allevents and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, tohis chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all theresult of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the momentwhether he had lost as well he might have or left because in thatcontingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. Hewas altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he triedto recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gavethem he wondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pockethe came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneouslyhowever, as it turned out.--Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lenthim one of them.--Thanks, Corley answered, youre a gentleman. Ill pay you back onetime. Whos that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse inCamden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good wordfor us to get me taken on there. Id carry a sandwichboard only the girl inthe office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks, man. God, youveto book ahead, man, youd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I dont give ashite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two andsix he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of BagsComisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullams, theshipchandlers, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Naglesback with OMara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunkand disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of thecobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporationwatchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, washaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own privateaccount while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now andthen at Stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if hehad seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in aposition to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being alevelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewdobservation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchywearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably hewas one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a questionof one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to putit, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chancedto be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a finewould be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummateamount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night ormorning. Pretty thick that was certainly.The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, withhis practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to theblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,laughingly, Stephen, that is:--He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody namedBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, MrBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in thedirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,whereupon he observed evasively:--Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention ithis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much didyou part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?--Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleepsomewhere.--Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at theintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariablydoes. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will yousleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question. And evensupposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at Westland Rowstation. Simply fag out there for nothing. I dont mean to presume to dictateto you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers house?--To seek misfortune, was Stephens answer.--I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloomdiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, onyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course ofconversation that he had moved.--I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.Why?--A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects thanone and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quitelegitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, stillthinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when itwas perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that Englishtourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, werepatently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to giveStephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, suchas it was, Stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing hisfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by theingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa thatwas in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink itwith the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten attwo a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the catmeanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fishheads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the thirdprecept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it beingquarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.--No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldnt personally repose much trust inthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, DrMulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. Heknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he neverrealised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didnt noticeas much as I did. But it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn thata pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulteriorobject.He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was aversatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who wasrapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, badefair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tonymedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition towhich professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning byartificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahidewas it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which hecould not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss tofathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it downto sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.--Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call pickingyour brains, he ventured to throw o.ut.The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented byfriendliness which he gave at Stephens at present morose expression offeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem asto whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or threelowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through theaffair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed mattersto more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more thanconjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, heexperienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.Adjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream carround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation weregetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in aparticularly animated way, there being some little differences between theparties.--Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!--Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano piu ...--Dice lui, pero!--Mezzo.--Farabutto! Mortacci sui!--Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa piu ...Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabmans shelter, anunpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if everbeen before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a fewhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-GoatFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual factswhich quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few momentslater saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to begreeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs andstrays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already thereengaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom theyseemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.--Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest tobreak the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape ofsolid food, say, a roll of some description.Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to orderthese commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores orwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyesapparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individualportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for someappreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor. MrBloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowingacquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in aquandary over voglio, remarked to his protege in an audible tone of voice apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast andfurious:--A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not writeyour poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! It is so melodious and full.Belladonna. Voglio.Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, sufferingfrom lassitude generally, replied:--To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.--Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at theinward reflection of there being more languages to start with than wereabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tete-a-tete put a boilingswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and arather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After which he beata retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square lookat him later on so as not to appear to. For which reason he encouragedStephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiouslypushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffeegradually nearer him.--Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, likenames. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. Whats in a name?--Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our namewas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomersboarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular,squarely by asking:--And what might your name be?Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companions boot butStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpectedquarter, answered:--Dedalus.The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good oldHollands and water.--You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.--Ive heard of him, Stephen said.Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidentlyeavesdropping too.--Hes Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same wayand nodding. All Irish.--All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the wholebusiness and he was just asking himself what possible connection when thesailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter withthe remark:--I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over hisshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and hisgestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.--Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cockshis gun over his shoulder. Aims.He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Thenhe screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the nightwith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.--Pom! he then shouted once.The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,there being still a further egg.--Pom! he shouted twice.Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, addingbloodthirstily:--Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,Never missed nor he never will.A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness sake just felt likeasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.--Beg pardon, the sailor said.--Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.--Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magicinfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. Hetoured the wide world with Henglers Royal Circus. I seen him do that inStockholm.--Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.--Murphys my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.Know where that is?--Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.--Thats right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. Thatswhere I hails from. I belongs there. Thats where I hails from. My littlewomans down there. Shes waiting for me, I know. For England, home andbeauty. Shes my own true wife I havent seen for seven years now, sailingabout.Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, thehomecoming to the mariners roadside shieling after having diddled DavyJones, a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quitea number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember CaocOLeary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poorJohn Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never aboutthe runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. Theface at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breastthe tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half,wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but Ive come to stayand make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsamefireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. And theresits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of theCrown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chairfor father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee,postmortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my gallopingtearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain withmuch love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned toone of the jarvies with the request:--You dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a dieof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object waspassed from hand to hand.--Thank you, the sailor said.He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slowstammers, proceeded:--We come up this morning eleven oclock. The threemaster Roseveanfrom Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off thisafternoon. Theres my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an insidepocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking foldeddocument.--You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,leaning on the counter.--Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, Ive circumnavigated abit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China andNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage.I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that everscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilyou. Thats how theRussians prays.--You seen queer sights, dont be talking, put in a jarvey.--Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queerthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchorsame as I chew that quid.He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between histeeth, bit ferociously:--Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and thelivers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket whichseemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along thetable. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savagewomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score ofthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.--Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs likebreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they cant bear no morechildren.See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horses liver raw.His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhornsfor several minutes if not more.--Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:--Glass. That boggles em. Glass.Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the cardto peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran asfollows: Tarjeta Postal, Senor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile.There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or theeggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and theLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on whichoccasion the formers ball passed through the latters hat) having detected adiscrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he representedhimself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed thecompass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of themissive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friends bona fidesnevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant toone day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London vialong sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extentbut he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he hadconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyheadwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would worka pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped upwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it didcome to planking down the needful and breaking Boyds heart it was not sodear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare toMullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. Thetrip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in everyway thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out oforder, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth,Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights ofthe great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtlesshe would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane torenew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no meansbad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about tryingto make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing themost prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstratehydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautifulBournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which mightprove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratchcompany or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P MCoy type lend meyour valise and Ill post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all starIrish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legalconsort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes andMoody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine ofsuccess, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by somefellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thuscombine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.Also, without beingactually positive, it struck him a great field was tobe opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with thetimes apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, wasonce more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usualquantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheadsgenerally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterpriseto meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.Brown, Robinson and Co.It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and nosmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry poundswas debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of beingalways and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for awife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months ofit and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in thesummertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular bestconstituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equallyexcellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvanspots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as abracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesqueenvirons even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also fartheraway from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland,an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didnt comedown, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the coup d ilwas exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easilygetatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might beconsidering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with itshistoric associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace OMalley,George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was afavourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young mens fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling offthe cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg,it being only about three quarters of an hours run from the pillar. Becauseof course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so tospeak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting tofathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, waswhether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the twosides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passedit along to Stephen.--I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pillwas something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another wasa flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces theglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.--And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back.Knife like that.Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite inkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.--In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellowhid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet yourGod, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their furtherquestions even should they by any chance want to.--Thats a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.After which harrowing denouement sufficient to appal the stoutest hesnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before inhis chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.--Theyre great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in thedark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the parkmurders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them usingknives.At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance isbliss Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctivelyexchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nousvariety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, notturning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. Hisinscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself,beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didnt understandone jot of what was going on. Funny, very!There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fitsand starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with thenatives choza de, another the seamans discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as hewas personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividlyrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday,roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles,when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in theeighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.--Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.--Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ayor no.--Ah, youve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking hehad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but hefailed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, andshook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.--What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall theboats?Our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily beforeanswering:--Im tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Saltjunk all the time.Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was notlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell towoolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe,suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it coveredfully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant torule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near theNorth Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidentlyderelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on thewall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woodsand pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why.Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up anddown the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, notexactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there wasreally no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into theminutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there inall its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had tosail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show howpeople usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow likethe hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically thesame lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was ahighly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter whereliving inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to themlike that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters andcoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid theelements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every manand so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime notforgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment,rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkablychoppy, not to say stormy, weather.--There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himselfa rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemansvalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers Ive on me and he gave mean oilskin and that jackknife. Im game for that job, shaving and brushup.I hate roaming about. Theres my son now, Danny, run off to sea and hismother got him took in a drapers in Cork where he could be drawing easymoney.--What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away fromthe carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and astrong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.--Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?Hed be about eighteen now, way I figure it.The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or uncleananyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on whichwas to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to representan anchor.--There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. Imust get a wash tomorrow or next day. Its them black lads I objects to. Ihate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly draggedhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of themariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure  and a youngmans sideface looking frowningly rather.--Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iyingbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, thename of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.--Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.Someway in his. Squeezing or.--See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. Andthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with hisfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.And in point of fact the young man named Antonios livid face didactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited theunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who thistime stretched over.--Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. Hes gonetoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expressionof before.--Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.--And whats the number for? loafer number two queried.--Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.--Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time withsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction ofthe questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering hisalleged end:--As bad as old Antonio,For he left me on my ownio.The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black strawhat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring onher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the momentflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheetof the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside,he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. Hisreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door thesame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormondquay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady inthe brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of hiswashing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, yourwashing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifesundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did tooa mans similar garments initialled with Bewley and Drapers marking ink(hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, lovemy dirty shirt. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the femalesroom more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keepermade her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the EveningTelegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of thedoor with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactlyall there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers roundskipper Murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of her.--The gunboat, the keeper said.--It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, howa wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with diseasecan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if hevalues his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I supposesome man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter whatthe cause is from ...Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merelyremarking:--In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaringtrade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or aprude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put astop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from anyoldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere notlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he couldtruthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from thevery first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, andventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybodyconcerned.--You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe inthe soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, asdistinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I believein that myself because it has been explained by competent men as theconvolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have suchinventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memoryto try and concentrate and remember before he could say:--They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and thereforeincorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility ofits annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capableof adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per seand corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though themystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he feltbound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:--Simple? I shouldnt think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you,to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to inventthose rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it wasbefore his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to thelaws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricitybut its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existenceof a supernatural God.--O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several ofthe bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as theywere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference intheir respective ages, clashed.--Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to hisoriginal point with a smile of unbelief. Im not so sure about that. Thats amatter for everymans opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian sideof the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tellyou the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them putin by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet overagain, who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon, as, you who knowyour Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I neednt tell you. Cantyou drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of thatbun. Its like one of our skippers bricks disguised. Still no-one can givewhat he hasnt got. Try a bit.--Couldnt, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the momentrefusing to dictate further.Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well tostir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with somethingapproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (andlucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or naydid a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run onteetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and usefullectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On theother hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife,Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it atone time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. Theidea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit,there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO orsomething in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheapeatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or where.Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him morethan ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr TibblesVi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.--Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mugfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle andtook a sip of the offending beverage.--Still its solid food, his good genius urged, Im a stickler for solid food,his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regularmeals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.--Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away thatknife. I cant look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminatedarticle, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularlyRoman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was theleast conspicuous point about it.--Our mutual friends stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of knivesremarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? Hecould spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.Look at him.Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was fullof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quitewithin the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication thoughat first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he gotoff his chest being strictly accurate gospel.He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of himand Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Thougha wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, therewas something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail deliveryand it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such aweirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He mighteven have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as peopleoften did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had servedhis four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of theAntonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical namewho sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes inthe melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might beonly bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs,Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would temptany ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow aboutthe schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done thelies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candleto the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.--Mind you, Im not saying that its all a pure invention, he resumed.Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, thoughthat is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen. Inthose waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they arecalled, sitting bowlegged, they couldnt straighten their legs if you paidthem because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on hiscompanion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call thembehind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so longcramped up, being adored as gods. Theres an example again of simplesouls.However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures(who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied theboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with themanagement in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host ofadmirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear himthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell abit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatibleabout it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quitein keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free toadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chippotato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe weresober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given topothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of othersat night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur offhim or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.--Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that,impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own handsand give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry inthe abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, soto speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could actually claimSpanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain,i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black.I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character. Thats why Iasked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.--The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were verypassionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.--Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.--Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknownlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isoscelestriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san TommasoMastino.--Its in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the bloodof the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was justlooking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips,bosom. You simply dont knock against those kind of women here. An exceptionhere and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what Imtalking about is the female form. Besides they have so little taste in dress,most of them, which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty, no matterwhat you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine butstill its a thing I simply hate to see.Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and thenthe others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, goocollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course had hisown say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered amonsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils ofthe deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to thateffect, a pious medal he had that saved him.So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunts rock, wreckof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for themoment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbellremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the townthat year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times), breakers running overher and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified withhorror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. LadyCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack inrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given.Her master, the Monas, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead wouldgive way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary forhim to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.--Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was justgently dropping off into a peaceful doze.He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to thedoor, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter andbore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom whonoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rumsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burninginterior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applyingits nozze to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with agurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicionthat the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction inthe shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents andpurposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by hisrum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop linerather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since hislast visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed himto the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place forthe purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reignedsupreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer athand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing onthe ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoofscooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightlydisturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of thecorporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up,was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practicallyon the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all humanprobability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted aboutand shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms ofMorpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on afellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent homecomforts all his life who came in for a cool  pounds a year at one timewhich of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks anddrakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having oftenpainted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. He drank needlessto be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easilybe in a large way of business if--a big if, however--he had contrived to curehimself of his particular partiality.All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the samething. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, theonly launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no shipsever called.There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidentlyau fait.What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against theonly rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted bya Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, headvised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for thatdays work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.--Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after hisprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or wordsgrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or otherin seconds or thirds. Mr Blooms sharp ears heard him then expectorate theplug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the timebeing in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and foundit a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after hissuccessful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink intothe soiree, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:--The biscuits was as hard as brassAnd the beef as salt as Lots wifes arse.O, Johnny Lever!Johnny Lever, O!After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on thescene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the formprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe togrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent thenatural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described inhis lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of Godsearth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, sixmillion pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions betweenbutter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxeson the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up thebest meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Theirconversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was afact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there wasthat colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where wouldyou find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he statedcrescendo with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all theconversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf onaccount of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, heaffirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem Englandwas toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel,which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, theGreek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely grippedtheir attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice toevery Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Irelandand live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one ofher sons.Silence all round marked the termination of his finale. Thel o l oimpervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.--Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bitpeeved in response to the foregoing truism.To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeperconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.--Whos the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran iratelyinterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals andgenerals weve got? Tell me that.--The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishesapart.--Thats right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant.Hes the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeperadded he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered noIrishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a fewirascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to thelisteners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as theydidnt indulge in recriminations and come to blows.From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloomwas rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdashfor, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, hewas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealedtheir strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic ideain certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of thesister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out tobe how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as ahost of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then itwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countrieseven though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours ofwhores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irishsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of theplace rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, andthe other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours withthe confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron,a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasnt the other person at all,he (B.) couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give peoplelike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse tohave anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and theirfelonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman comingforward and turning queens evidence or kings now like Denis or PeterCarey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he dislikedthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though suchcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shapeor form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remainingwhat he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actuallybrandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions(though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off thesame bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her,when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the twoconcerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had thepair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of analternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her, until it juststruck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the, merely drove the car for the      ******************************~~actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliablyinformed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the pleasome legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancienthistory by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he hadtransparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturallyor on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell positively lastperformance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault of course,temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping atthe bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion thatMr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d. in the course of his perambulations                              ***~~round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern,come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not solong before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply buteffectually silenced the offender.--He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on thewhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in aheated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts in theleast told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family likeme though in reality Im not. That was one for him. A soft answer turnsaway wrath. He hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I notright? He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous darkpride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemedto glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly. --Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or foureyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other,secundum carnem.--Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides ofthe question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right andwrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though everycountry, they say, our own distressful included, has the government itdeserves. But with a little goodwill all round. Its all very fine to boast ofmutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent violence andintolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stopsanything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. Its a patentabsurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the cornerand speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.--Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war, Stephenassented, between Skinners alley and Ormond market.Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, thatwas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort ofthing.--You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus ofconflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely ...All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up badblood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, werevery largely a question of the money question which was at the back ofeverything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.--They accuse, remarked he audibly.He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to,so as the others in case they.--Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephens ear, are accused ofruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would you besurprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisitionhounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, anuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. Theyare practical and are proved to be so. I dont want to indulge in any becauseyou know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks.Its in the dogma. Because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heavenwhen they die theyd try to live better, at least so I think. Thats thejuggle on which the p.ps raise the wind on false pretences. Im, he resumedwith dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you aboutat the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classespro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashioneither, something in the neighbourhood of  pounds per annum. Thats thevital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlierintercourse between man and man. At least thats my idea for what itsworth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of inour classical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, thesense is, if you work.Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to thissynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. Hecould hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabsabout Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours ofdifferent sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneathor seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say thewords the voice he heard said, if you work.--Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the personwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, allmust work, have to, together.--I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widestpossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. Thatswork too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after allthe money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourselfand command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by yourpen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You bothbelong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.--You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Irelandfor short.--I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.--But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be importantbecause it belongs to me.--What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhapsunder some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didnt catch thelatter portion. What was it you ...?Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mugof coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  --We cant change the country. Let us change the subject.At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, lookeddown but in a quandary, as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to puton belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind wasclearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgyspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his soberstate. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importancehad not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with theright sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside himwhom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especiallyreminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light onthe subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows thatpromised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody toblame but themselves. For instance there was the case of OCallaghan, forone, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequatemeans, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rottoand making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habitof ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And thenthe usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after astrong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so asnot to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendmentact, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged forreasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, puttingtwo and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to,Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all thego in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early inlife the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of theupper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of thehead of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crownedheads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number ofyears before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, athing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on thoughnot for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was exceptwomen chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another itbeing largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who likedistinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying tomake the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuinefilip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then heuntied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, atninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting tothe original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their wayto the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force ofnatural genius, that. With brains, sir.For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty evento wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could notexactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having infact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someoneof no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amplyrepay any small. Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time totime a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence ofmeeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gonetomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to makeup a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of thesubmerged tenth, viz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very muchunder the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wonderedwhether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as MrPhilip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen somethingout of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of oneguinea per column. My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabmans Shelter.The pink edition extra sporting of the Telegraph tell a graphic lie lay,as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again,far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebusthe vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed A.

Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, hereflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address anyway.--This morning (Hynes put it in of course) the remains of the late MrPatrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no  Newbridge Avenue,Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was amost popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a briefillness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeplyregretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present,were carried out by (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny)Messrs H. J. ONeill and Son,  North Strand Road. The mournersincluded: Patk.

Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.--It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to thearchbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could beno possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bitflabbergasted at Myles Crawfords after all managing to.

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though asthe event turned out the poor fool hadnt much reason to congratulatehimself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself toeventually.--There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.--Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, andread: Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier wasin that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it waskilled him.

Then they would all to a man have gone down ontheir marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.Dead he wasnt. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they broughtover was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at theirmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and notsingly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it wastwenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow oftruth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highlyinadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in hisdeath. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when hisvarious different political arrangements were nearing completion orwhether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to changehis boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing toconsult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died ofit amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possiblythey were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of coursenobody being acquainted with his movements even before there wasabsolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice,where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliasessuch as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabbymight be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey onhis mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and acommanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in hisstockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they werent even apatch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming featureswere very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol withfeet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on himwith mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You hadto come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show theunderstudy in the title role how to. He saw him once on the auspiciousoccasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it UnitedIreland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed himhis silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as heundoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the littlemisadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: whats bred in thebone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if they didnt set theterrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usuallyfollowed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, youcame up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentialslike the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, Bellawas the boats name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down inas the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink,lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details fromsome pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the descriptiongiven, introduce himself with: Excuse me, my name is So and So or somesuch commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to thenot over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussionbeside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.--That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietorcommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.--Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk HenryCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a mans thighs. Iseen her picture in a barbers. The husband was a captain or an officer.--Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned afair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom he,without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction ofthe  door and reflected upon the historic story which had arousedextraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, weremade public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them fullof sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened andan attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climaxand the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came asa welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who wereresolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was publicproperty all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that itsubsequently blossomed into. Since their names were coupled, though, sincehe was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity toproclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that hehad shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when athrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in theshape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such aparticular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment withthe assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in thesame fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simplycoined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was itwas simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothingin common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving onthe scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her sirencharms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved onessmiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, croppedup. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case,exist between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirsabsolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave offolly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmentedobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other militarysupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, mygallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the lth hussarsto be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not theother) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quicklyperceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fairto do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhilestaunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had doneyeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels ontheir behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, veryeffectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire onhis head much in the same way as the fabled asss kick. Looking back nowin a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. Andthen coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went withoutsaying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in forquite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, hewent to reside on the north side. North or south, however, it was just thewellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecartwith a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she alsowas Spanish or half so, types that wouldnt do things by halves, passionateabandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.--Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen,about blood and the sun. And, if I dont greatly mistake she was Spanishtoo.--The king of Spains daughter, Stephen answered, adding something orother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions andthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so andso many.--Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by anymeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it wasas she lived there. So, Spain.Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which remindedhim by the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out hispocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidlyfinally he.--Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photowhich he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing alarge sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion asshe was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiouslylow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more thanvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near,ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old Madrid, aballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the ladys)eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to beadmired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublins premier photographicartist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.--Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloomindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like herthen.Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of MajorBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as asinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numberedbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expressionbut it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of noticeusually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup. Shecould without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwellon certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in hisspare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it sohappened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble couldgive the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes,puritanisme, it does though Saint Josephs sovereign thievery alors(Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasntart in a word.The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tarsgood example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speakfor itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty forhimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the cameracould not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully coolfor the season considering, for sunshine after storm. And he did feel a kindof need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfya possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing theslightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wearhowever, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not furtherincreasing the others possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetryof heaving embonpoint. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charmlike the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact withthe starch out. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp whichshe told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his becausehe then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book aboutRuby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell downsufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies toLindley Murray.The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,distingue and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of thebunch though you wouldnt think he had it in him yet you would. Besideshe said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though atthe moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot ofmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur withthe usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tanglealleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favouriteinstead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. Howthey were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two sothat their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letterscontaining the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving noloophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week atsome wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normalcourse, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the Kingsproctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was madeabsolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largelywere in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely didtill the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition forthe party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being closeto Erins uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on thehistoric fracas when the fallen leaders, who notoriously stuck to his guns tothe last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leaders) trustyhenchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than thatpenetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was UnitedIreland (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up thetypecases with hammers or something like that all on account of somescurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the OBrienite scribes at theusual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribunes privatemorals. Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commandingfigure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purposewhich went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to theirvast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon apedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those wereparticularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minorinjury from a nasty prod of some chaps elbow in the crowd that of coursecongregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunatelynot of a grave character. His hat (Parnells) a silk one was inadvertentlyknocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man whopicked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to returnit to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who pantingand hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time allthe same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matterof fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anythingelse, whats bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mothersknee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at oncebecause he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfectaplomb, saying: Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voicefrom the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set torights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with adifference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alonein his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to thegrave.On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatantjokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and thewherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case forthe two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husbandhappened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usualboy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in aloving position locked in one anothers arms, drawing attention to theirillicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fairone begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees andpromising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if onlythe aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones bebygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her faircheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others. Hepersonally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didnt make the smallestbones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were alwayshanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was thebest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake ofargument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded lifeand was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentionson her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred onanother, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married womengetting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famouscases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance ofbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time withprofligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him hislifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take untohimself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladiessociety was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possibledoubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about MissFerguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought himdown to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would findmuch satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and thecompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweeklywith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walkingout leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs. To think of himhouse and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother,was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out withattracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like hisfather but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it onlyan eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, thehomely Humpty Dumpty boiled.--At what oclock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tiredthough unwrinkled face.--Some time yesterday, Stephen said.--Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrowFriday. Ah, you mean its after twelve!--The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.Though they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy theresomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the onetrain of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score ofyears previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentaryhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (whichwas a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard forthose same ultra ideas. For instance when the evicted tenants question, thenat its first inception, bulked largely in peoples mind though, it goeswithout saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely toits dictums, some of which wouldnt exactly hold water, he at the outset inprinciple at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession asvoicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realisinghis mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twittedwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at onetime inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he stronglyresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friendat the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernans so that he, though oftenconsiderably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be itrepeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically)one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, hewas only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting frompropaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and sufferingit entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly,destruction of the fittest, in a word.Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as itwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bitrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebodyhaving a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as onthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lamepaw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he hadhurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered,having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far andaway too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he wasin some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. Everything pointed tothe fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity,all things considered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffishor not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightntwhat you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried himwas he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he didentertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure ifhe would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, iffound suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for thenonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Eppss cocoa and a shakedown forthe night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow atleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failedto perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso norumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because thatmerry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued tothe spot, didnt appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to hisdearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some spongersbawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff streetlower would be the best clue to that equivocal characters whereabouts for afew days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids) withsixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freezethe marrow of anybodys bones and mauling their largesized charmsbetweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of largepotations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who hein reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebraremarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentlerepartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. Peoplecould put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was abite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles. Yourgod was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came fromCarrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.--I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection whileprudently pocketing her photo, as its rather stuffy here you just come homewith me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.You cant drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. Ill just pay this lot.The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plainsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper ofthe shanty who didnt seem to.--Yes, thats the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of thatBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bs) busy brain,education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up todate billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydrosand seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accentperfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, ofcourse, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and aslice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspectedhe had his fathers voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cardshe had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail theconversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the formerviceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner inLondon somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrillingannouncement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to havesome spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had leftEuston for the chief secretarys lodge or words to that effect. To whichabsorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.--Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner putin, manifesting some natural impatience.--And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggleswhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.--Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerkqueried.--Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was abit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholesas you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the RedSea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner ofspeaking. The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite and Red asa Rose is She.Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord onlyknows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremongerhaving made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts,during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intenselyoccupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot whichmanifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all ofthem who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facialexpressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing atrivial remark.To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the firstto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first andforemost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for theoccasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host asa parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not lookingto the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total offourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literallythe last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printedpricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffeed, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in away, as Wetherup used to remark.--Come, he counselled to close the seance.Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left theshelter or shanty together and the elite society of oilskin and companywhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce farniente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out,paused at the, for a moment, the door.--One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of themoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upsidedown, on the tables in cafes.To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without amoments hesitation, saying straight off:--To sweep the floor in the morning.So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the sametime apologetic to get on his companions right, a habit of his, by the bye,his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night airwas certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak onhis pins.--It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in amoment. The only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man. Come.Its not far. Lean on me.Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephens right and led him onaccordingly.--Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind offlesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where themunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposeswrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of freshfields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy wasnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwoout of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split andchiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants hehad put in their holdings.So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for whichBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracksarm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedlygrand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at thefirst go-off but the music of Mercadantes Huguenots, Meyerbeers SevenLast Words on the Cross and Mozarts Twelfth Mass he simply revelled in,the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such,literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferredthe sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop couldoffer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to liveand I will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in hisadmiration of Rossinis Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding inimmortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, averitable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureisand putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers church inupper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hearher with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinionthat there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place ofworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desirefor an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of theDon Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant,though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school suchas Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all aboutthe old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionels air in Martha,Mappari, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be moreaccurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips ofStephens respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, infact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to apolitely put query, said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises ofShakespeares songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenistDowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who annosludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasingfrom Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the namecertainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son withtheir dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals,he said, in the Queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and oneTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speakingbeyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the pavenground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloomwas not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion tosixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the politicalcelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as astriking coincidence.By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the otherssleeve gently, jocosely remarking:--Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse notworth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quitenear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even fleshbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, ataildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lordof his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a goodpoor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but, as he wiselyreflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that mightcrop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, withouta second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrelin Barney Kiernans, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But itwas no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel,ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths ofthem all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barringthe bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of hisback and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mindsomewhat distracted from Stephens words while the ship of the street wasmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.--Whats this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging inmedias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making youracquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsomeblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after ashe was perhaps not that way built.Still, supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected, itopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingalls Irish industries,concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here hasEnd by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frowscome from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeepabout the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,which boggled Bloom a bit:Von der Sirenen ListigkeitTun die Poeten dichten.These opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom,nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by allmeans which he did.A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, ifproperly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such asBarraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command itsown price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunatepossessor in the near future an entree into fashionable houses in the bestresidential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business andtitled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way)and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression hewould infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains whichalso could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clotheswere properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their goodgraces as he, a youthful tyro in--societys sartorial niceties, hardlyunderstood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was infact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participatingin their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of theChristmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of thefair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which,as he happened to know, were on record--in fact, without giving the showaway, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Addedto which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no mean.s to besneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised,that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyricplatform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in therequired direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily andmentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and itoften turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneededmoment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly haddeteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from theconventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decidednovelty for Dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchytenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and HiltonSt Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he couldwith all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a namefor himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he couldcommand a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for thepatrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcomingto kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of thegoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract fromthe other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of timeto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doingwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatorywhatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball athis feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of aremarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity hepurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on thefools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connectionwith a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparageand even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present,deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Blooms humbleopinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character, no punintended.The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, haltedand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall onthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smokingglobes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper hemired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient inhis scythed car.Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passedthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over astrand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singingmore boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.Und alle Schiffe brucken.The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merelywatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, onefull, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by FatherMaher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuingtheir tete-a-tete (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirensenemies of mans reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the samecategory, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweepercar or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldntpossibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end oflower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place theyfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets andMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardinersplace by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then,at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street,north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxedwalking pace they crossed both the circus before Georges churchdiametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which itsubtends.Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on thegrowth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergencydustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irishnation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, themaleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephens collapse.Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respectivelike and unlike reactions to experience?Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plasticor pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, acisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by earlydomestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistanceprofessed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social andethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtundinginfluence of heterosexual magnetism.Were their views on some points divergent?Stephen dissented openly from Blooms views on the importance of dietaryand civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephens views on theeternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assentedcovertly to Stephens rectification of the anachronism involved in assigningthe date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidismby Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by popeCelestine I in the year  in the reign of Leary to the year  orthereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (   A.D.), suffocated byimperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. Thecollapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemicalcompounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength,accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in arelaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinalcloud (perceived by both from two different points of observationSandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a womans hand.Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoiningparaheliotropic trees.Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations inthe past?In  with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on publicthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonards corner andLeonards corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.In  with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wallbetween Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony ofUppercross. In  occasionally with casual acquaintances andprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third classrailway carriages of suburban lines. In  frequently with major BrianTweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately onthe lounge in Matthew Dillons house in Roundtown. Once in  andonce in  with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in theparlour of his (Blooms) house in Lombard street, west.What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates , ,, , , ,  did Bloom make before their arrival at theirdestination?He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individualdevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a restrictionof the converse domain of interindividual relations.As in what ways?From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existenceto nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?At the housesteps of the th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket ofhis trousers to obtain his latchkey.Was it there?It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn onthe day but one preceding.Why was he doubly irritated?Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had remindedhimself twice not to forget.What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)and inadvertently, keyless couple?To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.Blooms decision?A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the arearailings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lowerunion of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length offive feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of thearea pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separatinghimself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact ofthe fall.Did he fall?By his bodys known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupoismeasure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighingin the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, thetwelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred andfour of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred andsixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo),golden number , epact , solar cycle , dominical letters C B, Romanindiction , Julian period , MCMIV.Did he rise uninjured by concussion?Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed bythe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at itsfreely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum,gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery,ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas byturningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced toquiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparentkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of  CP, a man lighting acandle of  CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a manleaving the kitchen holding a candle.Did the man reappear elsewhere?After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discerniblethrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of thedoorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.Did Stephen obey his sign?Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followedsoftly along the hallway the mans back and listed feet and lighted candlepast a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turningstaircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Blooms house.What did Bloom do?He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with itsback to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on oneknee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks andvarious coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal attwentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and MDonald of DOlier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with oneignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in thefuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free unionwith the oxygen of the air.Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the collegeof the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county ofKildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his firstresidence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmotherMiss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at Ushers Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in thekitchen of their lodgings at  Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wifeof Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond streeton the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier : of the dean ofstudies, Father Butt, in the physics theatre of university College, Stephens Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his fathers house inCabra.What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from thefire towards the opposite wall?Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretchedbetween two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier,from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattachedconsecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose withLisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by threeerect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their pointof junction.What did Bloom see on the range?On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger)hob a black iron kettle.What did Bloom do at the range?He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle tothe sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.Did it flow?Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filtermains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs andCallowhill to the  acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of  statutemiles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, thoughfrom prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of  million gallons the***************************************************~~water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason theborough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., onthe instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use ofmunicipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisagingthe possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grandand Royal canals as in ) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians,notwithstanding their ration of  gallons per day per pauper suppliedthrough a  inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of , gallonsper night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent ofthe corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detrimentof another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,returning to the range, admire?Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature inseeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercators projection: itsunplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turnall points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability ofstates of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidityin neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility inthe circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercialsignificance: its preponderance of  to  over the dry land of the globe: itsindisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the regionbelow the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of itsprimeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold insolution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the mostprecious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistentformation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtendingpromontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: itsimperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of coloursin the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications incontinental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers withtheir tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and southequatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells,eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds,waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations,deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: itssecrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic orhygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in thewall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: thesimplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen withone constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancyin the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativenessin runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its propertiesfor cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: itsinfallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist,cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its varietyof forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons andatolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidalestuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: itsdocility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric powerstations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentialityderivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level tolevel: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquityas constituting  percent of the human body: the noxiousness of itseffluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater,stagnant pools in the waning moon.Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did hereturn to the stillflowing tap?To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barringtonslemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hourspreviously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh coldneverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a longredbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.What reason did Stephen give for declining Blooms offer?That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total bysubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the monthof October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances ofglass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene andprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning apreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapidsplashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case ofsea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to coldbeing the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energyin bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamedand the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment andrecuperation.What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by theagency of fire?The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught ofventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition wascommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedralmasses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form thefoliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derivedtheir vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant),transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat(convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, wasconstantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification tothe liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the unevenunpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in partabsorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of thewater from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as theresult of an expenditure of  thermal units needed to raise  pound ofwater from  degrees to  degrees Fahrenheit.What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at bothsides simultaneously.For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?To shave himself.What advantages attended shaving by night?A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shaveto shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedlyencountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation whenawaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions andperturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postmans double knock, a paper read,reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, withthought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause afaster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precisioncut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculinefeminine passive active hand.What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteractinginfluence?The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed humanblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their naturalorder, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of thekitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfastsaucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup,uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups,an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial ofaromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containingpepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginouspaper, an empty pot of Plumtrees potted meat, an oval wicker basketbedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle ofWilliam Gilbey and Cos white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe ofcoralpink tissue paper, a packet of Eppss soluble cocoa, five ounces ofAnne Lynchs choice tea at /- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, acylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions,one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected withaugmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairys cream, ajug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of souredadulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum andsemisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for MrBlooms and Mrs Flemings breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the totalquantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dishcontaining a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars(empty) of various sizes and proveniences.What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered ,  .What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative ofthe result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive resultof which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in thecabmans shelter, at Butt bridge.Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, beenreceived by him?In Bernard Kiernans licensed premises ,  and  little Britain street: inDavid Byrnes licensed premises,  Duke street: in OConnell street lower,outside Graham Lemons when a dark man had placed in his hand athrowaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of thechurch in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny andCo (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam)Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted thecopy of the current issue of the Freemans Journal and National Presswhich he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), hehad proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenanceand bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language ofprediction.What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any eventfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed theelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss byfailure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceedingoriginally from a successful interpretation.His mood?He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he wassatisfied.What satisfied him?To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain toothers. Light to the gentiles.How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Eppsssoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed onthe label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribedingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show hisguest?Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitationCrown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), hesubstituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarilyto his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous creamordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks ofhospitality?His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he acceptedthem seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Eppss massproduct, thecreature cocoa.Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to completethe act begun?The reparation of a fissure of the length of  inches in the right***********************************************~~side of his guests jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the fourladys handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentablecondition. Who drank more quickly?Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steadyflow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponents one, six to two,nine to three.What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion wasengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived fromliterature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself hadapplied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for thesolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.Had he found their solution?In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,the answers not bearing in all points.What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,potential poet, at the age of  in  on the occasion of the offeringof three prizes of /-, /- and / respectively for competition by theShamrock, a weekly newspaper?An ambition to squintAt my verses in printMakes me hope that for these youll find room?.If you so condescendThen please place at the endThe name of yours truly, L. Bloom.Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?Name, age, race, creed.What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?Leopold BloomEllpodbomoolMolldopeloobBollopedoomOld Ollebo, M. P.What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet)sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the  February ?Poets oft have sung in rhymeOf music sweet their praise divine.Let them hymn it nine times nine.Dearer far than song or wine.You are mine. The world is mine.What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now,commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, , , , South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valleyof diamonds, of the second edition ( January ) of the grandannual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (produced by R Shelton December , written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery byGeorge A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelanunder the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets byJessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,principal girl?Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, theanticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born , acceded )and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly,apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of therespective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York(real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflictbetween professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning therecent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the TheatreRoyal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassionfor Nelly Bouverists non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expressionof countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverists revelationsof white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topicalunderclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, thedifficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusionsfrom Everybodys Book of Jokes ( pages and a laugh in every one):sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with thenames of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, ThomasPile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.What relation existed between their ages? years before in  when Bloom was of Stephens present age Stephenwas .  years after in  when Stephen would be of Blooms present ageBloom would be . In  when Bloom would be  and Stephen  theirages initially in the ratio of  to  would be as  to , the proportion****************************************************~~    ~~increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future yearswere added, for if the proportion existing in  had continued immutable,conceiving that to be possible, till then  when Stephen was  Bloomwould be  and in  when Stephen would be , as Bloom then was,Bloom would be  while in  when Stephen would have attained themaximum postdiluvian age of  Bloom, being  years alive having beenborn in the year , would have surpassed by  years the maximumantediluvian age, that of Methusalah,  years, while, if Stephen wouldcontinue to live until he would attain that age in the year  A.D., Bloomwould have been obliged to have been alive , years, having beenobliged to have been born in the year , B.C.What events might nullify these calculations?The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new eraor calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination ofthe human species, inevitable but impredictable.How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillons house, Medina Villa,Kimmage road, Roundtown, in , in the company of Stephens mother,Stephen being then of the age of  and reluctant to give his hand insalutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslins hotel on a rainySunday in the January of , in the company of Stephens father andStephens granduncle, Stephen being then  years older.Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son andafterwards seconded by the father?Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciativegratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a thirdconnecting link between them?Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in thehouse of Stephens parents from  September  to  December and had also resided during the years ,  and  in the City ArmsHotel owned by Elizabeth ODowd of  Prussia street where, during partsof the years  and , she had been a constant informant of Bloomwho resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in theemployment of Joseph Cuffe of  Smithfield for the superintendence of salesin the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirmwidow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair withslow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circularroad opposite Mr Gavin Lows place of business where she had remainedfor a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglassesunrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped withinflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hiredlandaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to thePhoenix Park and vice versa.Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel ofbossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continualchanges of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes,vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round therim of a round and round precipitous globe.What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, hersuppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhaldeafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of theImmaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for CharlesStewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenationwhich these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered themore desirable?The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequentlyabandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandows Physical Strength and How toObtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged insedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in frontof a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles andproduce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and themost pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circlegyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled inhis stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on theparallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominalmuscles.Did either openly allude to their racial difference?Neither.What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Blooms thoughtsabout Stephens thoughts about Bloom and about Stephens thoughts aboutBlooms thoughts about Stephen?He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that heknew that he knew that he was not.What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respectiveparentages?Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequentlyRudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London andDublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (bornKaroly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving maleconsubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric orlayman?Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone, inthe protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by JamesOConnor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pumpin the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in thechurch of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverendCharles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.Did they find their educational careers similar?Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successivelythrough a dames school and the high school. Substituting Bloom forStephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through thematriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of theroyal university.Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the universityof life?Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation hador had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.What two temperaments did they individually represent?The scientific. The artistic.What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towardsapplied, rather than towards pure, science?Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in astate of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciationof the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, forexample, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiralcorkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock withwinch and sluice, the suction pump.Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme ofkindergarten?Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelveconstellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanicalorreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond withzoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.What also stimulated him in his cogitations?The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,the former by his d bazaar at  Georges street, south, the latter athis d shop and worlds fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at  Henry*****~~street, admission d, children d: and the infinite possibilities hithertounexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteralmonoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined),horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetisingefficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince,to decide.Such as?K.

Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat.Plamtroo.Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality,though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn bya beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seatedengaged in writing.What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corneryoung man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. Shegoes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotelpaper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. Shehurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. Heholds it towards fire. Twilight.

Queens Ho...What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?The Queens Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (RudolfVirag) died on the evening of the  June , at some hour unstated, inconsequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in theform of a neuralgic liniment composed of  parts of aconite liniment to I ofchloroform liniment (purchased by him at . a.m. on the morning of June  at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy,  Church street, Ennis)after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at . p.m.on the afternoon of  June  a new boater straw hat, extra smart (afterhaving, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and inthe place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store ofJames Cullen,  Main street, Ennis.Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence orintuition?Coincidence.Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?He preferred himself to see anothers face and listen to anothers words bywhich potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him,described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable ofthe Plums?It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent byimplication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms(e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composedduring schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunctionwith the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social,personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as modelpedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory andjunior grade students or contributed in printed form, following theprecedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblons Studies in Blue, toa publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally asintellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative ofsuccessful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement,during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summersolstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,  June (S.Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise . a.m., sunset . p.m.Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequentlyengaged his mind?What to do with our wives.What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap,spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess orbackgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothingsociety: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar andpiano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to varietyentertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding andpleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigardivan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculinebrothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regularinfrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventivesuperintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectabilityin the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to renderliberal instruction agreeable.What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him infavour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paperwith signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish andHebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals asto the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city inCanada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal,or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills shefrequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolarycompositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encausticpigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol andnutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phoneticallyor by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these andsuch deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances,proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency ofjudgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at acertain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latentknowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent othersignorant lapse.With what success had he attempted direct instruction?She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interestcomprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficultyremembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeatedwith error.What system had proved more effective?Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.Example?She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she dislikednew hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat withrain, she carried umbrella with new hat.Accepting the analogy implied in his guests parable which examples ofpostexilic eminence did he adduce?Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,author of More Nebukim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohnof such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) therearose none like Moses (Maimonides).What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourthseeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, byStephen?That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,name uncertain.Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of aselected or rejected race mentioned?Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irishlanguages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts byguest to host and by host to guest?By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care). By Bloom:kifeloch, harimon rakatejch mbaad lzamatejch (thy temple amid thy hairis as a slice of pomegranate).How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languagesmade in substantiation of the oral comparison?By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferiorliterary style, entituled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and somanipulated that its front cover carne in contact with the surface of thetable) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irishcharacters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turnwrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence ofmem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinaland cardinal numbers, videlicet , , , and .Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, theextinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence andsyntax and practically excluding vocabulary.What points of contact existed between these languages and between thepeoples who spoke them?The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servileletters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on theplain of Shinar  years after the deluge in the seminary instituted byFenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendantof Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological,genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historicaland religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah,Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the DunCow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal,persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical andecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Marys Abbey) and masshouse (Adam andEves tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws andjewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and thepossibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,ethnically irreducible consummation?Kolod balejwaw pnimahNefesch, jehudi, homijah.Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?By a periphrastic version of the general text.In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphichieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation ofmodern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).Did the guest comply with his hosts request?Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.What was Stephens auditive sensation?He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulationof the past.What was Blooms visual sensation?He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.What were Stephens and Blooms quasisimultaneous volitionalquasisensations of concealed identities?Visually, Stephens: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted byJohannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus asleucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.Auditively, Blooms: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with whatexemplars?In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the veryreverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost ofTrinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stagemodern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedianOsmond Tearle (  ), exponent of Shakespeare.Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strangelegend on an allied theme?Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, beingsecluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolidresidual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus creamplus cocoa, having been consumed.Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows allWent out for to play ball.And the very first ball little Harry Hughes playedHe drove it oer the jews garden wall.And the very second ball little Harry Hughes playedHe broke the jews windows all.[NOTE: for Graphic use viewer or print]How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw theunbroken kitchen window.Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.Then out there came the jews daughterAnd she all dressed in green."Come back, come back,you pretty little boy,And play your ball again.""I cant come back and I wont come backWithout my schoolfellows all.For if my master he did hearHed make it a sorry ball."She took him by the lilywhite handAnd led him along the hallUntil she led him to a roomWhere none could hear him call.She took a penknife out of her pocketAnd cut off  his little head.And now hell play his ball no moreFor he lies among the dead.How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jewsdaughter, all dressed in green.Condense Stephens commentary.One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertencetwice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandonedand challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holdshim unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidelapartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him shouldby him not be told.Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: theincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, thepropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy ofopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavisticdelinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnoticsuggestion and somnambulism.From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totallyimmune?From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised hissleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinitetime incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once,sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of aheatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated,in night attire had lain, sleeping.Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any memberof his family?Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent(Milly) at the ages of  and  years had uttered in sleep an exclamation ofterror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attirewith a vacant mute expression.What other infantile memories had he of her? June . A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause andlessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocksher moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee:a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blondancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army,proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.What endemic characteristics were present?Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line oflineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals tomore distant intervals to its most distant intervals.What memories had he of her adolescence?She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the dukes lawn,entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and takeaway her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circularroad in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinisteraspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back(reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the th anniversary of herbirth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a briefallusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,if differently?A temporary departure of his cat.Why similarly, why differently?Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because ofdifferent possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.In other respects were their differences similar?In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.As?Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it forher (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake inStephens green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit,describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of itspermanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequencesof a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cfearwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had anunspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had beenJoseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it(he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, inpassivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, theirdifferences were similar.In what way had he utilised gifts () an owl, ) a clock), given asmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?As object lessons toexplain: ) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility ofaerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular processof imbalsamation: ) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified inbob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or socialregulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on anunmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant ineach hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angleof inclination, videlicet,  / minutes past each hour per hour inarithmetical progression.In what manners did she reciprocate?She remembered: on the th anniversary of his birth she presented to him abreakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. Sheprovided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had beenmade by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities,anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having beenexplained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possesswithout gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, thequarter, a thousandth part.What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, maketo Stephen, noctambulist?To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) andFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediatelyabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of hishost and hostess.What various advantages would or might have resulted from aprolongation of such an extemporisation?For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host:rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess:disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and ahostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventualityof reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jews daughter?Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to motherthrough daughter.To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest returna monosyllabic negative answer?If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at SydneyParade railway station,  October .What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by thehost?A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment ofMrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding),  June , vigil of the anniversaryof the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).Was the proposal of asylum accepted?Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.What exchange of money took place between host and guest?The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money(--), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to theformer.What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place theresidence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction,place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of staticsemistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence ofboth speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Shiphotel and tavern,  Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors),the National Library of Ireland,  Kildare street, the National MaternityHospital, ,  and  Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of aplace of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, thepoint of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences(if both speakers were resident in different places).What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutuallyselfexcluding propositions?The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Henglerscircus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particolouredclown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in theauditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared toan exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clowns) papa. Theimprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of  he (Bloom) hadmarked a florin (/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered itm payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, familygrocers,  Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters ofcivic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.Was the clown Blooms son?No.Had Blooms coin returned?Never.Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amendmany social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice andinternational animosity.He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating theseconditions?There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct fromhuman law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity ofdestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of theultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: themonotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human femalesextending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents atsea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultantsurgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimatingepidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of humanmentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in denselypopulated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions ofmetamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.Why did he desist from speculation?Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other moreacceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to beremoved.Did Stephen participate in his dejection?He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceedingsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rationalreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon theincertitude of the void.Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?Not verbally. Substantially.What comforted his misapprehension?That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from theunknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodusfrom the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?Lighted Candle in Stickborne byBLOOMDiaconal Hat on Ashplantborne bySTEPHEN:With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?The th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israel de Egypto: domus Jacob depopulo barbaro.What did each do at the door of egress?Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?For a cat.What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest,emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere ofthe house into the penumbra of the garden?The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to hiscompanion of various constellations?Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible inincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginousscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observerplaced at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft  ft deep sunkfrom the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in CanisMaior)  lightyears (,,,, miles) distant and in volume times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession ofequinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascentnew stars such as Nova in : of our system plunging towards theconstellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalledfixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remoteeons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years,threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis ofinfinitesimal brevity.Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of theearth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed incavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, ofmicrobes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculabletrillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained bycohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe ofhuman serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universesof void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity,its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was againdivisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends anddivisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progresswere carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?Because some years previously in  when occupied with the problem ofthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of .the existence of a numbercomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of somany places, e.g., the th power of the th power of , that, the resulthaving been obtained,  closely printed volumes of  pages each ofinnumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to berequisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers ofunits, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of thenebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentialityof being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of itspowers.Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and theirsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moralredemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of  tons, whenelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere sufferedwith arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line ofdemarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximatedfrom nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposingthis problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesiswhich could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differentlyanatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise underMartian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uraniansufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beingscreated in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to thewhole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterablyand inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all thatis vanity.And the problem of possible redemption?The minor was proved by the major.Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow,crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudesrevealed up to and including the th: their positions: the waggoners star:Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn:the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrationsof double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, SimonMarius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attemptedby Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times ofrevolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and theirvast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion:the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about theperiod of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence ofmeteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, loAugust): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the oldmoon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: theappearance of a star (st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating bynight and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision andamalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about theperiod of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbentneversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (nd magnitude) ofsimilar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in anddisappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about theperiod of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably)similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in anddisappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of thebirth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga someyears after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and fromother constellations some years before or after the birth or death of otherpersons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, fromimmersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity ofwinged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals,persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor ofhuman beings.His (Blooms) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowingfor possible error?That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not aheavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from theknown to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by thesuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and ofdifferent magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a presentbefore its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in thedelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejectioninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satelliteof their planet.Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrologicalinfluences upon sublunary disasters?It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and thenomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable toverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea ofrains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon andwoman?Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations:her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminaryreflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by herappointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect:her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency overeffluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to investwith beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquilinscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominantimplacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: thestimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of hercraters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: herattraction, when invisible.What visible luminous sign attracted Blooms, who attracted Stephens,gaze?In the second storey (rere) of his (Blooms) house the light of a paraffin oillamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied byFrank OHara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shuttermanufacturer,  Aungier street.How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wifeMarion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subduedaffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: withsuggestion.Both then were silent?Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal fleshof theirhisnothis fellowfaces.Were they indefinitely inactive?At Stephens suggestion, at Blooms instigation both, first Stephen, thenBloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs ofmicturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, theirgazes, first Blooms, then Stephens, elevated to the projected luminous andsemiluminous shadow.Similarly?The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations weredissimilar: Blooms longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of thebifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at HighSchool () had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitudeagainst the whole concurrent strength of the institution,  scholars:Stephens higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previousday had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.What different problems presented themselves to each concerning theinvisible audible collateral organ of the other?To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (IJanuary, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessaryservile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnalbridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved inCalcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree oflatria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair andtoenails.What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament fromVega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress ofBerenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstablefemale lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning itswards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inwardspasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture forfree egress and free ingress.How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base,the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming anyangle less than the sum of two right angles.What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells inthe church of Saint George.What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?By Stephen:Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.By Bloom:Heigho, heigho,Heigho, heigho.Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom thatday at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the southto Glasnevin in the north?Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (inbed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (inbed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).Alone, what did Bloom hear?The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, thedouble vibration of a jews harp in the resonant lane.Alone, what did Bloom feel?The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point orthe absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the incipientintimations of proximate dawn.Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: PercyApjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, JervisStreet hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay),Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, MaterMisericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, theapparition of a new solar disk.Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?Once, in , after a protracted performance of charades in the house ofLuke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of thediurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction ofMizrach, the east.He remembered the initial paraphenomena?More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at variouspoints, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visiblediffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb ofthe resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.Did he remain?With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering thepassage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle,reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor,and reentered.What suddenly arrested his ingress?The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came intocontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensiblefraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence ofantecedent sensations transmitted and registered.Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles offurniture.A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite thedoor to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alterationwhich he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checkerinlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the placevacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angleof which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from itsposition beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous positionin front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of theingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checkerinlaid majolicatopped table.Describe them.One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slantedto the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringeof a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat acentralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slendersplayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former,its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished darkbrown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.What significances attached to these two chairs?Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantialevidence, of testimonial supermanence.What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffinsupporting a pair of long yellow ladies gloves and an emerald ashtraycontaining four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and twodiscoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the keyof G natural for voice and piano of Loves Old Sweet Song (words by G.Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam AntoinetteSterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte,pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close.With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple acontused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dullpassive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending anddownturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering DrMalachi Mulligans scheme of colour containing the gradation of green:with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceivingthrough various channels of internal sensibility the consequent andconcomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.His next proceeding?From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a blackdiminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a smalltin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece,produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated)entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially,rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it whenignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage ofrutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposingits unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.What followed this operation?The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted avertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on themantelpiece?A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of. a.m. on the  March , matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: adwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade,matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl,matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects andBloom?In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of thedwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before themirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clearmelancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloomwhile Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionatedgaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted hisattention?The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.Why solitary (ipsorelative)?Brothers and sisters had he none.Yet that mans father was his grandfathers son.Why mutable (aliorelative)?From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. Frommaturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternalprocreator.What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged andnot in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on thetwo bookshelves opposite.Catalogue these books.Thoms Dublin Post Office Directory, .Denis Florence MCarthys Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark atp. ).Shakespeares Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).The Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth).The Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled binding).The Childs Guide (blue cloth).The Beauties of Killarney (wrappers).When We Were Boys by William OBrien M.

He unbuttonedsuccessively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest alongthe medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangularconvergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomenand umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection ofthe sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles andterminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left,on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successivelyeach of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of whichone incomplete.What involuntary actions followed?He compressed between  fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in theleft infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted weeks and  days previously ( May ) by a bee. He scratchedimprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, variouspoints and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin.

process of divestiture continue?Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his footto one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient pointscaused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in severaldifferent directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhookedand loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time,detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of whichthe nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and,having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock,placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, pickedat and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised thepart lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, withsatisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.Why with satisfaction?Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of

Loyal to the highest constitutedpower in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would bethe strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abusesthough not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchmentbeing a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the finalsolution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and lawmerchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting incontravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass andpetty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, allorotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators ofinternational animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, allrecalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in  he had divulged hisdisbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his fatherRudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the Israeliticfaith and communion in  by the Society for promoting Christianityamong the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Romancatholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in .

Because attraction between agent(s) andreagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase anddecrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Becausethe controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, ifdesired, a fluctuation of pleasure.Abnegation?In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September  in the establishmentof George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter,  Eden Quay, b) hospitalityextended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person,c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity,colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction,intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincialmusical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.Equanimity?As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed orunderstood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordancewith his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not socalamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of acollision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery,cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences,forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal ofpublic trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel,blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the highseas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertionfrom armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence withthe kings enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilfuland premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other parallelprocesses of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in areciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendantcircumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations,significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought butoutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimoniallyviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of theadulterously violated.What retribution, if any?Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel bycombat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automaticbed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit fordamages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuriessustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral influencepossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material,a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent ofintimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting theone separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void ofincertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility ofthe thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between theselfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and theselfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferreddebility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethicalcodes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving noalteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculinesubject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminineobject) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preteriteproposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabiconomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in thepassive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: thecontinual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph orprotest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy ofnescient matter: the apathy of the stars.In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections,reduced to their simplest forms, converge?Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres,in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of themidnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land ofpromise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent ofmilk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscentof secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods ofimpression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutablemature animality.The visible signs of antesatisfaction?An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: atentative revelation: a silent contemplation.Then?He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on eachplump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscureprolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.The visible signs of postsatisfaction?A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: asolicitous aversion: a proximate erection.What followed this silent action?Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,catechetical interrogation.With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence betweenMartha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in thevicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, , and  Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response theretocaused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmerof Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, , , ,  South King street, aninvitation to supper at Wynns (Murphys) Hotel, ,  and  LowerAbbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituledSweets of Sin, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporaryconcussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of apostcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) beingStephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of SimonDedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him(narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and authoraforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?Absolutely.Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights wereperceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the courseof this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had beencelebrated  calendar month after the th anniversary of her birth (September ), viz.  October, and consummated on the same date withfemale issue born  June , having been anticipatorily consummated onthe lo September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, withejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last takenplace  weeks previous, viz.  November , to the birth on December  of second (and only male) issue, deceased  January ,aged  days, there remained a period of  years,  months and  daysduring which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculationof semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation ofactivity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercoursebetween himself and the listener had not taken place since theconsummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of thefemale issue of narrator and listener,  September , there remained aperiod of  months and  day during which, in consequence of apreestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between theconsummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty ofaction had been circumscribed.How?By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculinedestination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration forwhich, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projectedor effected.What moved visibly above the listeners and the narrators invisiblethoughts?The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series ofconcentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.In what directions did listener and narrator lie?Listener, S.

big stupoes I ever met and thats called asolicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not thatits some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on thesly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterdayhe was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to showhim Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered itup with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so veryprobably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him becauseall men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he isnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool andthen the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two strawsnow who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find outso long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like thatslut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom toexcite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him onceor twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found thelong hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchenpretending he was drinking water  woman is not enough for them it wasall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat atour table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my housestealing my potatoes and the oysters / per doz going out to see her aunt ifyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something onwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have noproof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I toldher what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her Iwouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room theFriday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her faceswelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw tothat better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker onlyfor the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhoweither she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought hewas with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to myface and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she wastoo well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so hemust do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was itthe night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka inmy hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with mythumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming lovebecause he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Imdining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him thesatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be alwaysand ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to doit since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a littlealone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and makehim turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with thatdown on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hourquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalmanyes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishopwas sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting thatwoollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about themonuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making himworse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking ofwho is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yesimagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of mewhat he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simplyruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it tillhe comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips paleanyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about itpeople make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it andthink no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going andmarrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way sonice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other wouldtake me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothinglike a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hatethat confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me fatherand what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool butwhereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yesrather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottomright out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did youwhatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the realfather what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God hehad a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neitherwould he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know mein the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turnor let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a womanof course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to beembraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like thepope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too carefulabout himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonderwas he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind goingaway so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass amI I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking ofme or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought hesmelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kindof paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip thoserichlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnniesdrink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of thatAmerican that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all hecould do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we tookthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovelyand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I poppedstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thoughtthe heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myselfand said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if theworld was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no Godwhat could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only makean act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars streetchapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if heheard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul youhave no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is tohave one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come  or  timeswith that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein orwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is notso big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hoursdressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thickcrowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a fewdozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone hadone the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a wholesheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middleof us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they wantout of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut myeyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I madehim pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better incase any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it inme nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but ifsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I wentthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and MinaPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with achild or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell ofchildren off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger witha shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was therea squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear yourears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out likeelephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not offhim though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but Idont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly Isuppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about meand Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do himany good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he wasdancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsonshousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was onaccount of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had thestandup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lordbeing a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitiveabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for Iknew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyedme so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedupthings especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study upthat myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could alwayshear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after thatI pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be abit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I saidover to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and thethree pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him tomake it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her againand was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat theonions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouseor touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would sendthem all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she ofcourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with himthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love himand look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine hewas and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner likehe did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though Iliked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for theasking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I wasrolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I puthim off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pastyflour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so Ididnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to bealways embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of courseglauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possibleasking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on tothat putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking abit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kindhe is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was veryhandsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked thoughhe was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engagedafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughingwith the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one afteranother with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she saidyes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used totell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough tomake her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the doormuch after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after livingwith that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawnand run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a rowwith him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down aconversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down whatwas it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with hismuddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get intobed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a manwell its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he doesalways wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and alwaysblacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes upin the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like thatsimply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his bootsoff now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die  times overthan marry another of their sex of course hed never find another womanlike me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yesand he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrickthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other manyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do athing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive youmad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marrythem for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get onwithout us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonderwhy they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us aswise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the otherfellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was hernature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang awoman surely are theytheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot henoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B Cwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we bothordered  teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his twoold maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was whatdo I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he mademe buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself alwayswith some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot mysuede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of awoman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladieslavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I sawhis eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was lookingwhen I looked back and I went there for tea  days after in the hope but hewasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when wewere in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk inmy hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month anice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my footso much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwinsbotchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in thehouse to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off mystockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time itwas my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could findbut of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did hesay I could give  points in  to Katty Lanner and beat her what does thatmean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition justpassed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite Ithink I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting thebutter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of whenhe commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AveMaria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow andpart which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too mylow notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the wayhe used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in aplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him aboutthat some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show himthe very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinksnothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about mymother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as hedid he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bitcut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth squarehe kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking mequestions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let himkeep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into hispocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seenalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirtsblowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at theopen air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun sohe could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind followingin the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner ofthe Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in theZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat lookingslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they cango and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it andwere not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you whereare you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes onmy neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting toowarm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes tillI took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves weretoo cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear medrawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pairoff my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he didlook a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made mehungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat Ihad on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneeldown in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his newraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre sosavage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched histrousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keephim from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out washe circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everythingtoo quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all thetime for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and hadto go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all thosewords in it how could he have the face to any woman after his companymanners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have Ioffended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a fewbrains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking ortearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knewwhat it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand youI said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up witha picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt findanywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morninga letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knewthe way to take a woman when he sent me the  big poppies because minewas the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn Icouldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but henever knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Mondayas he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answerthe door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you allundressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day

real old gent in his wayit was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have topeep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was aputoff first him sending the

permission and standing out that vulgar way in the halfof a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those oldhypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in hisway to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with whatwith a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an oldLion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and temptingin my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its wellfor men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were soround and white for them always I

cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my auntMary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl waspassing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and heputs his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to beyou put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick andchoose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for theirdifferent tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to bealways chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fearonce I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we allremain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out whatthey did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronadoanyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme aboutthe wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thoughton the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her whatelse were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Imyoung still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my timeliving with him so cold

young no matter bywho so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you wantisnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around bythe quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up asailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was onlydo it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies inRathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to tryand steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for thename model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones oddstockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switchattack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or amurderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silkhats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lanethe night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxingmatch of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and thewalk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a womanafter coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to hiswife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again withdisease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listento him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh thegreat Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on thecards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in someperplexity between  s too in prison for

sheknows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for usthey dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could theywhere would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother

poor case that those that have afine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make oneit wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up inher behind in the

Gutenberg Etext of Ulyssesby James JoyceThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtoniansfor tea, sympathy, and a sofaFar out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  ofthe  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregardedyellow sun.Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  milesis  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  stillthink digital watches are a pretty neat idea.This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: mostof  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of thesewere  largely  concerned with the movements of small green piecesof paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasnt  the  smallgreen pieces of paper that were unhappy.And so the problem remained; lots of the people  were  mean,  andmost of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.Many were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a  bigmistake  in  coming  down  from the trees in the first place. Andsome said that even the trees had been a bad move,  and  that  noone should ever have left the oceans.And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after  one  manhad  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to benice to people for a change, one girl sitting on  her  own  in  asmall  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was thathad been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how  theworld  could  be  made  a  good and happy place. This time it wasright, it would work, and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  toanything.Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone  to  tell  anyone-about  it,  a  terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the ideawas lost forever.This is not her story.But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and  someof its consequences.It is also the story of a book, a book called The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to  the  Galaxy  -  not  an Earth book, never published onEarth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen orheard of by any Earthman.Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come outof  the  great  publishing  houses  of  Ursa  Minor - of which noEarthman had ever heard either.Not only is it a wholly remarkable book,  it  is  also  a  highlysuccessful  one  -  more  popular  than  the  Celestial Home CareOmnibus, better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  ZeroGravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphids trilogy ofphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went  Wrong,  Some  More  ofGods Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?In many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the  Outer  EasternRim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hikers Guide has already supplantedthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the  standard  repository  ofall  knowledge  and  wisdom, for though it has many omissions andcontains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly  inaccurate,it  scores  over the older, more pedestrian work in two importantrespects.First, it is slightly cheaper; and  secondly  it  has  the  wordsDont Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of itsextraordinary   consequences,   and   the  story   of  how  theseconsequences are inextricably intertwined  with  this  remarkablebook begins very simply.It begins with a house.The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.It  stood  on  its  own  and  looked  over a broad spread of WestCountry farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means  -  it  wasabout  thirty  years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, andhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion  whichmore or less exactly failed to please the eye.The only person for whom the house was in  any  way  special  wasArthur  Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the onehe lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever sincehe  had  moved  out  of  London  because  it made him nervous andirritable. He was about thirty as well,  dark  haired  and  never-quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him mostwas the fact that people always used  to  ask  him  what  he  waslooking  so  worried  about.  He  worked  in local radio which healways used to tell his friends was a lot more  interesting  thanthey  probably  thought. It was, too - most of his friends workedin advertising.It hadnt properly registered with Arthur that the council wantedto knock down his house and build an bypass instead.At eight oclock on Thursday  morning  Arthur  didnt  feel  verygood.  He  woke  up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round hisroom, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his  slippers,  andstomped off to the bathroom to wash.Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it.  For  amoment  it  reflected  a  second  bulldozer  through the bathroomwindow. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur  Dents  bristles.He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchento find something pleasant to put in his mouth.Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.The word bulldozer wandered through his  mind  for  a  moment  insearch of something to connect with.The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.He stared at it."Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom  to  getdressed.Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of  water,and  another.  He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why washe hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He  supposedthat  he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror."Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the  pub.  Hevaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemedimportant. Hed been telling  people  about  it,  telling  peopleabout  it  at  great  length,  he  rather suspected: his clearestvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other peoples  faces.Something  about a new bypass he had just found out about. It hadbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have  knownabout  it.  Ridiculous.  He  took  a swig of water. It would sortitself out, hed decided, no one wanted  a  bypass,  the  councildidnt have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out.God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He  lookedat  himself  in  the  wardrobe  mirror.  He stuck out his tongue."Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through  his  mindin search of something to connect with.Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in  frontof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he  wasa carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specificallyhe was forty, fat and shabby and worked for  the  local  council.Curiously  enough, though he didnt know it, he was also a directmale-line  descendant  of  Genghis   Khan,   though   interveninggenerations  and  racial  mixing had so juggled his genes that hehad  no  discernible  Mongoloid  characteristics,  and  the  onlyvestiges  left  in  Mr  L  Prosser  of his mighty ancestry were apronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for  littlefur hats.He was by no means a great warrior: in  fact  he  was  a  nervousworried  man.  Today  he  was  particularly  nervous  and worriedbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job  -  whichwas  to  see  that Arthur Dents house got cleared out of the waybefore the day was out."Come off it, Mr Dent,", he said, "you cant win  you  know.  Youcant  lie  in  front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried tomake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldnt do it.Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him."Im game," he said, "well see who rusts first.""Im afraid youre going to have to accept it," said  Mr  Prossergripping  his  fur  hat and rolling it round the top of his head,"this bypass has got to be built and its going to be built!""First Ive heard of it," said Arthur,  "whys  it  going  to  bebuilt?"Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit,  then  stopped  andput it away again."What do you mean, whys it got to be built?" he  said.  "Its  abypass. Youve got to build bypasses."Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from  pointA  to  point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B topoint A very fast. People  living  at  point  C,  being  a  pointdirectly  in  between,  are often given to wonder whats so greatabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen  to  getthere,  and  whats so great about point B that so many people ofpoint A are so keen to get there. They  often  wish  that  peoplewould  just  once and for all work out where the hell they wantedto be.Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D  wasnt  anywhere  inparticular, it was just any convenient point a very long way frompoints A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage  at  pointD,  with  axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of timeat point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.  His  wifeof  course  wanted  climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didntknow why - he  just  liked  axes.  He  flushed  hotly  under  thederisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.He shifted his weight from foot  to  foot,  but  it  was  equallyuncomfortable  on  each.  Obviously somebody had been appallinglyincompetent and he hoped to God it wasnt him.Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestionsor protests at the appropriate time you know.""Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first Iknew  about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. Iasked him if hed come to clean the windows and he said  no  hedcome  to  demolish  the house. He didnt tell me straight away ofcourse. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged  mea fiver. Then he told me.""But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planningoffice for the last nine month.""Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went  straight  round  to  seethem,  yesterday  afternoon.  You hadnt exactly gone out of yourway to call attention to them  had  you?  I  mean  like  actuallytelling anybody or anything.""But the plans were on display ...""On display? I eventually had to go down to the  cellar  to  findthem.""Thats the display department.""With a torch.""Ah, well the lights had probably gone.""So had the stairs.""But look, you found the notice didnt you?""Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in  the  bottomof  a  locked  filing  cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with asign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard."A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as  helay  propped  up  on  his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadowover Arthur Dents house. Mr Prosser frowned at it."Its not as if its a particularly nice house," he said."Im sorry, but I happen to like it.""Youll like the bypass.""Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go  away,  and  takeyour  bloody  bypass  with you. You havent got a leg to stand onand you know it."Mr Prossers mouth opened and closed a couple of times while  hismind  was  for  a  moment  filled  with inexplicable but terriblyattractive visions of Arthur Dents  house  being  consumed  withfire  and  Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruinwith at least three hefty spears protruding  from  his  back.  MrProsser  was often bothered with visions like these and they madehim feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then  pulledhimself together."Mr Dent," he said."Hello? Yes?" said Arthur."Some factual information for you. Have you  any  idea  how  muchdamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straightover you?""How much?" said Arthur."None at  all,"  said  Mr  Prosser,  and  stormed  nervously  offwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemenall shouting at him.By a curious  coincidence,  None  at  all  is  exactly  how  muchsuspicion  the  ape-descendant  Arthur  Dent  had that one of hisclosest friends was not descended from an ape, but  was  in  factfrom  a  small  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not fromGuildford as he usually claimed.Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.This friend of his had first arrived on the planet  some  fifteenEarth  years  previously, and he had worked hard to blend himselfinto Earth society - with, it must be  said,  some  success.  Forinstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an outof work actor, which was plausible enough.He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped abit  on his preparatory research. The information he had gatheredhad led him to choose the name "Ford  Prefect"  as  being  nicelyinconspicuous.He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but notconspicuously  handsome.  His  hair  was  wiry  and gingerish andbrushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be  pulledbackwards  from  the  nose. There was something very slightly oddabout him, but it was difficult to say what it  was.  Perhaps  itwas  that  his eyes didnt blink often enough and when you talkedto him for any length of time your eyes  began  involuntarily  towater  on  his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly toobroadly and gave people the  unnerving  impression  that  he  wasabout to go for their neck.He struck most of  the  friends  he  had  made  on  Earth  as  aneccentric,  but  a  harmless  one  --  an unruly boozer with someoddish habits. For instance he would often  gatecrash  universityparties,   get   badly   drunk   and  start  making  fun  of  anyastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.Sometimes he would get seized with  oddly  distracted  moods  andstare  into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him whathe was doing. Then he would start guiltily for  a  moment,  relaxand grin."Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyonewould  laugh  and  ask  him  what  sort  of flying saucers he waslooking for."Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly fora  moment  and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy anenormous round of drinks.Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of hisskull  on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explainto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the  flyingsaucers didnt matter that much really.Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night  streets  hewould  often  ask  passing  policemen  if  they  knew  the way toBetelgeuse. The  policemen  would  usually  say  something  like,"Dont you think its about time you went off home sir?""Im trying to baby, Im trying  to,"  is  what  Ford  invariablyreplied on these occasions.In fact what he  was  really  looking  out  for  when  he  stareddistractedly  into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer atall. The reason he said green was that green was the  traditionalspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer  at  all  wouldarrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get strandedanywhere, particularly somewhere as  mindboggingly  dull  as  theEarth.Ford wished that a flying saucer would  arrive  soon  because  heknew  how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. Heknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than  thirtyAltairan dollars a day.In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving  researcher  for  that  whollyremarkable book The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy.Human beings are great adaptors, and by  lunchtime  life  in  theenvirons  of Arthurs house had settled into a steady routine. Itwas Arthurs accepted role to lie squelching in  the  mud  makingoccasional  demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book;it was Mr Prossers accepted  role  to  tackle  Arthur  with  theoccasional  new  ploy  such  as the For the Public Good talk, theMarch of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down  Once  YouKnow,  Never  Looked  Back  talk and various other cajoleries andthreats; and it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role  to  sitaround  drinking  coffee and experimenting with union regulationsto see how they could  turn  the  situation  to  their  financialadvantage.The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.A shadow moved across him again."Hello Arthur," said the shadow.Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled  to  seeFord Prefect standing above him."Ford! Hello, how are you?""Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?""Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, Ive  just  got  all  thesebulldozers and things to lie in front of because theyll knock myhouse down if I dont, but other  than  that  ...  well,  no  notespecially, why?"They dont have sarcasm on Betelgeuse,  and  Ford  Prefect  oftenfailed  to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good,is there anywhere we can talk?""What?" said Arthur Dent.For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and  stared  fixedlyinto  the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Thensuddenly he squatted down beside Arthur."Weve got to talk," he said urgently."Fine," said Arthur, "talk.""And drink," said Ford. "Its vitally important that we talk  anddrink. Now. Well go to the pub in the village."He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant."Look, dont you  understand?"  shouted  Arthur.  He  pointed  atProsser. "That man wants to knock my house down!"Ford glanced at him, puzzled."Well he can do it while youre away cant he?" he asked."But I dont want him to!""Ah.""Look, whats the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur."Nothing. Nothings the matter. Listen to me - Ive got  to  tellyou  the most important thing youve ever heard. Ive got to tellyou now, and Ive got to tell you in the saloon bar of the  Horseand Groom.""But why?""Because you are going to need a very stiff drink."Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that hiswill  was  beginning  to  weaken. He didnt realize that this wasbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in  thehyperspace  ports  that  served the madranite mining belts in thestar system of Orion Beta.The game was not unlike the Earth game called  Indian  Wrestling,and was played like this:Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass infront of each of them.Between them  would  be  placed  a  bottle  of  Janx  Spirit  (asimmortalized  in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh dont give menone more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, dont  you  give  me  nonemore  of  that  Old  Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tonguewill lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Wont you pour  me  onemore of that sinful Old Janx Spirit").Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will  onthe  bottle  and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glassof his opponent - who would then have to drink it.The bottle would then be  refilled.  The  game  would  be  playedagain. And again.Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing,  becauseone  of  the  effects  of  Janx  spirit is to depress telepsychicpower.As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the  finalloser  would  have  to  perform  a  forfeit,  which  was  usuallyobscenely biological.Ford Prefect usually played to lose.Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think  that  perhaps  he  didwant to go to the Horse and Groom after all."But what about my house ...?" he asked plaintively.Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a  wicked  thoughtstruck him."He wants to knock your house down?""Yes, he wants to build ...""And he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozers?""Yes, and ...""Im sure we can come to some arrangement,"  said  Ford.  "Excuseme!" he shouted.Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman  for  the  bulldozerdrivers  about  whether  or  not Arthur Dent constituted a mentalhealth hazard, and how much they  should  get  paid  if  he  did)looked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find thatArthur had company."Yes? Hello?" he called. "Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?""Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasnt?""Well?" sighed Mr Prosser."And can we also assume," said  Ford,  "that  hes  going  to  bestaying here all day?""So?""So all your men are going to be standing around  all  day  doingnothing?""Could be, could be ...""Well, if  youre  resigned  to  doing  that  anyway,  you  dontactually need him to lie here all the time do you?""What?""You dont," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here."Mr Prosser thought about this."Well no, not as  such...",  he  said,  "not  exactly  need  ..."Prosser  was worried. He thought that one of them wasnt making alot of sense.Ford said, "So if you would just like to take  it  as  read  thathes  actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pubfor half an hour. How does that sound?"Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty."That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring  toneof voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure."And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself  later  on,"said Ford, "we can always cover up for you in return.""Thank you very much," said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how  toplay  this  at  all,  "thank you very much, yes, thats very kind..." He frowned, then smiled, then tried  to  do  both  at  once,failed,  grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully roundthe top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won."So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would  just  like  to  comeover here and lie down ...""What?" said Mr Prosser."Ah, Im sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadnt made  myself  fullyclear.  Somebodys  got to lie in front of the bulldozers haventthey? Or there wont be anything to stop  them  driving  into  MrDents house will there?""What?" said Mr Prosser again."Its very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr Dent, says that  hewill  stop  lying  here in the mud on the sole condition that youcome and take over from him.""What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but  Ford  nudged  himwith his shoe to be quiet."You want me," said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought  tohimself, "to come and lie there ...""Yes.""In front of the bulldozer?""Yes.""Instead of Mr Dent.""Yes.""In the mud.""In, as you say it, the mud."As soon as Mr Prosser realized  that  he  was  substantially  theloser  after  all,  it  was  as if a weight lifted itself off hisshoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed."In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down  to  thepub?""Thats it," said Ford. "Thats it exactly."Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped."Promise?""Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur."Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down."Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat  down  in  themud.  He  felt  that his whole life was some kind of dream and hesometimes wondered whose it was and whether  they  were  enjoyingit. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozedinto his shoes.Ford looked at him severely."And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dents house  whilst  hes  away,alright?" he said."The mere thought," growled Mr Prosser,  "hadnt  even  begun  tospeculate,"  he  continued,  settling  himself  back,  "about themerest possibility of crossing my mind."He saw the bulldozer drivers  union  representative  approachingand  let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying tomarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now  constitutea  mental  health  hazard  himself. He was far from certain aboutthis - his mind seemed to be full of noise,  horses,  smoke,  andthe  stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserableand put upon, and he  had  never  been  able  to  explain  it  tohimself.  In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mightyKhan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser  only  trembled  slightlyand whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind theeyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups,  angry  men  lying  in  the  mud,indecipherable  strangers  handing  out inexplicable humiliationsand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his  head- what a day.What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didnt  matter  a  pair  ofdingos  kidneys  whether  Arthurs house got knocked down or notnow.Arthur remained very worried."But can we trust him?" he said."Myself Id trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford."Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how fars that?""About twelve minutes away,"  said  Ford,  "come  on,  I  need  adrink."Heres what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about  alcohol.It  says  that  alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed bythe fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effecton certain carbon-based life forms.The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy also mentions  alcohol.  Itsays  that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic GargleBlaster.It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is  likehaving  your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped rounda large gold brick.The Guide also tells you on which planets the best  Pan  GalacticGargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for oneand what voluntary organizations exist to help  you  rehabilitateafterwards.The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol Janx Spirit, it says.Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus  V-  Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santragineanfish!!!Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into  the  mixture(it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through  it,  inmemory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in theMarshes of Fallia.Over the back of a silver spoon  float  a  measure  of  QualactinHypermint  extract,  redolent of all the heady odours of the darkQualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.Drop in the tooth of an Algolian  Suntiger.  Watch  it  dissolve,spreading  the  fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart ofthe drink.Sprinkle Zamphuor.Add an olive.Drink ... but ... very carefully ...The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy sells  rather  better  thanthe Encyclopedia Galactica."Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to  the  barman  of  theHorse and Groom. "And quickly please, the worlds about to end."The barman of the Horse and Groom didnt  deserve  this  sort  oftreatment,  he  was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses uphis nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and staredout  of  the  window,  so the barman looked instead at Arthur whoshrugged helplessly and said nothing.So the barman said, "Oh  yes  sir?  Nice  weather  for  it,"  andstarted pulling pints.He tried again."Going to watch the match this afternoon then?"Ford glanced round at him."No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window."Whats that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said  thebarman. "Arsenal without a chance?""No, no," said Ford, "its just that the worlds about to end.""Oh yes sir, so you said," said  the  barman,  looking  over  hisglasses  this  time  at  Arthur.  "Lucky escape for Arsenal if itdid."Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised."No, not really," he said. He frowned.The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir,  six  pints,"he said.Arthur smiled at him wanly and  shrugged  again.  He  turned  andsmiled  wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them hadheard what was going on.None of them had, and none of them could understand what  he  wassmiling at them for.A man sitting next to Ford at the bar  looked  at  the  two  men,looked  at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic,arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid  hopeful  grinat them."Get off," said Ford, "Theyre ours,"  giving  him  a  look  thatwould have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing.Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar.  He  said,  "Keep  thechange.""What, from a fiver? Thank you sir.""Youve got ten minutes left to spend it."The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit."Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the  hell  isgoing on?""Drink up," said Ford, "youve got three pints to get through.""Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?"The man next to ford grinned and  nodded  happily.  Ford  ignoredhim. He said, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.""Very deep," said  Arthur,  "you  should  send  that  in  to  theReaders Digest. Theyve got a page for people like you.""Drink up.""Why three pints all of a sudden?""Muscle relaxant, youll need it.""Muscle relaxant?""Muscle relaxant."Arthur stared into his beer."Did I do anything wrong today,"  he  said,  "or  has  the  worldalways  been  like this and Ive been too wrapped up in myself tonotice?""Alright," said Ford, "Ill try to  explain.  How  long  have  weknown each other?""How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," hesaid. "Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time.""Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that Im notfrom  Guildford  after  all, but from a small planet somewhere inthe vicinity of Betelgeuse?"Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way."I dont know," he said, taking a pull of beer.  "Why  -  do  youthink its the sort of thing youre likely to say?"Ford gave up. It really wasnt worth  bothering  at  the  moment,what with the world being about to end. He just said:"Drink up."He added, perfectly factually:"The worlds about to end."Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile.  The  rest  ofthe  pub  frowned  at  him. A man waved at him to stop smiling atthem and mind his own business."This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to  himself,  sinkinglow over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly throughthe  ionosphere  many  miles  above  the  surface  of the planet;several somethings in fact,  several  dozen  huge  yellow  chunkyslablike  somethings,  huge as office buildings, silent as birds.They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays  from  thestar Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious  of  theirpresence,  which  was just how they wanted it for the moment. Thehuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly,  they  passedover  Cape  Canaveral  without  a  blip, Woomera and Jodrell Banklooked straight through them - which was a pity  because  it  wasexactly  the  sort  of  thing  theyd  been looking for all theseyears.The only place they registered at all was on a small black devicecalled  a  Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matic  which  winked  away quietly toitself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel whichFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck. The contents of FordPrefects satchel were quite interesting in fact and  would  havemade any Earth physicists eyes pop out of his head, which is whyhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scriptsfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic  and  the  scripts  he  had  anElectronic  Thumb - a short squat black rod, smooth and matt witha couple of flat switches and dials at one end;  he  also  had  adevice  which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.This had about a hundred tiny flat press  buttons  and  a  screenabout  four  inches  square on which any one of a million "pages"could be summoned  at  a  moments  notice.  It  looked  insanelycomplicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plasticcover it fitted into had the words Dont Panic printed on  it  inlarge friendly letters. The other reason was that this device wasin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of thegreat  publishing  corporations of Ursa Minor - The Hitch HikersGuide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the  formof  a  micro  sub  meson  electronic component is that if it wereprinted in normal book form, an interstellar  hitch  hiker  wouldrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it aroundin.Beneath that in Ford  Prefects  satchel  were  a  few  biros,  anotepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say  onthe subject of towels.A towel, it says, is about the most  massively  useful  thing  aninterstellar  hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practicalvalue - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound acrossthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliantmarble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling  the  heady  seavapours;  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine soredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it  to  sail  a  miniraft  down  the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes orto  avoid  the  gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (amindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you cant see it,it  cant  see  you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you canwave your towel in emergencies  as  a  distress  signal,  and  ofcourse  dry  yourself  off  with it if it still seems to be cleanenough.More importantly, a towel has immense  psychological  value.  Forsome reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that ahitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically  assumethat  he  is  also  in  possession of a toothbrush, face flannel,soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string,  gnatspray,  wet  weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, thestrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of  these  or  adozen  other  items  that the hitch hiker might accidentally have"lost". What the strag will think is that any man who  can  hitchthe length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggleagainst terrible odds, win through, and  still  knows  where  histowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking  slang,  as  in"Hey,  you  sass  that  hoopy  Ford  Prefect? Theres a frood whoreally knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet,have   sex  with;  hoopy:  really  together  guy;  frood:  reallyamazingly together guy.)Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford  Prefects  satchel,the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles abovethe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fanout.  At  Jodrell  Bank,  someone  decided it was time for a nicerelaxing cup of tea."You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him."Why? What, no  ...  should  I  have?"  He  had  given  up  beingsurprised, there didnt seem to be any point any longer.Ford clicked his tongue in irritation."Drink up," he urged.At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling  crash  from  outsidefiltered  through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound ofthe jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccuppingover the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet."Whats that?" he yelped."Dont worry," said Ford, "they havent started yet.""Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed."Its probably just your house being knocked  down,"  said  Ford,drowning his last pint."What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Fords spell was broken.  Arthurlooked wildly around him and ran to the window."My God they are! Theyre knocking my house down. What  the  hellam I doing in the pub, Ford?""It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said  Ford,  "letthem have their fun.""Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" He quickly checked out of the windowagain that they were talking about the same thing."Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran  out  of  the  pub  furiouslywaving  a  nearly  empty beer glass. He made no friends at all inthe pub that lunchtime."Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You  halfcrazed Visigoths, stop will you!"Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman heasked for four packets of peanuts."There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on thebar, "twenty-eight pence if youd be so kind."Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another  five-pound  noteand told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and thenlooked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a  momentarysensation  that  he didnt understand because no one on Earth hadever experienced it before. In moments  of  great  stress,  everylife  form  that  exists  gives  out a tiny sublimal signal. Thissignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense  ofhow far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it isnever possible to be further than  sixteen  thousand  miles  fromyour birthplace, which really isnt very far, so such signals aretoo minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this  moment  undergreat  stress,  and  he was born  light years away in the nearvicinity of Betelgeuse.The  barman  reeled  for   a   moment,   hit   by   a   shocking,incomprehensible sense of distance. He didnt know what it meant,but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almostawe."Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had  theeffect  of  silencing  the  pub.  "You think the worlds going toend?""Yes," said Ford."But, this afternoon?"Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest."Yes,"  he  said  gaily,  "in  less  than  two  minutes  I  wouldestimate."The barman couldnt believe the conversation he was  having,  buthe couldnt believe the sensation he had just had either."Isnt there anything we can do about it then?" he said."No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.Someone in the hushed  bar  suddenly  laughed  raucously  at  howstupid everyone had become.The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now.  His  eyeswaved their way up to Ford."I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we weremeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.""If you like, yes," said Ford."Thats what they told us in the army," said  the  man,  and  hiseyes began the long trek back down to his whisky."Will that help?" asked the barman."No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile.  "Excuse  me,"  hesaid, "Ive got to go." With a wave, he left.The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then,  embarrassinglyenough,  the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl hehad dragged along to the pub with him had  grown  to  loathe  himdearly  over the last hour or so, and it would probably have beena great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and  a  halfor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozoneand carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she  would  betoo busy evaporating herself to notice it.The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:"Last orders, please."The huge yellow machines began  to  sink  downward  and  to  movefaster.Ford knew they were there. This wasnt the way he had wanted it.Running up the lane, Arthur had  nearly  reached  his  house.  Hedidnt  notice  how cold it had suddenly become, he didnt noticethe wind, he didnt notice the sudden irrational squall of  rain.He didnt notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawlingover the rubble that had been his home."You barbarians!" he yelled. "Ill  sue  the  council  for  everypenny  its  got!  Ill  have  you hung, drawn and quartered! Andwhipped! And boiled ... until ...  until  ...  until  youve  hadenough."Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast."And then Ill do  it  again!"  yelled  Arthur.  "And  when  Ivefinished  I  will  take  all  the little bits, and I will jump onthem!"Arthur  didnt  notice  that  the  men  were  running  from   thebulldozers;   he  didnt  notice  that  Mr  Prosser  was  staringhectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser  had  noticed  was  thathuge   yellow  somethings  were  screaming  through  the  clouds.Impossibly huge yellow somethings."And I will carry on  jumping  on  them,"  yelled  Arthur,  stillrunning,  "until  I get blisters, or I can think of anything evenmore unpleasant to do, and then ..."Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on  hisback.  At last he noticed that something was going on. His fingershot upwards."What the hells that?" he shrieked.Whatever it was raced across the  sky  in  monstrous  yellowness,tore  the  sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off intothe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bangthat drove your ears six feet into your skull.Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.Its difficult to say exactly what the people on the  surface  ofthe  planet  were doing now, because they didnt really know whatthey were doing themselves. None of it made  a  lot  of  sense  -running  into  houses, running out of houses, howling noiselesslyat the noise. All around the world  city  streets  exploded  withpeople, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them andthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, desertsand oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.Only one man stood and  watched  the  sky,  stood  with  terriblesadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactlywhat was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matic  had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillarand woken him with a start. It was what he  had  waited  for  allthese  years,  but  when  he  had  deciphered  the signal patternsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had  gripped  himand squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy whocould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought,didnt it just have to be the Vogons.Still he knew what he had to do.  As  the  Vogon  craft  screamedthrough  the  air  high above him he opened his satchel. He threwaway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor  Dreamcoat,  hethrew away a copy of Godspell: He wouldnt need them where he wasgoing. Everything was ready, everything was prepared.He knew where his towel was.A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than thenoise. For a while nothing happened.The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation  onEarth.  Motionless  they  hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, ablasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock astheir  minds  tried  to  encompass what they were looking at. Theships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks dont.And still nothing happened.Then there was a slight whisper, a  sudden  spacious  whisper  ofopen  ambient  sound.  Every hi fi set in the world, every radio,every television, every cassette recorder,  every  woofer,  everytweeter,  every  mid-range  driver  in  the  world quietly turneditself on.Every tin can, every dust bin, every  window,  every  car,  everywine  glass,  every  sheet  of rusty metal became activated as anacoustically perfect sounding board.Before the Earth passed away it was going to be  treated  to  thevery  ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public addresssystem ever built.  But  there  was  no  concert,  no  music,  nofanfare, just a simple message."People of Earth, your attention please," a voice  said,  and  itwas   wonderful.   Wonderful   perfect  quadrophonic  sound  withdistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep."This is  Prostetnic  Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic  HyperspacePlanning  Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt beaware, the plans for development of the outlying regions  of  theGalaxy  require  the  building  of  a  hyperspatial express routethrough your star system, and regrettably your planet is  one  ofthose  scheduled  for  demolition. The process will take slightlyless that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you."The PA died away.Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people  of  Earth.The  terror  moved  slowly through the gathered crowds as if theywere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a  magnet  was  movingbeneath  them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, butthere was nowhere to flee to.Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:"Theres no point in acting  all  surprised  about  it.  All  theplanning  charts  and  demolition  orders have been on display inyour local planning department on Alpha  Centauri  for  fifty  ofyour  Earth  years,  so  youve  had  plenty of time to lodge anyformal complaint and its far too late to  start  making  a  fussabout it now."The PA fell silent again and its  echo  drifted  off  across  theland. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. Onthe underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.By  this  time  somebody  somewhere  must  have  manned  a  radiotransmitter,  located a wavelength and broadcasted a message backto the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody everheard  what  they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammedback into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said:"What do you mean  youve  never  been  to  Alpha  Centauri?  Forheavens  sake mankind, its only four light years away you know.Im sorry, but if you cant be bothered to take  an  interest  inlocal affairs thats your own lookout."Energize the demolition beams."Light poured out into the hatchways."I dont know," said the  voice  on  the  PA,  "apathetic  bloodyplanet, Ive no sympathy at all." It cut off.There was a terrible ghastly silence.There was a terrible ghastly noise.There was a terrible ghastly silence.The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away  into  the  inky  starryvoid.Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy,  five  hundredthousand  light  years  from  the  star  Sol,  Zaphod Beeblebrox,President of the Imperial Galactic Government,  sped  across  theseas  of  Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashingin the Damogran sun.Damogran the  hot;  Damogran  the  remote;  Damogran  the  almosttotally unheard of.Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.The boat sped on across the water. It would be some  time  beforeit   reached   its   destination  because  Damogran  is  such  aninconveniently  arranged  planet.  It  consists  of  nothing  butmiddling  to  large  desert  islands separated by very pretty butannoyingly wide stretches of ocean.The boat sped on.Because of  this  topological  awkwardness  Damogran  has  alwaysremained  a  deserted  planet.  This is why the Imperial GalacticGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project,  becauseit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.The boat zipped and skipped across the  sea,  the  sea  that  laybetween  the  main  islands of the only archipelago of any usefulsize on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his  way  fromthe  tiny  spaceport  on  Easter Island (the name was an entirelymeaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke,  easter  means  smallflat  and  light  brown)  to  the  Heart of Gold island, which byanother meaningless coincidence was called France.One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a  wholestring of pretty meaningless coincidences.But it was not in any way a coincidence that today,  the  day  ofculmination  of  the project, the great day of unveiling, the daythat the Heart  of  Gold  was  finally  to  be  introduced  to  amarvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for ZaphodBeeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day  that  he  had  firstdecided  to  run  for  the  Presidency, a decision which had sentwaves of astonishment throughout the  Imperial  Galaxy  -  ZaphodBeeblebrox?   President?  Not  the  Zaphod  Beeblebrox?  Not  thePresident? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that  the  wholeof known creation had finally gone bananas.Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.Zaphod Beeblebrox,  adventurer,  ex-hippy,  good  timer,  (crook?quite  possibly),  manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personalrelationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.President?No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle  onwhich  the  Galaxy  was  governed, and they knew that once ZaphodBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it wasmore  or  less  a  fait  accompli:  he  was  the ideal Presidencyfodder*.What they completely failed to  understand  was  why  Zaphod  wasdoing it.He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize whatZaphod  had  been  up  to.  Today  was  what  Zaphod BeeblebroxsPresidency was all  about.  Today  was  also  his  two  hundredthbirthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.As he skipped his boat across the  seas  of  Damogran  he  smiledquietly  to  himself  about  what a wonderful exciting day it wasgoing to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across theseat back. He steered with an extra arm hed recently fitted justbeneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing."Hey," he cooed to himself, "youre a real cool boy you." But hisnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.The island of France was about  twenty  miles  long,  five  milesacross  the  middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemedto exist not so much as an island in its own right  as  simply  ameans  of  defining  the  sweep  and  curve  of  a huge bay. Thisimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline ofthe  crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From thetop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five  miles  to  theopposite shore.On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.It consisted in large part of the engineers and  researchers  whohad built the Heart of Gold - mostly humanoid, but here and therewere a few reptiloid atomineers, two or  three  green  slyph-likemaximegalacticans,  an  octopoid  physucturalist  or  two  and  aHooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the  colorblue).  All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been  temporarilyrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through  all  ofthem.  Together  and between them they had gone to and beyond thefurthest limits of physical laws,  restructured  the  fundamentalfabric  of  matter,  strained,  twisted  and  broken  the laws ofpossibility and impossibility, but still the greatest  excitementof  all  seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round hisneck. (An orange sash  was  what  the  President  of  the  Galaxytraditionally  wore.) It might not even have made much differenceto them if theyd known exactly how much power the  President  ofthe  Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in theGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic  President  was  not  towield power but to attract attention away from it.Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.The  crowd  gasped,  dazzled  by  sun  and  seemanship,  as   thePresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. Itflashed and shone as  it  came  skating  over  the  sea  in  wideskidding turns.In fact it didnt need to touch the water at all, because it  wassupported  on  a  hazy  cushion  of  ionized atoms - but just foreffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could  be  loweredinto  the  water.  They  slashed sheets of water hissing into theair, carved deep gashes into the sea  which  swayed  crazily  andsank  back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across thebay.Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed  round  in  a  wildscything  skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightlyon the rocking waves.Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned  atover  three  billion  people.  The  three  billion people werentactually there, but they watched his every  gesture  through  theeyes  of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously inthe air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazinglypopular tri-D; thats what they were for.He grinned again. Three billion and six people  didnt  know  it,but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more  popular  ofhis  two  heads  and  he  waved again. He was roughly humanoid inappearance except for the extra head  and  third  arm.  His  fairtousled  hair  stuck  out  in  random  directions,  his blue eyesglinted with something completely unidentifiable, and  his  chinswere almost always unshaven.A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next  to  his  boat,rolling  and  bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside itfloated a wide semi-circular sofa  upholstered  in  glorious  redleather:  the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofastayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, alldone for effect as much as anything.Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed  on  thesofa.  He  spread his two arms lazily along the back and with thethird brushed some dust off his knee.  His  heads  looked  about,smiling;  he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he mightscream.Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and  spouted.  Thebubble  surged  into  the  air,  bobbing and rolling on the waterspout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the  cliff.Up  it  surged  on  the  jet,  the water falling from beneath it,crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.A thoroughly ridiculous  form  of  transport,  but  a  thoroughlybeautiful one.At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped onto  a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform andriddled to a halt.To tremendous applause  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  stepped  out  of  thebubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.The President of the Galaxy had arrived.He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands  ingreeting."Hi," he said.A government spider sidled up to him and  attempted  to  press  acopy  of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to sevenof the original version were at the moment  floating  soggily  onthe  Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one andtwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle  and  hadalready  become  incorporated  into  an extraordinary new form ofnest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely  ofpapier  m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatchedbaby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond  Crested  Eaglehad  heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted notruck with it.Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing  his  set  speech  and  hegently deflected the one being offered him by the spider."Hi," he said again.Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singledout  Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod hadpicked up recently  whilst  visiting  a  planet,  just  for  fun,incognito.  She  was  slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves ofblack hair, a full mouth,  an  odd  little  nob  of  a  nose  andridiculously  brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in thatparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she  lookedvaguely  Arabic.  Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arabof course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and  evenwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light yearsfrom Damogran. Trillian  wasnt  anybody  in  particular,  or  soZaphod  claimed.  She  just went around with him rather a lot andtold him what she thought of him."Hi honey," he said to her.She flashed him a quick tight smile and  looked  away.  Then  shelooked  back  for  a  moment and smiled more warmly - but by thistime he was looking at something else."Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures  from  the  press  whowere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and geton with the quotes. He grinned at them  particularly  because  heknew  that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of aquote.The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to  them.  Oneof  the  officials  of  the  party had irritably decided that thePresident was clearly not in  a  mood  to  read  the  deliciouslyturned  speech that had been written for him, and had flipped theswitch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in  frontof  them  a  huge  white dome that bulged against the sky crackeddown in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into theground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well itwas going to do that because they had built it that way.Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred  and  fiftymetres  long,  shaped  like a sleek running shoe, perfectly whiteand mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it,  unseen,  lay  asmall  gold  box which carried within it the most brain-wretchingdevice ever conceived, a device which made this  starship  uniquein  the  history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship hadbeen named - The Heart of Gold."Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There  wasntmuch else he could say.He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press."Wow."The crowd turned their faces back  towards  him  expectantly.  Hewinked  at  Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyesat him. She knew what he was about  to  say  and  thought  him  aterrible showoff."That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing.That is so amazingly amazing I think Id like to steal it."A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely  true  to  form.  Thecrowd  laughed  appreciatively,  the  newsmen  gleefully  punchedbuttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned.As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he  fingered  thesmall Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up  to  thesky,  let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to theground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even  for  otherVogons.  His  highly  domed  nose  rose  high above a small piggyforehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him toplay  the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well,and waterproof enough for him  to  survive  indefinitely  at  seadepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule wouldnot allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years agowhen the Vogons had first crawled out of  the  sluggish  primevalseas  of  Vogsphere,  and  had  lain  panting  and heaving on theplanets virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright youngVogsol  sun  had shone across them that morning, it was as if theforces of evolution ad simply given up on them  there  and  then,had  turned  aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly andunfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should  neverhave survived.The fact that they did is some kind  of  tribute  to  the  thick-willed  slug-brained  stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution?they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what  nature  refusedto  do  for  them they simply did without until such time as theywere able to rectify the grosser anatomical  inconveniences  withsurgery.Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet  Vogsphere  had  beenworking  overtime  to  make  up  for  their earlier blunder. Theybrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs,  which  theVogons  ate,  smashing  their  shells  with  iron  mallets;  tallaspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which theVogons  cut  down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which  the  Vogonswould  catch  and  sit  on. They were no use as transport becausetheir backs would snap instantly, but  the  Vogons  sat  on  themanyway.Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia untilthe  Vogons  suddenly  discovered  the principles of interstellartravel. Within a  few  short  Vog  years  every  last  Vogon  hadmigrated  to  the  Megabrantis  cluster, the political hub of theGalaxy and now formed the  immensely  powerful  backbone  of  theGalactic  Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning,they have attempted to acquire style and  social  grace,  but  inmost  respects  the  modern  Vogon  is  little different from hisprimitive forebears. Every year they import twenty-seven thousandscintillating  jewelled  scuttling crabs from their native planetand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to  bits  withiron mallets.Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he  wasthoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitch hikers.Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines  ofProstetnic   Vogon   Jeltzs   flagship,  a  small  match  flarednervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon,  but  he  knewall  about  them  and  was right to be nervous. His name was FordPrefect*.He looked about the cabin but  could  see  very  little;  strangemonstrous  shadows  loomed  and  leaped  with the tiny flickeringflame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you  to  theDentrassis.  The  Dentrassis  are an unruly tribe of gourmands, awild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons  had  recently  taken  toemploying  as  catering  staff  on their long haul fleets, on thestrict understanding that  they  keep  themselves  very  much  tothemselves.This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon  money,which  is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed theVogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a  Dentrassi  liked  tosee was an annoyed Vogon.It was because of  this  tiny  piece  of  information  that  FordPrefect  was  not  now  a  whiff  of  hydrogen,  ozone and carbonmonoxide.He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavyshape  moving  slightly  on the floor. Quickly he shook the matchout, reached in his pocket, found what he  was  looking  for  andtook it out. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again.Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts."Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently."Here, have some," urged Ford,  shaking  the  packet  again,  "ifyouve  never  been  through  a  matter  transference beam beforeyouve probably lost some salt and  protein.  The  beer  you  hadshould have cushioned your system a bit.""Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes."Its dark," he said."Yes," said Ford Prefect, "its dark.""No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light."One of the things  Ford  Prefect  had  always  found  hardest  tounderstand  about  human  beings  was  their habit of continuallystating and repeating the obvious, as in  Its  a  nice  day,  orYoure  very  tall,  or  Oh  dear  you seem to have fallen down athirty-foot well, are you alright? At first  Ford  had  formed  atheory  to  account  for  this strange behaviour. If human beingsdont keep  exercising  their  lips,  he  thought,  their  mouthsprobably   seize  up.  After  a  few  months  consideration  andobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new  one.  Ifthey  dont  keep  on  exercising  their  lips, he thought, theirbrains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as wellas  being  obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked humanbeings after all, but  he  always  remained  desperately  worriedabout the terrible number of things they didnt know about."Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light."  He  helped  Arthur  tosome peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked."Like a military academy," said  Arthur,  "bits  of  me  keep  onpassing out."Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness."If I asked you where the hell  we  were,"  said  Arthur  weakly,"would I regret it?"Ford stood up. "Were safe," he said."Oh good," said Arthur."Were in a small galley  cabin,"  said  Ford,  "in  one  of  thespaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.""Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage  of  theword safe that I wasnt previously aware of."Ford struck another match to help him search for a light  switch.Monstrous  shadows  leaped  and loomed again. Arthur struggled tohis feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien  shapesseemed  to  throng about him, the air was thick with musty smellswhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and alow irritating hum kept his brain from focusing."How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly."We hitched a lift," said Ford."Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we juststuck  out  our  thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck hishead out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as faras the Basingstoke roundabout?""Well," said Ford, "the Thumbs an electronic sub-etha signallingdevice,  the roundabouts at Barnards Star six light years away,but otherwise, thats more or less right.""And the bug-eyed monster?""Is green, yes.""Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?""You cant," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch."Shade your eyes ..." he said, and turned it on.Even Ford was surprised."Good grief," said Arthur, "is this  really  the  interior  of  aflying saucer?"Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round thecontrol   bridge.   He   always   felt  vaguely  irritable  afterdemolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would  comeand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at themand feel better. He flopped as heavily as  he  could  on  to  hiscontrol  seat  in  the  hope  that  it  would  break and give himsomething to be  genuinely  angry  about,  but  it  only  gave  acomplaining sort of creak."Go away!" he shouted at a young  Vogon  guard  who  entered  thebridge  at  that  moment. The guard vanished immediately, feelingrather relieved. He was glad it wouldnt now be him who deliveredthe  report  theyd  just  received.  The  report was an officialrelease which said that a wonderful new form of  spaceship  drivewas  at  this moment being unveiled at a government research baseon Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial  expressroutes unnecessary.Another door slid open, but this time the  Vogon  captain  didntshout  because it was the door from the galley quarters where theDentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome.A huge furry creature bounded through the  door  with  his  lunchtray. It was grinning like a maniac.Prostetnic Vogon  Jeltz  was  delighted.  He  knew  that  when  aDentrassi  looked  that  pleased  with itself there was somethinggoing on somewhere on the ship  that  he  could  get  very  angryindeed about.Ford and Arthur stared about them."Well, what do you think?" said Ford."Its a bit squalid, isnt it?"Ford  frowned  at  the  grubby  mattress,   unwashed   cups   andunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around thecramped cabin."Well, this is a working ship, you see," said  Ford.  "These  arethe Dentrassi sleeping quarters.""I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.""Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship,  the  Dentrassis  arethe cooks, they let us on board.""Im confused," said Arthur."Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of themattresses  and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded themattress nervously and then sat on it himself:  in  fact  he  hadvery  little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown inthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed  anddried  before  being  put  to service. Very few have ever come tolife again.Ford handed the book to Arthur."What is it?" asked Arthur."The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Its a sort of  electronicbook.  It  tells  you everything you need to know about anything.Thats its job."Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands."I like the cover," he said. "Dont Panic. Its the first helpfulor intelligible thing anybodys said to me all day.""Ill show you how it works," said  Ford.  He  snatched  it  fromArthur who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead larkand pulled it out of its cover."You press this button here you see  and  the  screen  lights  upgiving you the index."A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters beganto flicker across the surface."You want to know about Vogons, so I enter  that  name  so."  Hisfingers tapped some more keys. "And there we are."The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared  in  green  across  thescreen.Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the  screen  andwords  began  to  undulate  across it. At the same time, the bookbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice.This is what the book said."Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to  geta  lift  from  a  Vogon:  forget  it.  They  are  one of the mostunpleasant races in the Galaxy --  not  actually  evil,  but  badtempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldnt evenlift a finger to save their own grandmothers  from  the  RavenousBugblatter  Beast  of  Traal without orders signed in triplicate,sent in, sent back, queried, lost,  found,  subjected  to  publicinquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycledas firelighters."The best way to get a drink out of a  Vogon  is  to  stick  yourfinger  down  his  throat, and the best way to irritate him is tofeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal."On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you."Arthur blinked at it."What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?""Thats the point, its out of date now," said Ford, sliding  thebook  back  into its cover. "Im doing the field research for theNew Revised Edition, and one of the things Ill have  to  includeis  a  bit  about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks whichgives us a rather useful little loophole."A pained expression crossed  Arthurs  face.  "But  who  are  theDentrassi?" he said."Great guys," said Ford. "Theyre the best  cooks  and  the  bestdrink  mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything else.And theyll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because  theylike  the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Whichis exactly the sort of thing  you  need  to  know  if  youre  animpoverished  hitch  hiker  trying  to  see  the  marvels  of theUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And  thatsmy job. Fun, isnt it?"Arthur looked lost."Its  amazing,"  he  said  and  frowned  at  one  of  the  othermattresses."Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than  Iintended,"  said  Ford.  "I  came  for  a  week and got stuck forfifteen years.""But how did you get there in the first place then?""Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.""A teaser?""Yeah.""Er, what is ...""A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. Theycruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellarcontact yet and buzz them.""Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was  enjoying  makinglife difficult for him."Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated  spotwith  very  few  people around, then land right by some poor soulwhom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down infront  of  him  wearing  silly antennae on their heads and makingbeep beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back on themattress  with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatinglypleased with himself."Ford," insisted Arthur, "I dont know  if  this  sounds  like  asilly question, but what am I doing here?""Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth.""And whats happened to the Earth?""Ah. Its been demolished.""Has it," said Arthur levelly."Yes. It just boiled away into space.""Look," said Arthur, "Im a bit upset about that."Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around hismind."Yes, I can understand that," he said at last."Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!"Ford sprang up."Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently."What?""Dont Panic.""Im not panicking!""Yes you are.""Alright so Im panicking, what else is there to do?""You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxys afun place. Youll need to have this fish in your ear.""I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly  had  asmall  yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him.He wished there was something simple and  recognizable  he  couldgrasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassiunderwear, the piles of Squornshellous  mattresses  and  the  manfrom  Betelgeuse  holding  up a small yellow fish and offering toput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet  ofcorn flakes. He couldnt, and he didnt feel safe.Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from  no  source  that  hecould  identify.  He  gasped in terror at what sounded like a mantrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves."Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important.""Im ... important?""Its the Vogon captain making an announcement on the Tannoy.""You mean thats how the Vogons talk?""Listen!""But I cant speak Vogon!""You dont need to. Just put that fish in your ear."Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped  his  hand  to  Arthursear,  and  he  had  the  sudden  sickening  sensation of the fishslithering deep into his aural  tract.  Gasping  with  horror  hescrabbled  at  his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turnedgoggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalentof  looking  at  a  picture  of  two  black silhouetted faces andsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a  white  candlestick.  Or  oflooking  at  a  lot  of  coloured  dots on a piece of paper whichsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure  six  and  mean  thatyour  optician  is  going  to charge you a lot of money for a newpair of glasses.He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, onlynow  it  had  taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforwardEnglish.This is what he heard ..."Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle  howl  garglehowl  howl  gargle  gargle  howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrpuuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats.  This  is  yourcaptain   speaking,   so  stop  whatever  youre  doing  and  payattention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have acouple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just wantto make it totally clear that you  are  not  at  all  welcome.  Iworked  hard to get where I am today, and I didnt become captainof a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxiservice  for  a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out asearch party, and as soon that they find you I will put  you  offthe ship. If youre very lucky I might read you some of my poetryfirst."Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for  the  journeyto  Barnards  Star.  On  arrival  we  will  stay  in  dock for aseventy-two hour refit, and no ones to  leave  the  ship  duringthat time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. Ive just hadan unhappy love affair, so I dont see why  anybody  else  shouldhave a good time. Message ends."The noise stopped.Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was  lying  curledup  in  a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round hishead. He smiled weakly."Charming man," he said. "I wish I had  a  daughter  so  I  couldforbid her to marry one ...""You wouldnt need to," said  Ford.  "Theyve  got  as  much  sexappeal  as  a  road accident. No, dont move," he added as Arthurbegan to uncurl himself, "youd better be prepared for  the  jumpinto hyperspace. Its unpleasantly like being drunk.""Whats so unpleasant about being drunk?""You ask a glass of water."Arthur thought about this."Ford," he said."Yeah?""Whats this fish doing in my ear?""Its translating for you. Its a Babel fish. Look it up  in  thebook if you like."He tossed over The Hitch Hikers Guide to  the  Galaxy  and  thencurled  himself  up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for thejump.At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthurs mind.His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the topof his head.The room folded flat about  him,  spun  around,  shifted  out  ofexistence and left him sliding into his own navel.They were passing through hyperspace."The Babel fish," said The Hitch  Hikers  Guide  to  the  Galaxyquietly,  "is  small,  yellow  and  leech-like,  and probably theoddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on  brainwave  energy  notfrom  its  carrier  but  from  those  around  it.  It absorbs allunconscious mental frequencies  from  this  brainwave  energy  tonourish  itself  with.  It  then  excretes  into  the mind of itscarrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining  the  consciousthought  frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speechcentres of the brain  which  has  supplied  them.  The  practicalupshot  of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your earyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form  oflanguage.  The  speech  patterns  you  actually  hear  decode thebrainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your  Babelfish."Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that  anythingso  mind-bog-gin-gly useful could have evolved purely by chance thatsome thin-kers have chosen to see it as the  final  and  clinchingproof of the non-existence of God."The argument goes something like this: I refuse to prove that Iexist, says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I amnothing."But, says Man, The Babel fish is a dead giveaway,  isnt  it?It  could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and sotherefore, by your own arguments, you dont. QED."Oh dear, says God, I hadnt thought of  that,  and  promptlyvanished in a puff of logic."Oh, that was easy, says Man, and for  an  encore  goes  on  toprove  that  black  is  white and gets himself killed on the nextzebra crossing."Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a  load  ofdingos  kidneys,  but  that didnt stop Oolon Colluphid making asmall fortune when he used it as the central theme of  his  best-selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God."Meanwhile, the poor Babel  fish,  by  effectively  removing  allbarriers  to  communication between different races and cultures,has caused more and bloddier  wars  than  anything  else  in  thehistory of creation."Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that thekick  through  hyperspace hadnt killed him. He was now six lightyears from the place that the Earth would have been if  it  stillexisted.The Earth.Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind.  Therewas  no  way  his  imagination could feel the impact of the wholeEarth having gone, it was too big. He  prodded  his  feelings  bythinking  that  his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction.He thought of all the people he had been close to.  No  reaction.Then  he  thought  of  a  complete  stranger he had been standingbehind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt  a  suddenstab  -  the  supermarket  was  gone,  everything in it was gone.Nelsons Column had gone! Nelsons  Column  had  gone  and  therewould  be  no  outcry,  because  there was no one left to make anoutcry. From now on Nelsons Column only  existed  in  his  mind.England  only  existed in his mind - his mind, stuck here in thisdank smelly  steel-lined  spaceship.  A  wave  of  claustrophobiaclosed in on him.England no longer existed. Hed got that - somehow hed  got  it.He  tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldnt graspit. He decided to start smaller again.  New  York  has  gone.  Noreaction.  Hed  never  seriously believed it existed anyway. Thedollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. EveryBogart  movie  has  been wiped, he said to himself, and that gavehim a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer  anysuch thing as a McDonalds hamburger.He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he  wassobbing for his mother.He jerked himself violently to his feet."Ford!"Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner  humming  tohimself. He always found the actual travelling-through-space partof space travel rather trying."Yeah?" he said."If youre a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth,you must have been gathering material on it.""Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes.""Let me see what it says in this edition then, Ive  got  to  seeit.""Yeah OK." He passed it over again.Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. Hepressed  the  entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed andswirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it."It doesnt have an entry!" he burst out.Ford looked over his shoulder."Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at  the  bottom  of  thescreen,  just  under  Eccentrica  Gallumbits, the triple-breastedwhore of Eroticon ."Arthur followed Fords finger, and saw where it was pointing. Fora moment it still didnt register, then his mind nearly blew up."What? Harmless? Is that all  its  got  to  say?  Harmless!  Oneword!"Ford shrugged."Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and  onlya  limited  amount  of  space  in the books microprocessors," hesaid, "and no one knew much about the Earth of course.""Well for Gods sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit.""Oh yes, well I managed to  transmit  a  new  entry  off  to  theeditor. He had to trim it a bit, but its still an improvement.""And what does it say now?" asked Arthur."Mostly harmless," admitted  Ford  with  a  slightly  embarrassedcough."Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur."What was that noise?" hissed Ford."It was me shouting," shouted Arthur."No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think were in trouble.""You think were in trouble!"Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet."The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur."No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford.There was a sharp ringing rap on the door."Then who is it?" said Arthur."Well," said Ford, "if were lucky its just the Vogons  come  tothrow us in to space.""And if were unlucky?""If were unlucky," said  Ford  grimly,  "the  captain  might  beserious  in  his  threat  that  hes going to read us some of hispoetry first ..."Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.The second worst is that  of  the  Azagoths  of  Kria.  During  arecitation  by  their  Poet  Master Grunthos the Flatulent of hispoem "Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit OneMidsummer   Morning"  four  of  his  audience  died  of  internalhaemorrhaging,  and  the  President  of  the  Mid-Galactic   ArtsNobbling  Council  survived  by  gnawing one of his own legs off.Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed"  by  the  poemsreception,  and  was  about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime  Gurgles  when  his  ownmajor  intestine,  in  a  desperate  attempt  to  save  life  andcivilization, leapt straight up through his  neck  and  throttledhis brain.The very worst poetry of all  perished  along  with  its  creatorPaula  Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England inthe destruction of the planet Earth.Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done  not  somuch for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequenceof muscle movements. He had had a terribly  therapeutic  yell  athis  prisoners  and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for alittle callousness.The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation  Chairs  --strapped  in.Vogons  suffered  no  illusions as to the regard their works weregenerally held in. Their early attempts at composition  had  beenpart  of  bludgeoning  insistence  that  they  be  accepted  as aproperly evolved and cultured race, but now the only  thing  thatkept them going was sheer bloodymindedness.The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefects brow, and  slid  roundthe  electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to abattery of electronic equipment - imagery intensifiers,  rhythmicmodulators,  alliterative  residulators  and simile dumpers - alldesigned to heighten the experience of the  poem  and  make  surethat not a single nuance of the poets thought was lost.Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in  for,but  he  knew  that he hadnt liked anything that had happened sofar and didnt think things were likely to change.The Vogon began to read - a  fetid  little  passage  of  his  owndevising."Oh frettled gruntbuggly ..." he  began.  Spasms  wracked  Fordsbody - this was worse than ever hed been prepared for."... thy micturations are to me  As plurdled gabbleblotchits  ona lurgid bee.""Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head backas  lumps  of  pain thumped through it. He could dimly see besidehim Arthur lolling and rolling  in  his  seat.  He  clenched  histeeth."Groop I  implore  thee,"  continued  the  merciless  Vogon,  "myfoonting turlingdromes."His  voice  was  rising  to  a  horrible  pitch  of   impassionedstridency.    "And    hooptiously   drangle   me   with   crinklybindlewurdles, Or I will rend thee in the  gobberwarts  with  myblurglecruncheon, see if I dont!""Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefectand  threw  one  final spasm as the electronic enhancement of thelast line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp.Arthur lolled."Now Earthlings ..." whirred the Vogon (he didnt know that  FordPrefect  was  in  fact  from  a  small  planet in the vicinity ofBetelgeuse, and wouldnt have cared if he  had)  "I  present  youwith  a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or ..."he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you  thoughtmy poem was!"He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery  bat-shaped  seatand watched them. He did the smile again.Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round hisparched mouth and moaned.Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it."Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simplynot occurred to him.The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow  that  effectively  obscuredhis nose and was therefore no bad thing."Oh good ..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment."Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of  the  metaphysicalimagery was really particularly effective."Ford continued to stare at him, slowly  organizing  his  thoughtsaround  this  totally  new  concept. Were they really going to beable to bareface their way out of this?"Yes, do continue ..." invited the Vogon."Oh ... and er ... interesting rhythmic devices  too,"  continuedArthur,  "which  seemed to counterpoint the ... er ... er ..." Hefloundered.Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealismof  the underlying metaphor of the ... er ..." He floundered too,but Arthur was ready again."... humanity of the ...""Vogonity," Ford hissed at him."Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry)  of  the  poets  compassionate  soul,"Arthur  felt  he  was  on  a  home  stretch now, "which contrivesthrough the medium of the  verse  structure  to  sublimate  this,transcend   that,   and   come  to  terms  with  the  fundamentaldichotomies  of  the  other,"  (he  was  reaching  a   triumphantcrescendo ...) "and one is left with a profound and vivid insightinto ... into ... er ..." (... which suddenly gave out  on  him.)Ford leaped in with the coup de gr@ce:"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of  thecorner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good."The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered  racial  soulhad  been  touched,  but he thought no - too little too late. Hisvoice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon."So what youre saying is that I write poetry because  underneathmy  mean  callous  heartless  exterior  I  really just want to beloved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?"Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said,  "dontwe all, deep down, you know ... er ..."The Vogon stood up."No, well youre completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetryto  throw  my  mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief.Im going to throw you off  the  ship  anyway.  Guard!  Take  theprisoners to number three airlock and throw them out!""What?" shouted Ford.A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them  out  oftheir straps with his huge blubbery arms."You cant throw us into space," yelled Ford,  "were  trying  towrite a book.""Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him.  Itwas  the  first phrase hed learnt when he joined the Vogon GuardCorps.The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.Arthur stared round him wildly."I dont want to die now!" he yelled. "Ive still got a headache!I  dont  want  to go to heaven with a headache, Id be all crossand wouldnt enjoy it!"The guard grasped them both firmly round  the  neck,  and  bowingdeferentially  towards  his  captains  back,  hoiked  them  bothprotesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captainwas  on  his  own  again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself,lightly fingering his notebook of verses."Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the  underlyingmetaphor  ..."  He  considered this for a moment, and then closedthe book with a grim smile."Deaths too good for them," he said.The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble  struggles  ofthe two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits."This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Letgo of me you brute!"The Vogon guard dragged them on."Dont you worry," said  Ford,  "Ill  think  of  something."  Hedidnt sound hopeful."Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard."Just dont say things  like  that,"  stammered  Ford.  "How  cananyone  maintain  a  positive  mental  attitude  if youre sayingthings like that?""My God," complained Arthur, "youre  talking  about  a  positivemental  attitude  and you havent even had your planet demolishedtoday. I woke up this morning and thought Id have a nice relaxedday,  do  a bit of reading, brush the dog ... Its now just afterfour in the afternoon and Im already  thrown  out  of  an  alienspaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!"He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip."Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking.""Who said anything about panicking?"  snapped  Arthur.  "This  isstill  just  the  culture  shock. You wait till Ive settled downinto the  situation  and  found  my  bearings.  Then  Ill  startpanicking.""Arthur  youre  getting  hysterical.  Shut   up!"   Ford   trieddesperately  to  think, but was interrupted by the guard shoutingagain."Resistance is useless!""And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford."Resistance is useless!""Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till  he  waslooking straight up into his captors face. A thought struck him."Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly.The Vogon stopped dead and a look  of  immense  stupidity  seepedslowly over his face."Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?""What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full  satisfyinglife?

Желтый халат его, враспояску, слегка вздымался за ним на мягком утреннем ветерке.Он поднял чашку перед собою и возгласил[]:    [].Остановясь, он вгляделся вниз, в сумрак винтовой лестницы, и грубо крикнул: Выходи, Клинк! Выходи, иезуит несчастный!Торжественно он проследовал вперед и взошел на круглую орудийную площадку[]. Обернувшись по сторонам, он с важностью троекратно благословил башню, окрестный берег и пробуждающиеся горы. Потом, увидев Стивена Дедала, наклонился к нему и начал быстро крестить воздух, булькая горлом и подергивая головой. Стивен Дедал, недовольный и заспанный, облокотясь на последнюю ступеньку, холодно смотрел на дергающееся булькающее лицо, что благословляло его, длинное как у лошади, и на бестонзурную шевелюру, белесую, словно окрашенную под светлый дуб.Бык Маллиган заглянул под зеркальце и тут же опять прикрыл чашку. По казармам!  скомандовал он сурово.И пастырским голосом продолжал: Ибо сие, о возлюбленные мои, есть истинная Христина, тело и кровь, печенки и селезенки. Музыку медленней, пожалуйста. Господа, закройте глаза. Минуту. Маленькая заминка, знаете, с белыми шариками. Всем помолчать.Он устремил взгляд искоса вверх, издал долгий, протяжный призывный свист и замер, напряженно прислушиваясь. Белые ровные зубы кой-где поблескивали золотыми крупинками. Златоуст. Резкий ответный свист дважды прозвучал в тишине. Спасибо, старина,  живо откликнулся он.  Так будет чудненько. Можешь выключать ток!Он соскочил с площадки и с важностью поглядел на своего зрителя, собирая у ног складки просторного халата. Жирное затененное лицо и тяжелый овальный подбородок напоминали средневекового прелата[], покровителя искусств. Довольная улыбка показалась у него на губах. Смех да и только,  сказал он весело.  Это нелепое твое имя, как у древнего грека.Ткнув пальцем с дружелюбной насмешкой, он отошел к парапету, посмеиваясь. Стивен Дедал, поднявшись до конца лестницы, устало побрел за ним, но, не дойдя, уселся на край площадки и принялся наблюдать, как тот, пристроив на парапете зеркальце и обмакнув в пену помазок, намыливает шею и щеки.Веселый голос Быка Маллигана не умолкал: У меня тоже нелепое  Мэйлахи Маллиган, два дактиля. Но тут звучит что-то эллинское, правда ведь? Что-то солнечное и резвое, как сам бычок. Мы непременно должны поехать в Афины. Поедешь, если я раздобуду у тетушки двадцать фунтов?Он положил помазок и в полном восторге воскликнул: Это он-то поедет? Изнуренный иезуит.Оборвал себя и начал тщательно бриться. Послушай, Маллиган,  промолвил Стивен негромко. Да, моя радость? Долго еще Хейнс будет жить в башне?Бык Маллиган явил над правым плечом свежевыбритую щеку. Кошмарная личность, а?  сказал он от души.  Этакий толстокожий сакс. Он считает, что ты не джентльмен. Эти мне гнусные англичане! Их так и пучит от денег и от запоров. Он, видите ли, из Оксфорда. А знаешь, Дедал, вот у тебя-то настоящий оксфордский стиль. Он все никак тебя не раскусит. Нет, лучшее тебе имя придумал я: Клинк, острый клинок.Он выбривал с усердием подбородок. Всю ночь бредил про какую-то черную пантеру,  проговорил Стивен.  Где у него ружье? Совсем малый спятил,  сказал Маллиган.  А ты перетрусил не на шутку? Еще бы,  произнес Стивен с энергией и нарастающим страхом.  В кромешном мраке, с каким-то незнакомцем, который стонет и бредит, что надо застрелить пантеру. Ты спасал тонущих[]. Но я, знаешь ли, не герой. Если он тут останется, я ухожу.Бык Маллиган глядел, насупясь, на бритву, покрытую мыльной пеной. Соскочив со своего возвышения, он торопливо стал рыться в карманах брюк. Драла!  пробормотал он сквозь зубы.Вернувшись к площадке, он запустил руку в верхний карман Стивена и сказал: Позвольте одолжиться вашим сморкальником, вытереть нашу бритву.Стивен покорно дал ему вытащить и развернуть напоказ, держа за угол, измятый и нечистый платок. Бык Маллиган заботливо вытер лезвие. Вслед за этим, разглядывая платок, он объявил: Сморкальник барда. Новый оттенок в палитру ирландского стихотворца: сопливо-зеленый. Почти ощущаешь вкус, правда?Он снова поднялся к парапету и бросил долгий взгляд на залив. Ветерок шевелил белокурую, под светлый дуб, шевелюру. Господи!  сказал он негромко.  Как верно названо море у Элджи: седая нежная мать! Сопливо-зеленое море. Яйцещемящее море. Эпи ойнопа понтон.[]Ах, эти греки, Дедал. Надо мне тебя обучить. Ты должен прочесть их в подлиннике. Талатта! Талатта ![] Наша великая и нежная мать[]. Иди сюда и взгляни.Стивен встал и подошел к парапету. Перегнувшись, он посмотрел вниз на воду и на почтовый пароход, выходящий из гавани Кингстауна. Наша могущественная мать,  произнес Бык Маллиган.Внезапно он отвел взгляд от моря и большими пытливыми глазами посмотрел Стивену в лицо. Моя тетка считает, ты убил свою мать[],  сказал он.  Поэтому она бы мне вообще запретила с тобой встречаться. Кто-то ее убил,  сумрачно бросил Стивен. Черт побери, Клинк, уж на колени ты бы мог стать, если умирающая мать просит,  сказал Бык Маллиган.  Я сам гипербореец[] не хуже тебя. Но это ж подумать только, мать с последним вздохом умоляет стать на колени[], помолиться за нее  и ты отказываешься. Нет, что-то в тебе зловещее[]Оборвал себя и начал намыливать другую щеку. Всепрощающая улыбка тронула его губы. Но бесподобный комедиант!  шепнул он тихонько.  Клинк, бесподобнейший из комедиантов.Он брился плавно и осмотрительно, в истовом молчании.Стивен, поставив локоть на шершавый гранит, подперев лоб ладонью, неподвижно смотрел на обтерханные края своего черного лоснистого рукава. Боль, что не была еще болью любви, саднила сердце его. Во сне, безмолвно, она явилась ему после смерти, ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева, а дыхание, когда она с немым укором склонилась над ним, веяло сыростью могильного тлена. Поверх ветхой манжеты он видел море, которое сытый голос превозносил как великую и нежную мать. Кольцо залива и горизонта заполняла тускло-зеленая влага.Белый фарфоровый сосуд у ее смертного одра заполняла тягучая зеленая желчь, которую она с громкими стонами извергала из своей гниющей печени в приступах мучительной рвоты.Бык Маллиган заново обтер бритву. Эх, пес-бедолага!  с участием вздохнул он.  Надо бы выдать тебе рубашку да хоть пару сморкальников. А как те штаны, что купили с рук? Как будто впору,  отвечал Стивен.Бык Маллиган атаковал ложбинку под нижней губой. Смех да и только,  произнес он довольно.  Верней будет, с ног. Дознайся, какая там пьянь заразная таскала их. У меня есть отличная пара, серые, в узкую полоску. Ты бы в них выглядел потрясающе. Нет, кроме шуток, Клинк. Ты очень недурно смотришься, когда прилично одет. Спасибо,  ответил Стивен.  Если они серые, я их не могу носить[]. Он их не может носить,  сказал Бык Маллиган своему отражению в зеркале.  Этикет значит этикет. Он мать родную убил, но серые брюки ни за что не оденет.Он сложил аккуратно бритву и легкими касаньями пальцев ощупал гладкую кожу.Стивен перевел взгляд с залива на жирное лицо с мутно-голубыми бегающими глазами[]. Этот малый, с кем я сидел в Корабле прошлый вечер,  сказал Бык Маллиган,  уверяет, у тебя п.п.с. Он в желтом доме работает у Конопли Нормана. Прогрессивный паралич со слабоумием.Он описал зеркальцем полукруг, повсюду просверкав эту весть солнечными лучами, уже сияющими над морем. Изогнутые бритые губы, кончики блестящих белых зубов смеялись. Смех овладел всем его сильным и ладным телом. На, полюбуйся-ка на себя, горе-бард!  сказал он.Стивен наклонился и глянул в подставленное зеркало, расколотое кривой трещиной. Волосы дыбом. Так взор его и прочих видит меня[]. Кто мне выбрал это лицо? Эту паршивую шкуру пса-бедолаги? Оно тоже спрашивает меня. Я его стянул у служанки из комнаты,  поведал Бык Маллиган.  Ей в самый раз такое. Тетушка ради Мэйлахи всегда нанимает неказистых. Не введи его во искушение. И зовут-то Урсулой[].Снова залившись смехом, он убрал зеркальце из-под упорного взгляда Стивена. Ярость Калибана[], не видящего в зеркале своего отражения,  изрек он. Как жалко, Уайльд не дожил на тебя поглядеть!Отступив и показывая на зеркало, Стивен с горечью произнес: Вот символ ирландского искусства. Треснувшее зеркало служанки[].Неожиданно и порывисто Бык Маллиган подхватил Стивена под руку и зашагал с ним вокруг башни, позвякивая бритвой и зеркальцем, засунутыми в карман. Грех тебя так дразнить, правда, Клинк?  сказал он дружески.  Видит бог, в голове у тебя побольше, чем у них всех.Еще выпад отбит. Скальпель художника страшит его, как меня  докторский. Хладная сталь пера. Треснувшее зеркало служанки! Ты это скажи тому олуху из Оксфорда да вытяни из него гинею. Он весь провонял деньгами и считает, что ты не джентльмен. А у самого папаша набил мошну, сбывая негритосам слабительное, а может, еще на каких делишках. Эх, Клинк, если бы мы с тобой действовали сообща, уж мы бы кое-что сделали для нашего острова. Эллинизировали бы его.Рука Крэнли. Его рука[]. И подумать только, ты вынужден побираться у этих свиней. Я один-единственный понимаю, что ты за человек. Почему ж ты так мало мне доверяешь? Из-за чего все воротишь нос? Из-за Хейнса? Да пусть только пикнет, я притащу Сеймура, и мы ему закатим трепку еще похлеще, чем досталась Клайву Кемпторпу.Крики юных богатеньких голосов в квартире Клайва Кемпторпа. Бледнолицые: держатся за бока от хохота, хватаются друг за друга, ох, умора! Обри, бережно весть эту ей передай! Сейчас помру! В изрезанной рубашке, вьющейся лентами по воздуху, в съехавших до полу штанах, он, спотыкаясь, скачет вокруг стола, а за ним Эйдс из Магдалины с портновскими ножницами. Мордочка ошалелого теленка, позолоченная вареньем. Не надо, не сдирайте штаны! Не набрасывайтесь на меня, как бешеные[]!Крики из распахнутого окна вспугивают вечер во дворе колледжа. Глухой садовник в фартуке, замаскированный лицом Мэтью Арнольда, продвигается по темному газону с косилкой, вглядываясь в танцующий рой травинок.Нам самим новое язычество омфал.[] Ладно, пусть остается,  сказал Стивен.  Так-то он ничего, только по ночам. Тогда в чем же дело?  наседал Бык Маллиган.  Давай рожай. Я-то ведь напрямик с тобой. Что у тебя такое против меня?Они остановились, глядя туда, где тупая оконечность мыса Брэй-Хед покоилась на воде, словно голова спящего кита. Стивен осторожно высвободил руку. Ты хочешь, чтобы я сказал тебе?  спросил он. Да, в чем там дело?  повторил Бык Маллиган.  Я ничего не припоминаю.Говоря это, он в упор посмотрел на Стивена. Легкий ветерок пробежал по его лицу, вороша светлую спутанную шевелюру и зажигая в глазах серебряные искорки беспокойства.Стивен, удручаясь собственным голосом, сказал: Ты помнишь, как я пришел к тебе домой в первый раз после смерти матери?Бык Маллиган, мгновенно нахмурившись, отвечал: Как? Где? Убей, не могу припомнить. Я запоминаю только идеи и ощущения[]. Ну и что? Чего там стряслось, бога ради? Ты готовил чай,  продолжал Стивен,  а я пошел на кухню за кипятком. Из комнат вышла твоя мать и с ней кто-то из гостей. Она спросила, кто у тебя. Ну?  не отступал Бык Маллиган.  А я что сказал? Я уже все забыл. А ты сказал,  ответил Стивен ему,  Да так, просто Дедал, у которого мамаша подохла[].Бык Маллиган покраснел и стал казаться от этого моложе и привлекательней. Я так сказал?  переспросил он.  И что же? Что тут такого?Нервным движением он стряхнул свое замешательство. А что, по-твоему, смерть,  спросил он,  твоей матери, или твоя, или, положим, моя? Ты видел только, как умирает твоя мать. А я каждый день вижу, как они отдают концы и в Ричмонде, и в Скорбящей, да после их крошат на потроха в анатомичке. Это и называется подох, ничего больше. И не о чем говорить. Ты вот не соизволил стать на колени и помолиться за свою мать, когда она просила тебя на смертном одре. А почему? Да потому, что в тебе эта проклятая иезуитская закваска[], только она проявляется наоборот. По мне, тут одна падаль и пустая комедия. Ее лобные доли уже не действуют. Она называет доктора сэр Питер Тизл[] и хочет нарвать лютиков с одеяла. Уж не перечь ей, вот-вот все кончится. Ты сам не исполнил ее предсмертную просьбу, а теперь дуешься на меня, что я не скулил, как наемный плакальщик от Лалуэтта. Абсурд! Допустим, я и сказал так. Но я вовсе не хотел оскорбить память твоей матери.Его речь вернула ему самоуверенность. Стивен, скрывая зияющие раны, оставленные словами в его сердце, как можно суше сказал: Я и не говорю, что это оскорбляет мою мать. Так что же тогда?  спросил Бык Маллиган. Это оскорбляет меня,  был ответ.Бык Маллиган круто повернулся на каблуках. Нет, невозможный субъект!  воскликнул он.И пошел прочь быстрым шагом вдоль парапета. Стивен остался на месте, недвижно глядя на мыс и на спокойную гладь залива. Море и мыс сейчас подернулись дымкой. В висках стучала кровь, застилая взор, и он чувствовал, как лихорадочно горят его щеки.Громкий голос позвал снизу, из башни: Маллиган, вы где, наверху? Сейчас иду,  откликнулся Бык Маллиган.Он обернулся к Стивену и сказал: Взгляни на море. Что ему до всех оскорблений? Бросай-ка лучше Лойолу, Клинк, и двигаем вниз. Наш сакс поджидает уже свой бекон.Голова его задержалась на миг над лестницей, вровень с крышей. И не хандри из-за этого целый день. У меня же семь пятниц на неделе.Оставь скорбные думы.Голова скрылась, но мерный голос продолжал, опускаясь, доноситься из лестничного проема:Не прячь глаза и не скорбиНад горькой тайною любви,Там Фергус правит в полный рост,Владыка медных колесниц.[]В мирном спокойствии утра тени лесов неслышно проплывали от лестничного проема к морю, туда, куда он глядел. У берега и мористей водная гладь белела следами стремительных легких стоп. Морской волны белеет грудь.Попарные сплетения ударений. Рука, перебирающая струны арфы, рождает сплетения аккордов. Слитносплетенных словес словно волн белогрудых мерцанье.Облако медленно наползает на солнце, и гуще делается в тени зелень залива. Он был за спиной у него, сосуд горьких вод[]. Песня Фергуса. Я пел ее, оставшись дома один, приглушая долгие сумрачные аккорды. Дверь к ней была открыта: она хотела слышать меня. Безмолвно, с жалостью и благоговением, я приблизился к ее ложу. Она плакала на своем убогом одре. Над этими словами, Стивен: над горькой тайною любви.Где же теперь? Ее секреты в запертом ящичке: старые веера из перьев, бальные книжечки с бахромой, пропитанные мускусом, убор из янтарных бус. Когда она была девочкой, у ее окошка висела на солнце клетка с птицей. Она видела старика Ройса в представлении Свирепый турка и вместе со всеми смеялась, когда он распевал:Открою вам,Что рад бы самЯ невидимкой стать.Мимолетные радости, заботливо сложенные, надушенные мускусом.Не прячь глаза и не скорби.Сложены в памяти природы[], вместе с ее детскими игрушками. Скорбные воспоминания осаждают его разум. Стакан воды из крана на кухне, когда она собиралась к причастию. Яблоко с сахаром внутри, испеченное для нее на плите в темный осенний вечер. Ее изящные ногти, окрашенные кровью вшей с детских рубашонок.Во сне, безмолвно, она явилась ему, ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева, ее дыхание, когда она склонилась над ним с неслышными тайными словами, веяло сыростью могильного тлена[].Ее стекленеющие глаза уставились из глубин смерти, поколебать и сломить мою душу. На меня одного. Призрачная свеча освещает ее агонию. Призрачные блики на искаженном мукой лице. Громко раздается ее дыхание, хриплое, прерывающееся от ужаса, и, став на колени, все молятся. Взгляд ее на мне, повергнуть меня.      :     []; Упырь! Трупоед![]Нет, мать. Отпусти меня. Дай мне жить. Эгей, Клинк!Голос Быка Маллигана раздался певуче в глубине башни, приблизился, долетев от лестницы, позвал снова. Стивен, еще содрогаясь от вопля своей души, услышал теплый, щедрый солнечный свет и в воздухе за своей спиной дружеские слова. Будь паинькой, спускайся, Дедал. Завтрак готов. Хейнс извиняется за то, что мешал нам спать. Все улажено. Иду,  сказал Стивен, оборачиваясь. Давай, Христа ради,  говорил Маллиган.  И ради меня, и ради всеобщего блага.Его голова нырнула и вынырнула. Я ему передал про твой символ ирландского искусства. Говорит, очень остроумно. Вытяни из него фунт, идет? То бишь, гинею. Мне заплатят сегодня,  сказал Стивен. В школьной шарашке?  осведомился Маллиган.  А сколько? Четыре фунта? Одолжи нам один. Как угодно,  отвечал Стивен. Четыре сверкающих соверена!  вскричал с восторгом Бык Маллиган.  Устроим роскошный выпивон на зависть всем раздруидам. Четыре всемогущих соверена.Воздев руки, он затопал по каменным ступеням вниз, фальшиво распевая с лондонским простонародным акцентом:Веселье будет допоздна,Мы хлопнем виски и вина,В день КоронацииМы славно покутим!Веселье будет допоздна,И все мы покутим!Лучи солнца веселились над морем. Забытая никелевая чашка для бритья поблескивала на парапете. Почему я должен ее относить? Может, оставить тут на весь день, памятником забытой дружбе?Он подошел к ней, подержал с минуту в руках, осязая ее прохладу, чувствуя запах липкой пены с торчащим в ней помазком. Так прежде я носил кадило в Клонгоузе. Сейчас я другой и все-таки еще тот же. Опять слуга. Прислужник слуги[].В мрачном сводчатом помещении внутри башни фигура в халате бодро сновала у очага, то скрывая, то открывая желтое его пламя. Мягкий дневной свет падал двумя снопами через высокие оконца на вымощенный плитами пол, и там, где снопы встречались, плыло, медленно вращаясь, облако дыма от горящего угля и горелого жира. Этак мы задохнемся,  заметил Бык Маллиган.  Хейнс, вы не откроете дверь?Стивен поставил бритвенную чашку на шкафчик. Долговязый человек, сидевший на подвесной койке, направился к порогу и отворил внутреннюю дверь. А у вас есть ключ?  спросил голос. Ключ у Дедала,  отозвался Бык Маллиган.  Черти лохматые, я уже задыхаюсь!Не отрывая взгляда от очага, он взревел: Клинк! Ключ в скважине,  сказал Стивен, подходя ближе.Ключ с резким скрежетом дважды повернулся в замке, и тяжелая наружная дверь впустила долгожданные свет и воздух. Хейнс остановился в дверях, глядя наружу. Стивен придвинул к столу свой чемодан, поставив его торчком, и уселся ждать. Бык Маллиган шваркнул жарево на блюдо рядом с собой. Потом отнес блюдо и большой чайник к столу, поставил и вздохнул с облегчением. Ах, я вся таю,  произнес он,  как сказала свечка, когда Но  тес! Про это не будем. Клинк, проснись! Подавай хлеб, масло, мед. Присоединяйтесь, Хейнс. Кормежка готова. Благослови, Господи, нас и эти дары твои. Черт побери, молока нет!Стивен достал из шкафчика масленку, хлеб и горшочек с медом. Бык Маллиган, усевшись, вскипел внезапным негодованием. Что за бардак?  возмутился он.  Я ж ей сказал  прийти в начале девятого. Можно и без молока обойтись,  сказал Стивен.  В шкафчике есть лимон. Да пошел ты со своими парижскими замашками!  отвечал Бык Маллиган.  Я хочу молочка из Сэндикоува.Хейнс, направляясь к ним от дверей, сообщил: Идет ваша молочница с молоком. Благодать божия!  воскликнул Бык Маллиган, вскакивая со стула.  Присаживайтесь. Наливайте чай. Сахар в пакете. А с треклятой яичницей я больше не желаю возиться.Он кое как раскромсал жарево на блюде и раскидал его по трем тарелкам, приговаривая:        [].Хейнс сел и принялся разливать чай. Кладу всем по два куска,  сказал он.  Слушайте, Маллиган, какой вы крепкий завариваете!Бык Маллиган, нарезая хлеб щедрыми ломтями, замурлыкал умильным старушечьим голоском: Как надоть мне чай заваривать, уж я так заварю, говаривала матушка Гроган[]. А надоть нужду справлять, уж так справлю. Боже правый, вот это чай,  сказал Хейнс.Бык Маллиган, нарезая хлеб, так же умильно продолжал: Уж такой мой обычай, миссис Кахилл , это она говорит. А миссис Кахилл на это: Ахти, сударыня, только упаси вас Господи делать оба дела в одну посудину .На кончике ножа он протянул каждому из сотрапезников по толстому ломтю хлеба. Это же фольклор,  сказал он очень серьезно,  это для вашей книги, Хейнс. Пять строчек текста и десять страниц комментариев насчет фольклора и рыбообразных божеств Дандрама. Издано сестрами-колдуньями в год великого урагана[].Он обернулся к Стивену и, подняв брови, спросил его с крайней заинтересованностью: Не можете ли напомнить, коллега, где говорится про посудину матушки Гроган, в Мабиногионе[] или в упанишадах? Отнюдь не уверен,  солидно отвечал Стивен. В самом деле?  продолжал Бык Маллиган прежним тоном.  А отчего же, будьте любезны? Мне думается,  сказал Стивен, не прерывая еды,  этого не найти ни в Мабиногионе, ни за его пределами. Матушка Гроган, по всей вероятности, состоит в родстве с Мэри Энн.Бык Маллиган расплылся от удовольствия. Прелестно!  произнес он сюсюкающим и слащавым голосом, показывая белые зубы и жмурясь довольно.  Вы так полагаете? Совершенно прелестно!Затем, вдруг нарочито нахмурясь, он хрипло, скрипуче зарычал, рьяно нарезая новые ломти:На старуху Мэри ЭннЕй плевать с высоких стен,Но, задравши свой подолНабив рот яичницей, он жевал и мычал.В дверях, заслоняя свет, появилась фигура женщины. Молоко, сэр! Заходите, сударыня,  сказал Маллиган.  Клинк, подай-ка кувшин.Старушка вошла и остановилась около Стивена. Славное утречко, сэр,  сказала она.  Слава Богу. Кому-кому?  спросил Маллиган, поглядев на нее.  Ах да, конечно!Стивен, протянув руку за спину, достал из шкафчика молочный кувшин. Наши островитяне,  заметил Маллиган Хейнсу как бы вскользь,  нередко поминают сборщика крайней плоти[]. Сколько, сэр?  спросила старушка. Одну кварту,  ответил Стивен.Он смотрел, как она наливает в мерку, а оттуда в кувшин, густое белое молоко, не свое. Старые сморщенные груди. Она налила еще мерку с избытком.Древняя и таинственная, она явилась из утреннего мира, быть может, вестницей. Наливая молоко, она расхваливала его. В сочных лугах, чуть свет, она уже доила, сидя на корточках, ведьма на поганке, скрюченные пальцы проворны у набухшего вымени. Мычанием встречала ее привычный приход скотинка, шелковая от росы. Бедная старушка, шелковая коровка  такие прозвища давались ей в старину[]. Старуха-странница, низший род бессмертных, служащая своему захватчику и своему беззаботному обманщику, познавшая измену обоих, вестница тайны утра. Служить или укорять, он не знал; однако гнушался заискивать перед нею. И впрямь прекрасное, сударыня,  согласился Бык Маллиган, наливая им в чашки молоко. Вы, сэр, отведайте,  сказала она.Уступая ей, он сделал глоток. Если бы все мы могли питаться такой вот здоровой пищей,  объявил он звучно,  в этой стране не было бы столько гнилых зубов и гнилых кишок. А то живем в болоте, едим дешевую дрянь, а улицы вымощены навозом, пылью и чахоточными плевками. А вы, сэр, на доктора учитесь?  спросила старушка. Да, сударыня,  ответил Бык Маллиган.Стивен слушал, храня презрительное молчание. Она покорно внимает зычному голосу своего костоправа и врачевателя, меня она знать не знает.Голосу, который отпустит ей грехи и помажет для погребения ее тело, кроме женских нечистых чресл, сотворенное из плоти мужской не по подобию Божию, в добычу змею. И тому голосу, что сейчас заставляет ее умолкнуть, с удивлением озираясь. Вы понимаете, что он говорит?  осведомился у нее Стивен. Это вы по-французски, сэр?  спросила старушка Хейнса.Хейнс с апломбом обратил к ней новую тираду, еще длинней. Это по-ирландски,  объяснил Бык Маллиган.  Вы гэльский знаете? Я так и думала по звуку, это ирландский,  сказала она.  А вы не с запада, сэр[]? Я англичанин,  ответил Хейнс. Он англичанин,  повторил Бык Маллиган,  и он считает, в Ирландии надо говорить по-ирландски. Нет спору, надо,  сказала старушка,  мне и самой стыд, что не умею на нашем языке. А люди умные говорят, язык-то великий. Великий  это не то слово,  заявил Бык Маллиган.  Он абсолютно великолепен. Плесни нам еще чайку, Клинк. Не хотите ли чашечку, сударыня? Нет, сэр, спасибо,  отвечала старушка, повесив на руку бидон и собираясь идти.Хейнс обратился к ней: А счет у вас есть? Маллиган, надо бы заплатить, верно?Стивен снова наполнил чашки. Счет, сэр?  неуверенно переспросила она.  Это значит, семь дней по пинте по два пенса это семь раз по два это шиллинг два пенса да эти три дня по кварте по четыре пенса будет три кварты это выходит шиллинг да там один и два всего два и два, сэр.Бык Маллиган вздохнул и, отправив в рот горбушку, густо намазанную маслом с обеих сторон, вытянул вперед ноги и начал рыться в карманах. Платить подобает с любезным видом,  сказал улыбаясь Хейнс.Стивен налил третью чашку, слегка закрасив ложечкой чая густое жирное молоко. Бык Маллиган выудил из кармана флорин и, повертев его в пальцах, воскликнул: О, чудо!Он пододвинул флорин по столу к старушке, приговаривая: Радость моя, для тебя все, что имею, отдам[].Стивен вложил монету в ее нежадную руку. За нами еще два пенса,  заметил он. Это не к спеху, сэр,  уверяла она, убирая монету.  Совсем не к спеху. Всего вам доброго, сэр.Поклонившись, она ушла, напутствуемая нежным речитативом Быка Маллигана: Я бы с восторгом весь мирК милым повергнул стопам.Он обернулся к Стивену и сказал: Серьезно, Дедал. Я совсем на мели. Беги в свою школьную шарашку да принеси оттуда малость деньжонок. Сегодня бардам положено пить и пировать. Ирландия ожидает, что в этот день каждый выполнит свой долг[]. Что до меня,  заметил Хейнс, поднимаясь,  то я должен сегодня посетить вашу национальную библиотеку. Сперва поплавать,  заявил Бык Маллиган.Он обернулся к Стивену и самым учтивым тоном спросил: Не сегодня ли, Клинк, день твоего ежемесячного омовения?И пояснил, обращаясь к Хейнсу: Оный нечистый бард имеет правило мыться один раз в месяц. Всю Ирландию омывает Гольфстрим,  промолвил Стивен, поливая хлеб струйкой меда.Хейнс отозвался из угла, легким узлом повязывая шейный платок под открытым воротом спортивной рубашки: Я буду собирать ваши изречения, если вы позволите.Обращено ко мне. Они моются, банятся, оттираются. Жагала сраму[]. Совесть. А пятно все на месте[]. Это отлично сказано, что треснувшее зеркало служанки  символ ирландского искусства.Бык Маллиган, толкнув Стивена ногой под столом, задушевно пообещал: Погодите, Хейнс, вот вы еще послушаете его о Гамлете. Нет, я в самом деле намерен,  продолжал Хейнс, обращаясь к Стивену.  Я как раз думал на эту тему, когда пришло это ветхое создание. А я что-нибудь заработаю на этом?  спросил Стивен.Хейнс рассмеялся и сказал, снимая мягкую серую шляпу с крюка, на котором была подвешена койка: Чего не знаю, того не знаю.Неторопливо он направился к двери. Бык Маллиган перегнулся к Стивену и грубо, с нажимом прошипел: Не можешь без своих штучек. Для чего ты это ему? А что?  возразил Стивен.  Задача  раздобыть денег. У кого? У него или у молочницы. По-моему, орел или решка. Я про тебя ему уши прожужжал,  не отставал Бык Маллиган,  а тут извольте, ты со своим вшивым злопамятством да замогильными иезуитскими шуточками. У меня нет особой надежды,  заметил Стивен,  как на него, так и на нее.Бык Маллиган трагически вздохнул и положил руку Стивену на плечо. Лишь на меня, Клинк,  произнес он.И совсем другим голосом добавил: Честно признаться, я и сам считаю, ты прав. На хрена они, кроме этого, сдались. Чего ты их не морочишь, как я? Пошли они все к ляду. Надо выбираться из этого бардака.Он встал, важно распустил пояс и совлек с себя свой халат, произнося отрешенным тоном: И был Маллиган разоблачен от одежд его[].Содержимое карманов он выложил на стол со словами: Вот тебе твой соплюшник.И, надевая жесткий воротничок и строптивый галстук, стыдил их и укорял, а с ними и запутавшуюся часовую цепочку. Руки его, нырнув в чемодан, шарили там, покуда он требовал себе чистый носовой платок. Жагала сраму. Клянусь богом, мы же обязаны поддерживать репутацию. Желаю бордовые перчатки и зеленые башмаки. Противоречие. Я противоречу себе[]? Ну что же, значит, я противоречу себе. Ветреник Малахия. Его говорливые руки метнули мягкий черный снаряд. И вот твоя шляпа, в стиле Латинского Квартала.Стивен поймал ее и надел на голову. Хейнс окликнул их от дверей: Друзья, вы двигаетесь? Я готов,  отозвался Бык Маллиган, идя к двери.  Пошли, Клинк. Кажется, ты уже все доел после нас.Отрешенный и важный, проследовал он к порогу, не без прискорбия сообщая: И, пойдя вон, плюхнулся с горки.Стивен, взяв ясеневую тросточку, стоявшую у стены, тронулся за ним следом. Выйдя на лестницу, он притянул неподатливую стальную дверь и запер ее. Гигантский ключ сунул во внутренний карман.У подножия лестницы Бык Маллиган спросил: А ты ключ взял? Да, он у меня,  отвечал Стивен, перегоняя их.Он шел вперед. За спиной у себя он слышал, как Бык Маллиган сбивает тяжелым купальным полотенцем верхушки папоротников или трав. Кланяйтесь, сэр. Да как вы смеете, сэр.Хейнс спросил: А вы платите аренду за башню? Двенадцать фунтов,  ответил Бык Маллиган. Военному министру,  добавил Стивен через плечо.Они приостановились, покуда Хейнс разглядывал башню. Потом он заметил: Зимой унылое зрелище, надо думать. Как она называется, Мартелло? Их выстроили по указанию Билли Питта[],  сказал Бык Маллиган,  когда с моря угрожали французы. Но наша  это омфал. И какие же у вас идеи о Гамлете?  спросил у Стивена Хейнс. О нет!  воскликнул страдальчески Бык Маллиган.  Я этого не выдержу, я вам не Фома Аквинат, измысливший пятьдесят пять причин. Дайте мне сперва принять пару кружек.Он обернулся к Стивену, аккуратно одергивая лимонный жилет: Тебе ж самому для такого надо не меньше трех, правда, Клинк? Это уж столько ждет,  ответил тот равнодушно,  может и еще подождать. Вы разжигаете мое любопытство,  любезно заметил Хейнс.  Тут какой-нибудь парадокс? Фу!  сказал Маллиган.  Мы уже переросли Уайльда и парадоксы. Все очень просто. Он с помощью алгебры доказывает, что внук Гамлета  дедушка Шекспира, а сам он призрак собственного отца. Как-как?  переспросил Хейнс, показывая было на Стивена.  Вот он сам?Бык Маллиган накинул полотенце на шею наподобие столы патера и, корчась от смеха, шепнул на ухо Стивену: О, тень Клинка-старшего! Иафет в поисках отца[]! Мы по утрам усталые,  сказал Стивен Хейнсу.  А это довольно долго рассказывать.Бык Маллиган, снова зашагавший вперед, воздел руки к небу. Только священная кружка способна развязать Дедалу язык,  объявил он. Я хочу сказать,  Хейнс принялся объяснять Стивену на ходу,  эта башня и эти скалы мне чем-то напоминают Эльсинор. Выступ утеса[] грозного, нависшего над морем, не так ли?Бык Маллиган на миг неожиданно обернулся к Стивену, но ничего не сказал. В этот сверкнувший безмолвный миг Стивен словно увидел свой облик, в пыльном дешевом трауре, рядом с их яркими одеяниями. Это удивительная история,  сказал Хейнс, опять останавливая их.Глаза, светлые, как море под свежим ветром, еще светлей, твердые и сторожкие. Правитель морей, он смотрел на юг, через пустынный залив, где лишь маячил смутно на горизонте дымный плюмаж далекого пакетбота да парусник лавировал у банки Маглине. Я где-то читал богословское истолкование,  произнес он в задумчивости.  Идея Отца и Сына. Сын, стремящийся к воссоединению с Отцом.Бык Маллиган немедля изобразил ликующую физиономию с ухмылкою до ушей.Он поглядел на них, блаженно разинув красивый рот, и глаза его, в которых он тут же пригасил всякую мысль, моргали с полоумным весельем. Он помотал туда-сюда болтающейся башкой болванчика, тряся полями круглой панамы, и запел дурашливым, бездумно веселым голосом:Я юноша странный, каких поискать[],Отец мой был птицей, еврейкою  мать.С Иосифом-плотником жить я не стал.Бродяжничал и на Голгофу попал.Он предостерегающе поднял палец:А кто говорит, я не бог, тем плутамВинца, что творю из воды, я не дам.Пусть пьют они воду, и тайна ясна,Как снова я воду творю из вина.Быстрым прощальным жестом он подергал за Стивенову тросточку и устремился вперед, к самому краю утеса, хлопая себя по бокам, как будто плавниками или крыльями, готовящимися взлететь, и продолжая свое пение:Прощай же и речи мои запиши,О том, что воскрес я, везде расскажи.Мне плоть не помеха, коль скоро я бог,Лечу я на небо Прощай же, дружок!Выделывая антраша, он подвигался на их глазах к сорокафутовому провалу, махая крылоподобными руками, легко подскакивая, и шляпа ветреника колыхалась на свежем ветру, доносившем до них его отрывистые птичьи крики.Хейнс, который посмеивался весьма сдержанно, идя рядом со Стивеном, заметил: Мне кажется, тут не стоит смеяться. Он сильно богохульствует. Впрочем, я лично не из верующих. С другой стороны, его веселье как-то придает всему безобидность, не правда ли? Как это у него называется? Иосиф-плотник? Баллада об Иисусе-шутнике,  буркнул Стивен. Так вы это раньше слышали?  спросил Хейнс. Каждый день три раза, после еды,  последовал сухой ответ. Но вы сами-то не из верующих?  продолжал расспрашивать Хейнс.  Я хочу сказать: верующих в узком смысле слова. Творение из ничего, чудеса, Бог как личность. Мне думается, у этого слова всего один смысл,  сказал Стивен.Остановясь, Хейнс вынул серебряный портсигар с мерцающим зеленым камнем. Нажав на пружину крышки большим пальцем, он раскрыл его и протянул Стивену. Спасибо,  отозвался тот, беря сигарету.Хейнс взял другую себе и снова защелкнул крышку. Спрятав обратно портсигар, он вынул из жилетного кармана никелированную трутницу, тем же манером раскрыл ее, прикурил и, заслонив язычок пламени ладонью, подставил Стивену. Да, конечно,  проговорил он, когда они пошли дальше.  Вы либо веруете, либо нет, верно? Лично я не мог бы переварить идею личного Бога. Надеюсь, вы ее не придерживаетесь? Вы видите во мне,  произнес Стивен мрачно и недовольно,  пример ужасающего вольнодумства.Он шел, выжидая продолжения разговора, держа сбоку ясеневую тросточку.Ее кованый наконечник легко чертил по тропинке, поскрипывая у ног. Мой дружочек следом за мной, с тоненьким зовом: Стииииии-вии! Волнистая линия вдоль тропинки. Они пройдут по ней вечером, затемно возвращаясь. Он хочет ключ. Ключ мой, я плачу аренду. Но я ем хлеб его, что горестен устам[].Отдай и ключ. Все отдай. Он спросит про него. По глазам было видно. В конечном счете  начал Хейнс.Стивен обернулся и увидал, что холодный взгляд, смеривший его, был не таким уж недобрым. В конечном счете, мне кажется, вы способны достичь свободы. Похоже, что вы сами себе господин. Я слуга двух господ,  отвечал Стивен,  или, если хотите, госпож, англичанки и итальянки. Итальянки?  переспросил Хейнс.Полоумная королева, старая и ревнивая. На колени передо мной. А некто третий,  продолжал Стивен,  желает, чтобы я был у него на побегушках. Итальянки?  спросил снова Хейнс.  Что это значит? Британской империи,  пояснил Стивен, покраснев,  и Римской святой соборной и апостольской церкви.Прежде чем заговорить, Хейнс снял с нижней губы приставшие крошки табака. Вполне понимаю вас,  спокойно заметил он.  Я бы даже сказал, для ирландца естественно так думать. Мы в Англии сознаем, что обращались с вами несправедливо. Но повинна тут, видимо, история.Гордые полновластные титулы прозвучали в памяти Стивена победным звоном медных колоколов:       [] неспешный рост, вызревание догматов и обрядов, как его собственных заветных мыслей, химия звезд. Апостольский символ[] в мессе папы Марцеллия[], голоса сливаются в мощное утверждающее соло, и под их пение недреманный ангел церкви воинствующей обезоруживал ересиархов и грозил им.Орды ересей в скособоченных митрах разбегаются наутек: Фотий, орава зубоскалов, средь коих и Маллиган, Арий, воевавший всю жизнь против единосущия Сына Отцу, Валентин, что гнушался земным естеством Христа, и хитроумный ересиарх из Африки, Савеллий, по чьим утверждениям Отец Сам был собственным Сыном[].Слова, которые только что сказал Маллиган, зубоскаля над чужеземцем.Пустое зубоскальство. Неизбежная пустота ожидает их, всех, что ткут ветер[]: угрозу, обезоруживанье и поражение несут им стройные боевые порядки ангелов церкви, воинство Михаила[], в пору раздоров всегда встающее на ее защиту с копьями и щитами.Браво, бис! Продолжительные аплодисменты. !   ![] Я, разумеется, британец,  продолжал голос Хейнса,  и мыслю я соответственно. К тому же мне вовсе не хочется увидеть свою страну в руках немецких евреев. Боюсь, что сейчас это главная опасность для нашей нации.Двое, наблюдая, стояли на краю обрыва  делец и лодочник. Плывет в Баллок.Лодочник с неким пренебрежением кивнул на север залива. Там будет саженей пять[],  сказал он.  Туда его и вынесет после часу, когда прилив начнется. Нынче девятый день.Про утопленника. Парус кружит по пустынной бухте, поджидая, когда вынырнет раздутый мешок и обернет к солнцу солью беленное вспученное лицо.А вот и я.Извилистой тропкой они спустились к неширокому заливчику. Бык Маллиган стоял на камне без пиджака, отшпиленный галстук струился по ветру за плечом. Поблизости от него юноша, держась за выступ скалы, медленно по-лягушачьи разводил зелеными ногами в студенистой толще воды. А брат с тобой, Мэйлахи? Да нет, он в Уэстмите, у Бэннонов. Все еще? Мне Бэннон прислал открытку. Говорит, подцепил себе там одну молоденькую. Фотодевочка, он ее так зовет. Заснял, значит? С короткой выдержкой?Бык Маллиган уселся снять башмаки. Из-за выступа скалы высунулось красное отдувающееся лицо. Пожилой мужчина вылез на камни, вода блестела на его лысине с седоватым венчиком, вода струилась по груди, по брюху, капала с черных мешковатых трусов.Бык Маллиган посторонился, пропуская его, и, бросив взгляд на Хейнса и Стивена, ногтем большого пальца[] набожно перекрестил себе лоб, уста и грудную клетку. А Сеймур опять в городе,  сказал юноша, ухватившись снова за выступ.  Медицину побоку, решил в армию. Да иди ты,  хмыкнул Бык Маллиган. На той неделе уже в казарму. А ты знаешь ту рыженькую из Карлайла, Лили? Знаю. Прошлый вечер на пирсе с ним обжималась. У папаши денег до черта. Может, она залетела? Это ты Сеймура спроси. Сеймур  кровопускающий офицер!  объявил Бык Маллиган.Кивнув самому себе, он стянул с ног брюки, выпрямился и изрек избитую истину: Рыжие бабы блудливы как козы.Встревоженно оборвав, принялся щупать свои бока под вздувшейся от ветра рубашкой. У меня нет двенадцатого ребра[],  возопил он.  Я []. Беззубый Клинк и я, мы сверхчеловеки.Он выпутался из рубашки и кинул ее к вороху остальной одежды. Здесь залезаешь, Мэйлахи? Ага. Дай-ка местечко на кровати.Юноша в воде оттолкнулся назад и в два сильных, ровных гребка выплыл на середину заливчика. Хейнс с сигаретой присел на камень. А вы не будете?  спросил Бык Маллиган. Попозже,  отвечал Хейнс.  После завтрака не сразу.Стивен повернулся идти. Я ухожу, Маллиган,  сказал он. А дай-ка тот ключ, Клинк,  сказал Бык Маллиган,  мою рубашку прижать.Стивен протянул ему ключ. Бык Маллиган положил его на ворох одежды. И двухпенсовик на пинту. Кидай туда же.Стивен кинул два пенса на мягкий ворох. Одеваются, раздеваются. Бык Маллиган, выпрямившись, сложив перед грудью руки, торжественно произнес: Крадущий у бедного дает взаймы Господу[]. Так говорил Заратустра.Жирное тело нырнуло в воду. Еще увидимся,  сказал Хейнс, повернувшись к уходящему Стивену и улыбаясь необузданности ирландцев.Бычьих рогов, конских копыт и улыбки сакса[]. В Корабле!  крикнул Бык Маллиган.  В полпервого. Ладно,  ответил Стивен.Он шел по тропинке, что вилась вверх.  .  .Седой нимб священника за скалой, куда тот скромно удалился для одевания. Сегодня я не буду здесь ночевать. Домой идти тоже не могу.Зов, протяжный и мелодичный, донесся до него с моря. На повороте тропинки он помахал рукой. Голос донесся снова. Лоснящаяся темная голова, тюленья, далеко от берега, круглая.Захватчик.Эпизод [] Кокрейн, ты скажи. Какой город послал за ним? Тарент, сэр. Правильно. А потом? Потом было сражение, сэр. Правильно. А где?Мальчуган с пустым выражением уставился в пустоту окна.Басни дочерей памяти. Но ведь чем -то и непохоже на басни памяти. Тогда  фраза, сказанная в сердцах, шум Блейковых крыл избытка[]. Слышу, как рушатся пространства, обращаются в осколки стекло и камень, и время охвачено сине-багровым пламенем конца. Что же нам остается? Я позабыл место, сэр. В  году до нашей эры. Аскулум,  бросил Стивен, заглянув в книгу с рубцами кровопролитий. Да, сэр. И он сказал: еще одна такая победа  и мы погибли[].Вот эту фразу мир и запомнил. Утеха для скудоумных. Над усеянной телами равниной, опершись на копье, генерал обращается с холма к офицерам. Любой генерал к любым офицерам. А те внимают. Теперь ты, Армстронг,  сказал Стивен.  А каков был конец Пирра? Конец Пирра, сэр? Я знаю, сэр. Спросите меня, сэр,  вызвался Комин. Нет, ты обожди. Армстронг. Ты что-нибудь знаешь о Пирре?В ранце у Армстронга уютно притаился кулек с вялеными фигами. Время от времени он разминал их в ладонях и отправлял потихоньку в рот. Крошки, приставшие к кожице на губах. Подслащенное мальчишеское дыхание.Зажиточная семья, гордятся, что старший сын во флоте. Викс-роуд, Долки. О Пирре, сэр? Пирр  это пирс.Все засмеялись. Визгливый, злорадный смех без веселья. Армстронг обвел взглядом класс, дурашливая ухмылка на профиле. Сейчас совсем разойдутся, знают, что мне их не приструнить, а плату их папаши внесли. Тогда объясни,  сказал Стивен, касаясь плеча мальчугана книжкой,  что это такое, пирс. Ну, пирс, сэр,  тянул Армстронг.  Такая штука над морем. Вроде как мост. В Кингстауне пирс, сэр.Кое кто засмеялся снова, без веселья, но со значением. Двое на задней парте начали перешептываться. Да. Они знали: никогда не изведав, никогда не были невинны. Все. Он с завистью оглядел их лица. Эдит, Этель, Герти, Лили. Похожи на этих: дыхание тоже подслащенное от чая с вареньем, браслеты звякают во время возни. Кингстаунский пирс,  повторил Стивен.  Да, несбывшийся мост.Их взгляды смутились от его слов. Как это, сэр?  спросил Комин.  Мост, он же через реку.Хейнсу в его цитатник. Не для этих ушей. Вечером, среди пьянки и пустословия, пронзить, словно пирс воду, ровную гладь его ума. А что в том? Шут при господском дворе, благоволимый и презираемый, добился от господина милостивой похвалы. Почему все они выбрали эту роль? Не только ведь ради ласки и поощрения. Для них тоже история  это сказка, давно навязшая в ушах, а своя страна  закладная лавка[].Разве Пирр не пал в Аргосе от руки старой ведьмы[], а Юлия Цезаря не закололи кинжалом? Их уже не изгнать из памяти. Время поставило на них свою мету[] и заключило, сковав, в пространстве, что занимали уничтоженные ими бесчисленные возможности. Но были ль они возможны, если их так и не было? Или то лишь было возможным, что состоялось? Тките, ветра ткачи. Сэр, а расскажите нам что-нибудь. Ага, сэр, про привидения. Где мы остановились тут?  спросил Стивен, открывая другую книгу. "Оставь рыданья"[],  сказал Комин. Ну, давай, Толбот. А историю, сэр? Потом,  сказал Стивен.  Давай, Толбот.Смуглый мальчуган раскрыл книгу и ловко приладил ее за укрытием своего ранца. Он начал читать стихотворение, запинаясь и часто подглядывая в текст:Оставь рыданья, о пастух, оставь рыданья,Ликид не умирал, напрасна скорбь твоя,Хотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертаньяТогда это должно быть движением, актуализация возможного как такового.Фраза Аристотеля сложилась из бормотанья ученика и поплыла вдаль, в ученую тишину[] библиотеки Святой Женевьевы, где он читал, огражден от греховного Парижа, вечер за вечером. Рядом хрупкий сиамец штудировал учебник стратегии. Вокруг меня насыщенные и насыщающиеся мозги  пришпиленные под лампочками, слабо подрагивающие щупиками,  а во тьме моего ума грузное подземное чудище, неповоротливое, боящееся света, шевелит драконовой чешуей. Мысль  это мысль о мысли. Безмятежная ясность. Душа  это, неким образом, все сущее: душа  форма форм[]. Безмятежность нежданная, необъятная, лучащаяся: форма форм.Толбот твердил:И дивной властию того,кто шел по водам,И дивной властию Можешь перевернуть,  сказал Стивен безразлично.  Я ничего не вижу. Чего, сэр?  спросил простодушно Толбот, подаваясь вперед.Его рука перевернула страницу. Он снова выпрямился и продолжал, как будто припомнив. О том, кто шел по водам. И здесь лежит его тень, на этих малодушных сердцах, и на сердце безбожника, на его устах, на моих. Она и на снедаемых любопытством лицах тех, что предложили ему динарий[]. Кесарево кесарю, а Божие Богу. Долгий взгляд темных глаз, загадочные слова, что без конца будут ткаться на кроснах церкви. Да.Отгадай загадку, будешь молодец:Зернышки посеять мне велел отец.Толбот закрыл книжку и сунул ее в ранец. Все уже?  спросил Стивен. Да, сэр. В десять хоккей, сэр. Короткий день, сэр. Четверг. А кто отгадает загадку?  спросил Стивен.Они распихивали учебники, падали карандаши, шуршали страницы.Сгрудившись вместе, защелкивали и затягивали ранцы, разом весело тараторя: Загадку, сэр? Давайте я, сэр. Я, дайте я, сэр. Какую потрудней, сэр. Загадка такая,  сказал Стивен.Кочет поет.Чист небосвод.Колокол в небеОдиннадцать бьет.Бедной душе на небесаЧас улетать настает[]. Отгадайте, что это. Чего -чего, сэр? Еще разок, сэр. Мы не расслышали.Глаза их расширились, когда он повторил строчки. Настала пауза, а потом Кокрейн попросил: Скажите отгадку, сэр. Мы сдаемся.Стивен, чувствуя подкативший к горлу комок, ответил: Это лис хоронит свою бабку под остролистом.Нервически рассмеявшись, он встал, и эхом ему нестройно раздались их возгласы разочарования.В дверь стукнули клюшкой, и голос из коридора прокричал: Хоккей!Они кинулись как оголтелые, боком выскакивая из -за парт, перемахивая через сиденья. Вмиг комната опустела, и из раздевалки послышался их гомон и грохот клюшек и башмаков.Сарджент, единственный, кто остался, медленно подошел, протягивая раскрытую тетрадь. Его спутанные волосы и тощая шея выдавали явную неготовность, слабые глаза в запотевших очках глядели просяще. На блеклой бескровной щеке расплылось чернильное пятно в форме финика, еще свежее и влажное, как след слизня.Он подал тетрадку. Наверху страницы было выведено: Примеры. Дальше шли цифры вкривь и вкось, а внизу имелся корявый росчерк с загогулинами и с кляксой. Сирил Сарджент: личная подпись и печать. Мистер Дизи велел все снова переписать и показать вам, сэр.Стивен потрогал края тетрадки. Что толку. Ты уже понял, как их решать?  спросил он. С одиннадцатого до пятнадцатого,  отвечал Сарджент.  Мистер Дизи сказал, надо было списать с доски, сэр. А сам теперь сможешь сделать? Нет, сэр.Уродлив и бестолков: худая шея, спутанные волосы, пятно на щеке  след слизня. Но ведь какая-то любила его, выносила под сердцем, нянчила на руках. Если бы не она, мир в своей гонке давно подмял бы его, растоптал, словно бескостого слизня. А она любила его жидкую слабосильную кровь, взятую у нее самой. Значит, это и есть настоящее[]? Единственно истинное в жизни? В святом своем рвении пламенный Колумбан[] перешагнул через тело матери, простершейся перед ним. Ее не стало: дрожащий остов ветки, попаленной огнем, запах розового дерева и могильного тлена. Она спасла его, не дала растоптать и ушла, почти не коснувшись бытия. Бедная душа улетела на небеса  и на вересковой пустоши, под мерцающими звездами, лис, горящие беспощадные глаза, рыжим и хищным духом разит от шкуры, рыл землю, вслушивался, откидывал землю, вслушивался и рыл, рыл.Сидя с ним рядом, Стивен решал задачу. Он с помощью алгебры доказывает, что призрак Шекспира  это дедушка Гамлета. Сарджент глядел искоса через съехавшие очки. Из раздевалки стук клюшек; с поля голоса и глухие удары по мячу.Значки на странице изображали чопорный мавританский танец, маскарад букв в причудливых шляпах квадратов и кубов. Подача руки, поворот, поклон партнеру: вот так: бесовские измышленья мавров. И они уже покинули мир, Аверроэс и Моисей Маймонид, мужи, темные обличьем и обхожденьем, ловящие в свои глумливые зеркала смутную душу мира, и тьма в свете светит, и свет не объемлет ее[]. Ну как, понял? Сможешь сам сделать следующий? Да, сэр.Вялыми, неуверенными движениями пера Сарджент списал условие. То и дело медля в надежде помощи, рука его старательно выводила кривые значки, слабая краска стыда проступала сквозь блеклую кожу щек.  [], родительный субъекта и объекта. Она вскормила его своей жидкой кровью и свернувшимся молоком, скрывала от чужих взоров его пеленки.Я был как он, те же косые плечи, та же нескладность Детство мое, сгорбясь подле меня. Ушло, и не коснуться его, пускай хоть раз, хоть слегка. Мое ушло, а его потаенно, как наши взгляды. Тайны, безмолвно застывшие в темных чертогах двух наших сердец: тайны, уставшие тиранствовать: тираны, мечтающие быть свергнутыми.Пример был решен. Вот видишь, как просто,  сказал Стивен, вставая. Ага, сэр, спасибо,  ответил Сарджент.Он промокнул страницу и отнес тетрадь к парте. Бери свою клюшку и ступай к ребятам,  сказал Стивен, направляясь к дверям следом за нескладной фигуркой. Ага, сэр.В коридоре послышалось его имя, его окликали с поля: Сарджент! Беги, мистер Дизи тебя зовет,  поторопил Стивен.Стоя на крыльце, он глядел, как пентюх поспешает на поле битвы, где голоса затеяли крикливую перебранку. Их разделили на команды, и мистер Дизи возвращался, шагая через метелки травы затянутыми в гетры ногами.Едва он дошел до школы, как снова заспорившие голоса позвали его назад. Он обернул к ним сердитые седые усы. Ну что еще?  прокричал он несколько раз, не слушая. Кокрейн и Холлидей в одной команде, сэр,  крикнул ему Стивен. Вы не обождете минутку у меня в кабинете,  попросил мистер Дизи,  пока я тут наведу порядок.Он озабоченно зашагал по полю обратно, строго покрикивая своим старческим голосом: В чем дело? Что там еще?Пронзительные их крики взметнулись разом со всех сторон от него; фигурки их обступили его кольцом, а слепящее солнце выбеливало мед его плохо выкрашенной головы.Прокуренный застоялый дух царил в кабинете, вместе с запахом кожи вытертых тускло-желтых кресел. Как в первый день, когда мы с ним рядились тут. Как было вначале, так и ныне. Сбоку стоял подносик с монетами Стюарта[], жалкое сокровище ирландских болот: и присно. И в футляре для ложек, на выцветшем алом плюше, двенадцать апостолов[], проповедовавших всем языкам: и во веки веков.Торопливые шаги по каменному крыльцу, в коридоре. Раздувая редкие свои усы, мистер Дизи остановился у стола. Сначала наши небольшие расчеты.Он вынул из сюртука перетянутый кожаной ленточкой бумажник. Раскрыв его, извлек две банкноты, одну  из склеенных половинок, и бережно положил на стол. Два,  сказал он, вновь перетягивая и убирая бумажник.Теперь в хранилище золотых запасов. Ладонь Стивена в неловкости блуждала по раковинам, лежавшим грудой в холодной каменной ступке: волнистые рожки, и каури, и багрянки, а эта вот закручена, как тюрбан эмира, а эта  гребешок святого Иакова. Добро старого пилигрима, мертвые сокровища, пустые ракушки.Соверен, новенький и блестящий, упал на мягкий ворс скатерти. Три,  сказал мистер Дизи, вертя в руках свою маленькую копилку.  Очень удобная штучка.  Смотрите. Вот сюда соверены. Тут шиллинги, полукроны, шестипенсовики. А сюда  кроны. Смотрите.Он высыпал на ладонь два шиллинга и две кроны. Три двенадцать,  сказал он.  По -моему, это правильно. Благодарю вас, сэр,  отвечал Стивен, с застенчивою поспешностью собирая деньги и пряча их в карман брюк. Не за что,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вы это заработали.Рука Стивена, освободившись, вернулась снова к пустым ракушкам. Тоже символы красоты и власти. Толика денег в моем кармане: символы, запятнанные алчностью и нищетой. Не надо их так носить,  предостерег мистер Дизи.  Где-нибудь вытащите и потеряете. Купите лучше такую же штуковину. Увидите, как это удобно.Отвечай что-нибудь. У меня она часто будет пустовать.Те же место и час, та же премудрость: и я тот же. Вот уже трижды. Три петли вокруг меня. Ладно. Я их могу разорвать в любой миг, если захочу. Потому что вы не откладываете,  мистер Дизи поднял вверх палец.  Вы еще не знаете, что такое деньги. Деньги  это власть. Вот поживете с мое. Уж я -то знаю. Если бы молодость знала. Как это там у Шекспира? Набей потуже кошелек. Яго,  пробормотал Стивен.Он поднял взгляд от праздных ракушек к глазам старого джентльмена. Он знал, что такое деньги,  продолжал мистер Дизи,  он их наживал. Поэт, но в то же время и англичанин. А знаете, чем англичане гордятся? Какие самые гордые слова у англичанина?Правитель морей. Холодные как море глаза смотрели на пустынную бухту -повинна история  на меня и мои слова, без ненависти. Что над его империей никогда не заходит солнце. Ха!  воскликнул мистер Дизи.  Это совсем не англичанин. Это сказал французский кельт[].Он постукал своей копилкой о ноготь большого пальца. Я вам скажу,  объявил он торжественно,  чем он больше всего хвастает и гордится: Я никому не должен.Надо же, какой молодец. "Я никому не должен. Я за всю жизнь не занял ни у кого ни шиллинга". Вам понятно такое чувство? У меня нет долгов. Понятно?Маллигану девять фунтов, три пары носков, пару обуви, галстуки. Каррэну десять гиней. Макканну гинею. Фреду Райену два шиллинга. Темплу за два обеда. Расселу гинею, Казинсу десять шиллингов, Бобу Рейнольдсу полгинеи, Келеру три гинеи, миссис Маккернан за комнату, пять недель. Малая моя толика бессильна[]. В данный момент нет,  ответил Стивен.Мистер Дизи от души рассмеялся, пряча свою копилку. Я так и думал,  сказал он весело.  Но когда-нибудь вам придется к нему прийти. Мы народ щедрый, но справедливость тоже нужна. Я боюсь этих громких слов,  сказал Стивен,  они нам приносят столько несчастий[].Мистер Дизи вперил суровый взгляд туда, где над камином пребывали дородные стати мужчины в клетчатом килте: Альберт Эдуард, принц Уэльский. Вы меня считаете старым замшелым тори,  молвил его задумчивый голос.  Со времен ОКоннелла я видел три поколения[]. Я помню голод. А вы знаете, что ложи оранжистов вели агитацию против унии за двадцать лет до того, как этим стал заниматься ОКоннелл, причем попы вашей церкви его клеймили как демагога? У вас, фениев, короткая память.Вечная, славная и благоговейная память. Алмазная ложа в Арме великолепном, заваленная трупами папистов. При оружии, в масках, плантаторы хриплыми голосами дают присягу. Черный север и истинная голубая библия. Берегись, стриженые[].Стивен сделал легкое движение. В моих жилах тоже кровь бунтарей,  продолжал мистер Дизи.  По женской линии. Но прямой мой предок  сэр Джон Блэквуд[], который голосовал за унию. Все мы ирландцы, и все потомки королей[]. Увы,  сказал Стивен.   [],  твердо произнес мистер Дизи. Это его девиз. Он голосовал за унию и ради этого натянул ботфорты и поскакал в Дублин из Нижнего Ардса.Трала  лала, трала -лала.На Дублин путь кремнист.Деревенщина-сквайр в седле, лоснящиеся ботфорты. Славный денек, сэр Джон. Славный денек, ваша честь. День-денек День-денек Ботфорты болтаются, трусят в Дублин. Трала -лала, трала -лала, трусят. Кстати, это напомнило мне,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вы бы могли оказать мне услугу через ваши литературные знакомства. У меня тут письмо в газету. Вы не присядете на минутку, я бы допечатал конец.Он подошел к письменному столу у окна, подвинул дважды свой стул и перечел несколько слов с листа, заправленного в пишущую машинку. Присаживайтесь. Прошу меня извинить,  сказал он через плечо.  Законы здравого смысла . Одну минутку.Вглядываясь из-под косматых бровей в черновик возле своего локтя и бормоча про себя, он принялся тукать по тугим клавишам машинки, медленно, иногда отдуваясь, когда приходилось возвращать валик, чтобы стереть опечатку.Стивен бесшумно уселся в присутствии августейшей особы. Развешанные по стенам в рамках, почтительно застыли изображенья канувших в Лету лошадей, уставив кверху кроткие морды: Отпор лорда Гастингса, Выстрел герцога Вестминстерского, Цейлон герцога Бофора, взявший Парижский приз в году. На седлах легкие жокеи в чутком ожиданье сигнала. Он следил за их состязанием, поставив на королевские цвета, и сливал свои крики с криками канувших в Лету толп. Точка,  дал указание клавишам мистер Дизи.  Однако скорейшее разрешение этого важного вопроса Куда Крэнли меня привел, чтобы разом разбогатеть, таскались за его фаворитами средь грязью заляпанных бреков, орущих букмекеров у стоек, трактирной вони, месива под ногами. Один к одному на Честного Мятежника, на остальных десять к одному! Мимо жуликов, мимо игроков в кости спешили мы вслед за копытами, картузами и камзолами, и мимо мяснолицей зазнобы мясника, жадно всосавшейся в апельсин[].Пронзительные крики донеслись с поля и трель свистка.Еще гол. Я среди них, в свалке их борющихся тел, на турнире жизни. Ты хочешь сказать, тот маменькин сынок, заморыш со слегка осовелым видом? Турниры. Время отражает толчок толчком, каждый раз. Турниры, грязь и рев битв, застывшая предсмертная блевотина убитых, вопль копий, наживленных кровавыми человечьими кишками. Готово,  произнес мистер Дизи, вставая с места.Он подошел к столу, скрепляя вместе свои листки. Стивен тоже поднялся. Я тут все выразил в двух словах,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Это насчет эпидемии ящура. Взгляните бегло, пожалуйста. Вопрос бесспорный.Позволю себе вторгнуться на ваши уважаемые столбцы. Пресловутая политика невмешательства, которая столь часто в нашей истории. Наша скототорговля.Судьба всех наших старинных промыслов. Ливерпульская клика, похоронившая проект Голуэйского порта[]. Европейские конфликты. Перевозки зерна через узкие проливы. Завидная невозмутимость ведомства земледелия. Не грех вспомнить классиков. Кассандра. От женщины, не блиставшей добродетелью[].Перейдем к сути дела. Я выражаюсь напрямик, вы согласны?  спросил мистер Дизи у читавшего Стивена.Эпидемия ящура. Известен как препарат Коха. Сыворотка и вирус. Процент вакцинированных лошадей. Эпизоотии. Императорские конюшни в Мюрцштеге, Нижняя Австрия. Квалифицированные ветеринары. Мистер Генри Блэквуд Прайс. Любезное предложение беспристрастной проверки. Законы здравого смысла. Вопрос чрезвычайно важен. Взять быка за рога в прямом и переносном смысле. Позвольте поблагодарить за предоставленную возможность. Я хочу, чтобы это напечатали и прочли,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вот увидите, при следующей же вспышке они наложат эмбарго на ирландский скот. А болезнь излечима. И ее лечат. Как пишет мне родственник, Блэквуд Прайс, в Австрии специалисты научились бороться с ней и надежно вылечивают. Они предлагают приехать к нам. Я пробую найти ходы в ведомстве. Сейчас попытаюсь привлечь газеты. Но всюду столько препятствий столько интриг закулисных происков, чтоПодняв указательный палец, он, прежде чем продолжать, погрозил им стариковато в воздухе. Помяните мои слова, мистер Дедал,  сказал он.  Англия в когтях у евреев. Финансы, пресса: на всех самых высоких постах. А это признак упадка нации. Всюду, где они скапливаются, они высасывают из нации соки. Я это наблюдаю не первый год. Ясно как божий день, еврейские торгаши уже ведут свою разрушительную работу. Старая Англия умирает.Он быстро отошел в сторону, и глаза его засветились голубизной, оказавшись в столбе солнечного света. Он оглянулся по сторонам. Умирает,  повторил он,  если уже не умерла.И крики шлюх глухой порой,Британия, ткут саван твой[].Глаза его, расширенные представшим видением, смотрели сурово сквозь солнечный столб, в котором он еще оставался. Но торгаш,  сказал Стивен,  это тот, кто дешево покупает и дорого продает, будь он еврей или не еврей, разве нет? Они согрешили против света,  внушительно произнес мистер Дизи.  У них в глазах тьма. Вот потому им и суждено быть вечными скитальцами по сей день.На ступенях парижской биржи златокожие люди показывают курс на пальцах с драгоценными перстнями. Гусиный гогот. Развязно и шумно толпятся в храме, под неуклюжими цилиндрами зреют замыслы и аферы. Все не их: и одежда, и речь, и жесты. Их выпуклые медлительные глаза противоречили их словам, а жесты были пылки, но незлобивы, хотя они знали об окружающей вражде и знали, что их старания тщетны. Тщетно богатеть, запасать. Время размечет все. Богатство, запасенное у дороги, его разграбят и пустят порукам. Глаза их знали годы скитаний и знали, смиренные, о бесчестье их крови. А кто нет?  спросил Стивен. Что вы хотите сказать?  не понял мистер Дизи.Он сделал шаг вперед и остановился у стола, челюсть косо отвисла в недоумении. И это мудрая старость? Он ждет, пока я ему скажу. История,  произнес Стивен,  это кошмар[], от которого я пытаюсь проснуться.На поле снова крики мальчишек. Трель свистка: гол. А вдруг этот кошмар даст тебе пинка в зад? Пути Господни неисповедимы,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Вся история движется к единой великой цели, явлению Бога.Стивен, ткнув пальцем в окошко, проговорил: Вот Бог.Урра! Эх! фью -фьюйть! Как это?  переспросил мистер Дизи. Крик на улице,  отвечал Стивен, пожав плечами[].Мистер Дизи опустил взгляд и некоторое время подержал пальцами переносицу. Потом поднял взгляд и переносицу отпустил. Я счастливей вас,  сказал он.  Мы совершили много ошибок, много грехов. Женщина принесла грех в мир. Из-за женщины, не блиставшей добродетелью, Елены, сбежавшей от Менелая, греки десять лет осаждали Трою. Неверная жена впервые привела чужеземцев на наши берега, жена Макморро[] и ее любовник ОРурк, принц Брефни. И Парнелла[] погубила женщина. Много ошибок. Много неудач, но только не главный грех. Сейчас, на склоне дней своих, я еще борец. И я буду бороться за правое дело до конца.Право свое, волю свою Ольстер добудет в бою[].Стивен поднял руку с листками. Так, значит, сэр  начал он. Сдается мне,  сказал мистер Дизи,  что вы не слишком задержитесь на этой работе. Вы не родились учителем. Хотя, возможно, я ошибаюсь. Скорее, я ученик,  сказал Стивен.А чему тебе тут учиться? Мистер Дизи покачал головой. Как знать? Ученик должен быть смиренным. Но жизнь  великий учитель.Стивен опять зашуршал листками. Так насчет этого  начал он. Да -да,  сказал мистер Дизи.  Я дал вам два экземпляра. Желательно, чтобы напечатали сразу.Телеграф. Айриш Хомстед. Я попробую,  сказал Стивен,  и завтра вам сообщу. Я немного знаком с двумя редакторами. Вот и хорошо,  живо откликнулся мистер Дизи.  Вчера вечером я написал письмо мистеру Филду, Ч.П.[]. Сегодня в гостинице Городской герб собрание Ассоциации скотопромышленников. Я его попросил огласить мое письмо в этом собрании. А вы попробуйте через ваши газеты.Это какие? "Ивнинг телеграф" Вот и хорошо,  повторил мистер Дизи.  Не будем же терять времени. Мне еще надо написать ответ тому родственнику. Всего доброго,  сказал Стивен, пряча листки в карман.  Благодарю вас. Не за что,  отозвался мистер Дизи, принимаясь рыться в бумагах у себя на столе.  Я, хоть и стар, сам люблю скрестить с вами копья. Всего доброго, сэр,  повторил Стивен, кланяясь его склоненной спине.Он вышел на крыльцо через открытые двери и зашагал под деревьями по гравийной дорожке, слыша звонкие голоса и треск клюшек. Львы покойно дремали на постаментах, когда он проходил мимо через ворота, беззубые чудища. Что ж, помогу ему в его баталии. Маллиган даст мне новое прозвище: быколюбивый бард. Мистер Дедал!Нагоняет меня. Надеюсь, не с новым письмом. Одну минутку! Да, сэр,  отозвался Стивен, поворачивая обратно к воротам.Мистер Дизи остановился, запыхавшись, дыша прерывисто и тяжело. Я только хотел добавить,  проговорил он.  Утверждают, что Ирландия, к своей чести, это единственная страна, где никогда не преследовали евреев. Вы это знаете? Нет. А вы знаете почему? Лицо его сурово нахмурилось от яркого света. Почему же, сэр?  спросил Стивен, пряча улыбку. Потому что их сюда никогда не пускали,  торжественно объявил мистер Дизи[].Ком смеха и кашля вылетел у него из горла, потянув за собой трескучую цепь мокроты. Он быстро повернул назад, кашляя и смеясь, размахивая руками над головой. Их никогда сюда не пускали!  еще раз прокричал он сквозь смех, топая по гравию дорожки затянутыми в гетры ногами.  Вот почему.Сквозь ажур листьев солнце рассыпало на его велемудрые плечи пляшущие золотые звездочки и монетки.Эпизод []Неотменимая модальность зримого[]. Хотя бы это, если не больше, говорят моей мысли мои глаза. Я здесь, чтобы прочесть отметы сути вещей: всех этих водорослей, мальков, подступающего прилива, того вон ржавого сапога.Сопливо зеленый, серебряно-синий, ржавый: цветные отметы. Пределы прозрачности. Но он добавляет: в телах. Значит, то, что тела, он усвоил раньше, чем что цветные. Как? А стукнувшись башкой об них, как еще.Осторожно. Он лысый был и миллионер,     []. Предел прозрачного в. Почему в? Прозрачное, непрозрачное. Куда пролезет вся пятерня, это ворота, куда нет  дверь. Закрой глаза и смотри.Стивен, закрыв глаза, прислушался, как хрустят хрупкие ракушки и водоросли у него под ногами. Так или иначе, ты сквозь это идешь. Иду, шажок за шажком. За малый шажок времени сквозь малый шажок пространства.Пять, шесть: это []. Совершенно верно, и это  неотменимая модальность слышимого. Открой глаза. Нет. Господи! Если я свалюсь с утеса грозного, нависшего над морем, свалюсь неотменимо сквозь []. Отлично передвигаюсь в темноте[].На боку ясеневая шпага. Постукивай ею: они так делают. Ноги мои в его башмаках и его штанинах, . Звук твердый: выковано молотом демиурга Лоса[]. Не в вечность ли я иду по берегу Сэндимаунта[]? Хруп-крак-скрип-скрип. Ракушки, деньги туземцев. Магистер Дизи в них дока.Не придешь ли в Сэндимаунт,Дороти кобылка?Смотри, вырисовывается ритм. Полный четырехстопник, шаги ямбов. Нет, галоп: роти кобылка.Теперь открой глаза. Открываю. Постой. А вдруг все исчезло за это время? Вдруг я открою и окажусь навеки в черноте непрозрачного. Дудки! Умею видеть  буду видеть.Что ж, смотри. Было на месте и без тебя; и пребудет, ныне и присно и во веки веков.Они осторожно спустились по ступеням с Лихи-террас, []; и по отлогому берегу косолапили вяло, в илистом увязая песке. Как я, как Элджи, стремятся к нашей могучей матери. У номера первого шверно[] болталась акушерская сумка, другая тыкала в песок большим зонтиком. На денек выбрались из слободки. Миссис Флоренс Маккейб, вдовица покойного Пэтка Маккейба с Брайд-стрит, горько оплакиваемого. Одна из ее товарок выволокла меня, скулящего, в жизнь. Творение из ничего. Что у нее в сумке? Выкидыш с обрывком пуповины, закутанный в рыжий лоскут. Пуповины всех идут в прошлое, единым проводом связуют-перевивают всю плоть. Вот почему монахи-мистики[]. Будете ли как боги?

Поломанные обручи у самой воды, на песке хитрая путаница почернелых сетей, подальше задние двери с каракулями мелом и выше по берегу веревка с двумя распятыми на ней рубахами.

Там солнце, гибкие деревца, лимонные домики.Париж просыпается[], поеживаясь, резкий свет солнца заливает его лимонные улицы. Дух теплых хлебцев и лягушино-зеленого абсента, фимиамы парижской заутрени, ласкают воздух.

Обращаются в осколки стекло и камень. В веселом городке Париже скрывается он, Иген Парижский, и никто не разыскивает его, кроме меня. Его дневные пристанища, обшарпанная печатня, его три трактирчика, да логово на Монмартре, где коротает он недолгие ночные часы, на рю де ла Гутт-дОр[], дорогое убранство по стенам  засиженные мухами лица ушедших.

Воспомню тебя, о Сионе[].Он подошел ближе к морю, сырой песок облепил подошвы. Свежий ветер приветно пахнул в лицо, буйный ветер, напоенный лучами, бередящий, как струны, буйные нервы. Я что, собрался идти до самого маяка? Он резко остановился, ноги тут же начали вязнуть. Назад.Повернув, он оглядел берег к югу, ноги снова начали, вязнуть, в новых лунках. Вон башня, холодная сводчатая комната ждет. Снопы света из окон безостановочно движутся, медленно и безостановочно, как вязнут ноги в песке, ползут к сумеркам по полу-циферблату. Синие сумерки, опускается ночь, синяя глубокая ночь. В сводчатой темноте они ждут, их отодвинутые стулья и мой чемодан-обелиск, вокруг стола с оставленными тарелками. Кому убирать? Ключ у него. Я не буду спать там сегодня ночью. Безмолвная башня с закрытой дверью погребла в себе их слепые тела, сахиба  охотника на пантер и его пойнтера. Зов безответен. Он вытащил увязшие ноги и двинулся назад вдоль дамбы из валунов. Все берите, владейте всем. Со мной шагает душа моя, форма форм. Так в лунные стражи торю я тропу над черно-серебристыми скалами[], слыша искусительный поток Эльсинора.Поток догоняет меня. Отсюда мне видно. Тогда возвращайся дорогой на Пулбег, от воды подальше. Он пробрался по скользким водорослям, через осоку, и уселся на скальный стул, пристроив тросточку в расселину.Вздувшийся труп собаки валялся на слое тины.

Ты не будешь ничьим господином и ничьим рабом. У меня палка. Сиди спокойно. Подальше наискось бредут к берегу из пенистого прилива чьи-то фигуры, две. Две марии[]. Надежно запрятали ее в тростниках. Ку-ку. Я тебя вижу. Нет, собаку. Бежит обратно к ним. Кто?Ладьи лохланнов[] причаливали тут к берегу в поисках добычи, кровавоклювые носы их низко скользили над расплавленным оловом прибоя.

Голод, чума и бойни. Их кровь в моих жилах, их похоти бурлят во мне. Я шел среди них по замерзшей Лиффи, другой я, подменыш, среди плюющихся смолой костров. Не говорил ни с кем; и со мной никто.Собачий лай приближался, смолкал, уносился прочь. Собака моего врага[]. Я стоял неподвижно, безмолвный, бледный, затравленный.  [].

Все потомки королей. Рай для самозванцев и тогда и теперь. Он спасал утопающих, а ты боишься визга дворняги. Но придворные, что насмехались над Гвидо в Ор-сан-Микеле, были у себя в доме[].

Когда я окунул голову в таз, в Клонгоузе. Ничего не вижу! Кто там за мной? Скорей обратно, скорей! Видишь, как быстро прилив прибывает со всех сторон, как быстро заполняет все ложбинки песков, цвета шелухи от бобов какао? Если бы под ногами была земля.

Что-то ищет, что потерял в прошлой жизни.Внезапно он помчался, как заяц, уши назад, погнавшись за тенью низко летящей чайки. Резкий свист мужчины ударил в его вислые ухи. Он повернул и помчался назад, приблизился, мелькающие лапы перешли на рысцу. В червленом поле олень бегущий, цвета природного, без рогов. У кружевной кромки прилива остановился, упершись передними копытами, насторожив уши к морю.Задравши морду, облаял шумные волны, стада моржей. Они подползали к его ногам, закручиваясь кольцами, вспенивая, каждая девятая, белый гребень, разбиваясь, расплескиваясь, издалека, из дальнего далека, волны и волны.Сборщики моллюсков. Они зашли в воду, нагнувшись, окунули свои мешки, вытащили, вышли обратно. Пес с визгом подбежал к ним, вскинулся на них лапами, потом опустил лапы на песок, потом снова вскинул их на хозяев с немою медвежеватою лаской. Оставленный без взаимности, он потрусил следом за ними на сухое, и тряпка волчьего языка краснопыхтела из пасти.Пятнистое его тело трусцой выдвинулось вперед, потом вдруг припустило телячьим галопом. Собачий труп лежал у него на пути. Он остановился, обнюхал, обошел кругом, братец, обнюхал тщательней, сделал еще один обход, быстро, по-собачьи, обнюхивая всю грязную шкуру дохлого пса. Песий череп, песий нюх, глаза в землю, движется к единой великой цели. Эх, пес-бедолага! Здесь лежит тело пса-бедолаги. Падаль! Живо оттуда, псина!Присмирев от окрика, он вернулся, и несильный пинок босой хозяйской ноги швырнул его, сжавшегося на лету, за грядку песка. Подался обратно, описав вороватую кривую. Не видит меня. У края дамбы задержался, посуетился, обнюхал валун и помочился на него, задрав заднюю ногу.Потрусил вперед, задрал снова заднюю ногу и быстро, коротко помочился на необнюханный валун. Простые радости бедняков. Потом задние лапы стали раскидывать песок; потом передние принялись грести, рыть. Что-то он тут хоронит, бабку свою. Он вгрызался в песок, разгребая, раскидывая; остановился, прислушался, снова принялся рыть яростными когтями, но вскоре перестал, леопард, пантера, зачатый в прелюбодействе, пожирающий мертвых.После того как он меня разбудил этой ночью, тот же самый сон или? Постой. Открытая дверь. Квартал проституток. Припомни. Гарун-аль-Рашид.Ага, постепенькаю. Тот человек вел меня и говорил что-то. Я не боялся. У него была дыня, он ее поднес мне к лицу.

Его посинелые ноги в подвернутых штанах шлепали по сырому липучему песку, темно-кирпичный шарф схлестнул небритую шею. Женской походкой она семенит за ним: разбойник и его девка. Добыча их болтается у нее за спиной. Босые ноги ее облеплены песком, осколками ракушек, волосы распушились вокруг обветренного лица. За своим господином его сподручница  в град столичный.Когда ночь скроет изъяны тела, она зазывает, закутанная в темную шаль, из подворотни, где гадят псы. Дружок ее угощает двух королевских стрелков у ОЛоклина на Блэкпиттсе. А подружка, это по их блатной музыке маруха, потому что Эх, фартовая маруха[]. Белизна дьяволицы под ее вонючими тряпками.

Грядет он[], бледнолицый вампир, сверкают глаза сквозь бурю, паруса, крылья нетопыря, кровавят море, уста к ее лобзающим устам.Так. Пришпилим-ка этого молодца, а? Где грифель мой[]. Уста ее в лобзанье. Нет. Надо, чтоб были двое. И склей их вместе. Уста к ее лобзающим устам.Его губы ловили и лобзали бесплотные губы воздуха: уста к тому, чем породила. Иила, лоно всех могила. Уста округлились, но выпускали одно дыхание, бессловесно: ооиииаа: рев рушащихся водопадом планет, шарообразных, раскаленных, ревущих: прочь-прроочь-прроочь-прроочь. Бумаги мне. Деньги, разрази их. Письмо старины Дизи. Вот. Благодарю за предоставленную возможность оторвать свободный клочок. Повернувшись к солнцу спиной и низко склонившись к каменному столу, он принялся строчить слова. Второй раз забываю взять чистые бланки в библиотеке.Тень его лежала на скале, над которою он склонился, оканчиваясь. А почему не бесконечна, не до самой дальней звезды? Они темны там, за пределами света, тьма в свете светит, дельта Кассиопеи, миры. Мое я сидит здесь с ясеневым жезлом жреца, в заемных сандалиях, днем возле свинцово-серого моря, незримо, в лиловой ночи движется под эгидою загадочных звезд. Я отбрасываю от себя эту оконеченную тень, неотменимый антропоконтур, призываю ее обратно. Будь бесконечна, была бы она моей, формой моей формы? Кто здесь видит меня? Кто прочтет где-нибудь и когда-нибудь слова, что я написал? Значки по белому полю. Кто-нибудь и кому-нибудь твоим самым сладкозвучным голосом. Добрый епископ Клойнский[] извлек храмовую завесу из своей пасторской шляпы: завесу пространства с цветными эмблемами, вышитыми по ее полю. Постой, подумай. Цветные на плоском: да, именно. Я вижу плоское, а мыслю расстояние, вблизи, вдали, а вижу плоское, на восток, сзади. Ага, понятно! Внезапно падает и застывает в стереоскопе. Щелк  и весь фокус. Вам кажутся темными мои слова. Тьма в наших душах, этого вам не кажется? Сладкозвучней. Наши души, стыдом язвимые за наши грехи, еще теснее льнут к нам, как женщина, льнущая к возлюбленному, теснее, еще теснее.Она доверяется мне, у нее нежная рука, глаза с длинными ресницами. Куда только, шут меня возьми, я тащу ее за завесу? В неотменимую модальность неотменимой зримости. Она, она, она. Что она? Дева у витрины Ходжеса Фиггиса[] в понедельник, искала одну из тех алфавитных книг, что ты собирался написать. Ты в нее так и впился взглядом. Запястье продето в плетеную петлю зонтика. Живет в Лисон-парке, на чувствах и розовых лепестках, литературная дама. Рассказывай, Стиви[]: просто уличная. Клянусь, она носит эти уродские пояса с резинками и желтые чулки, штопанные толстой шерстью. Поговори про яблочные пирожки, []. И где твой разум?Коснись меня. Мягкий взгляд. Мягкая мягкая мягкая рука. Я одинок здесь.О, коснись меня скорее, сейчас. Что это за слово, которое знают все[]? Я здесь один, я тих. Я печален. Коснись же, коснись меня.Он растянулся навзничь на острых скалах, засунув в карман карандаш и исписанный клочок, надвинув на глаза шляпу. Это в точности жест Кевина Игена, когда он устраивается вздремнуть, посубботствовать.   .   []. Алло! Бонжур, добро пожаловать, рады вам, как майским цветам[]. Под ее укрытием[], сквозь павлиньих подрагиванье ресниц, он глядел на южнеющее солнце. Тут как в раскаленной печи. Час Пана, полуденный отдых фавна.Средь соконалитых змеерастений, млекоточивых плодов, где широко раскинулись листья на бронзовоцветных водах. Боль далеко.Не прячь глаза и не скорби.Взор его поскорбел над тупоносыми башмаками, быка обносками . Он сосчитал вмятины на покоробленной коже, в которой удобно гнездилась прежде нога другого. Нога, что мерно пристукивала по земле, неприятная мне нога. Ты был, однако, в восторге, когда башмачок Эстер Освальт[] подошел тебе, знакомая девица в Париже. ,   []! Верный друг, братская душа: любовь Уайльда, та, что назвать себя не смеет[]. Теперь он бросит меня. А чья вина? Каков я есть. Каков я есть. Все или ничего[].Длинными упругими петлями струился поток из озера Кок[], зелено-золотистым заполняя песчаные лагуны, набирая силу, струясь. Этак тросточка моя уплывет. Подожду. Нет, минует, ударяясь в низкие скалы, завиваясь в воронки, минуя. Давай лучше побыстрей с этим делом. Слушай: четырехсловная речь волн  сиссс суссс пыссс фсс. Ярое дыхание вод средь морских змеев, вздыбленных коней, скал. Они плещутся в чашах скал: плеск  плям  плен: пленены в бочках. И, иссякая, речь их стихает. Они льются, журча, широко разливаясь, неся гроздья пены, распускающиеся цветы.Он видел, как под закипающим приливом извиваются водоросли[], истомлено поднимая и колебля слабо противящиеся руки, задирая подолы, в шепчущих струях колебля и простирая вверх робкие серебристые ростки. День за днем, ночь за ночью, захлестнуты  вздымаются  опадают вновь. Боже, они устали; и под шепот струй к ним, вздыхают. Святому Амвросию[] внятны были эти вздохи волн и ветвей, ждущих, жаждущих исполнения своих сроков:      []. Без цели собраны, без пользы отпущены; склонятся вперед  вернутся назад: ткацкий станок луны. Как они, истомленная, под взглядами любовников, сластолюбивых мужчин, нагая женщина, сияющая в своих чертогах, влачит она бремя вод.Там будет саженей пять. Отец твой спит на дне морском[], над ним саженей пять. В час, он сказал. Найден утопленник. Полный прилив на Дублинской отмели. Гонит перед собой наносы гальки, случайные ракушки, широкие стаи рыбы. Труп, выбеленный солью, всплывает из отката, покачивается к берегу, едет-едет сам-сам, самец. Вон он. Цепляй живо. Хотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертанья. Готово, наш. Полегче теперь.Мешок трупных газов, сочащийся зловонной жижей. Стайка мальков, отъевшихся на рыхлом лакомстве, стрелой вылетает через щели его застегнутой ширинки. Бог стал человеком человек рыбой рыба гагарой гагара перинной горой[]. Дыханьями мертвых дышу я живой, ступаю по праху мертвых, пожираю мочой пропитанную требуху от всех мертвых. Мешком переваленный через борт, он испускает смрад своей зеленой могилы, лепрозная дыра носа храпит на солнце.Морской сюрприз, соль высинила карие глаза. Морская смерть, мягчайшая из всех, ведомых человеку[]. Древний отец Океан[]. Парижский приз  остерегайтесь подделки. Рекомендуем проверить. Мы получили огромное удовольствие.Ступай. Пить хочется[]. Собираются облака. А тучи где-нибудь есть, нет? Гроза. Сверкая, он низвергается, гордая молния разума[], , ,   []. Нет.В шляпе, с посохом бреду, башмаки стучат[]. Его-мои башмаки. Куда? В закатные земли, в страну вечернюю. Вечер обретет себя.Он взял тросточку за эфес, сделал ею легкий выпад, еще в нерешительности. Да. Вечер обретет себя во мне  без меня. Все дни приходят к концу. Кстати, на той неделе, когда там во вторник самый длинный день. Несет нам радость новый год, о мать, тарам-пам-пам[].Благородному поэту Лаун-Теннисону. []. Старой желтозубой ведьме. И мсье Дрюмону, благородному журналисту. . А зубы у меня совсем плохие. Почему, интересно? Пощупай. Этот тоже шатается. Скорлупки. Надо бы, наверно, к зубному на эти деньги, а? И тот. Беззубый Клинк, сверхчеловек[]. Почему это, интересно, или, может, тут что-то кроется?Платок мой. Он забрал. Помню. А я назад не забрал?Рука тщетно пошарила в карманах. Нет, не забрал. Лучше другой купить.Он аккуратно положил сухую козявку, которую уколупнул в носу, на выступ скалы. Желающие пусть смотрят.Позади. Кажется, кто-то есть.Он обернулся через плечо, взирая назад. Пронося в воздухе высокие перекладины трех мачт, с парусами, убранными по трем крестам салингов, домой, против течения, безмолвно скользя, безмолвный корабль.Эпизод []Мистер Леопольд Блум с удовольствием ел внутренние органы животных и птиц. Он любил жирный суп из гусиных потрохов, пупки с орехами, жареное фаршированное сердце, печенку, поджаренную ломтиками в сухарях, жареные наважьи молоки. Всего же больше любил он бараньи почки на углях, которые оставляли во рту тонкий привкус с отдаленным ароматом мочи.Почки не выходили из головы у него, пока он, стараясь тихо ступать, собирал для нее завтрак на горбатом подносе. На кухне было прохладно, даже зябко, хотя за окном стояло летнее погожее утро. Это как-то еще разжигало аппетит.Уголь в очаге разгорался.Хлеб с маслом: еще ломтик  три, четыре  и хватит. Она не любит, когда гора на тарелке. Хватит. Отойдя от подноса, он снял с полки чайник и поставил на огонь сбоку. Чайник сел тусклой глыбой, выставив торчком хобот. Скоро поспеет. Хорошо. Во рту сухо.Кошка ходила на прямых лапах вокруг ножки стола, хвост кверху. Мррау! А, вот ты где,  сказал мистер Блум, оборачиваясь от очага.Кошка мяукнула в ответ и продолжала путь вокруг ножки, ступая на прямых лапах, мяукая. Вот так же она разгуливает по моему письменному столу.Мурр. Почеши за ушком. Мурр.Мистер Блум с добродушным интересом поглядел на черное гибкое существо.Ладный вид: шерстка гладкая и блестит, белая пуговка под хвостом, глаза зеленые, светятся. Он нагнулся к ней, упершись ладонями в колени. Молочка киске! Мррау!  громко мяукнула она.Говорят, они глупые. Они понимают, что мы говорим, лучше, чем мы их понимаем. Вот эта все что хочет поймет. И злопамятная. Интересно, каким я ей кажусь. Вышиной с башню? Нет, она ведь может на меня вспрыгнуть. А цыплят боится,  поддразнил он ее.  Боится цыпцыпочек. В жизни не видал такой глупой киски.Жестокая. Это у них в природе. Странно, что мыши при этом не пищат. Как будто им нравится. Мгррау!  мяукнула она громче.Глаза ее, жадные, полуприкрытые от стыда, моргнули, и, жалобно, протяжно мяукнув, она выставила свои молочно-белые зубки. Он видел, как сужаются от жадности черные щелки ее зрачков, превращая глаза в зеленые камешки. Подойдя к шкафу, он взял кувшин, свеженаполненный разносчиком от Ханлона, налил на блюдце теплопузырчатого молока и осторожно поставил блюдце на пол. Мяв!  взвизгнула она, кидаясь к еде.Он смотрел, как металлически поблескивают ее усы в тусклом свете и как, трижды примерившись, она легко принялась лакать. Правда или нет, что, если усы подрезать, не сможет охотиться. Почему бы? Может, кончики светят в темноте. Или служат как щупики, возможно.Он слушал, как она лакает. Яичницу с ветчиной не стоит. В такую сушь яйца нехорошо. Хочется свежей, чистой воды. Баранью почку у Бакли сегодня тоже не стоит: четверг. Обжарить в масле  и с перчиком. Лучше свиную почку у Длугача. Пока чайник не закипел. Она лакала все медленней, потом вылизала блюдце. Почему у них языки такие шершавые? Лакать удобней, сплошь пористые, в дырочках. Ничего она тут не слопает? Он поглядел кругом.Ничего.Тихо поскрипывая подошвами, он поднялся по лестнице в переднюю и стал у дверей спальни. Может, она захочет чего-нибудь повкусней. Обычно предпочитает небольшие бутербродики утром. Но все-таки  вдруг.Он проговорил негромко, стоя в пустой передней: Я схожу за угол. Через минуту вернусь.Услышал звуки своего голоса, добавил: Тебе чего-нибудь не захватить к завтраку?Мягкий и сонный голос пробормотал в ответ: Нне.Нет. Ничего не хочет. Затем послышался глубокий парной вздох, еще мягче, это она повернулась в постели, и разболтанные медные кольца звякнули. Надо, чтоб подтянули. Жаль. Из Гибралтара, неблизкий путь.Совсем забыла испанский, и ту малость, что знала. Интересно, сколько папаша за нее заплатил. Фасон старинный. Ах да, конечно. С губернаторского аукциона. По знакомству. По части денег старина Твиди кремень. Да, сэр.Было дело под Плевной. Я вышел из рядовых, сэр, и горжусь этим. Но все-таки хватило ума провернуть дельце с марками. Проявил дальновидность.Рука его сняла шляпу с крючка над толстым пальто с его монограммой и над ношеным плащом с распродажи забытых вещей. Марка: картинка, а сзади клей. Наверняка из офицеров многие этим промышляют. Что говорить.Пропотевшее клеймо на дне шляпы молча сообщило ему: Плестоу, шляпы-лю. Он заглянул воровато за кожаный ободок. Белая полоска бумаги. Надежное место.На крыльце он ощупал брючный карман: тут ли ключ. Нету. В тех, что оставил. Надо бы взять. Картофелина на месте[]. Гардероб скрипит. Не стоит ее тревожить. Была совсем сонная. Он притянул дверь к себе, осторожно, еще чуть-чуть, пока защитная полоска внизу не прикрыла порожек усталым веком.На вид закрыто. Обойдется до моего прихода.Он перешел на солнечную сторону, минуя открытый люк погреба в семьдесят пятом доме. Солнце приближалось к шпилю церкви святого Георгия. Похоже, день будет жаркий. Когда в этом черном, особенно чувствуешь. Черное проводит, отражает (а может, преломляет?) тепло. Но в светлом костюме никак нельзя. Не пикник. От ощущения блаженного тепла глаза его часто жмурились, фургон из пекарни Боланда лотки наш насущный но ей вчерашний больше по вкусу пироги горячая хрустящая корочка. Чувствуешь себя помолодевшим. Где-нибудь на востоке, вот таким утром, пуститься в путь на заре. Будешь двигаться впереди солнца  выиграешь у него день. А если все время так, то в принципе никогда не постареешь ни на один день. Идешь вдоль берега, в незнакомой стране, подходишь к городским воротам, там стража, тоже какой-нибудь служака с усищами старины Твиди опирается на этакую длинную пику. Бродишь по улицам под навесами. Головы прохожих в тюрбанах. Темные пещеры лавок, где торгуют коврами, внутри здоровенный турок, Свирепый турка, сидит, поджавши ноги, покуривая витой кальян. Крики разносчиков. Для питья вода с укропом, шербет. Слоняешься целый день.Можешь повстречать парочку грабителей. Ну и что, повстречаешь. Солнце к закату. Тени мечетей между колонн; мулла со свитком в руках. Дрожь по деревьям, сигнал, вечерняя свежесть. Прохожу дальше. Гаснущее золотое небо. Мать на пороге хижины. Зовет детишек домой на своем темном наречии.Из за высокой стены звуки струн. Луна в ночном небе, лиловая, как новые подвязки у Молли. Звуки струн. Слушаешь. Девушка играет на этом инструменте, как же он называется, цимбалы. Идешь дальше.А может быть, там все и не так. Начитался этой ерунды: по следам солнца[]. С сияющим солнцем на титуле. Он усмехнулся самодовольно. Как сказал Артур Гриффит про ту заставку над передовицей во Фримене: солнце гомруля восходит на северо-западе из переулка за Ирландским банком[]. Он длил усмешку. В духе еврейского остроумия: солнце гомруля восходит на северо-западе.Он приблизился к пивной Ларри ОРурка. Из-под решетки погреба плыли влажные испарения портера. Через раскрытые двери бара несло имбирем, бросовым чаем и бисквитной трухой. Но заведение стоящее: как раз у трамвайного кольца. Скажем, Маколи там подальше: гиблое место. А если бы провели линию вдоль Северной окружной, от скотного рынка к набережным, цена тут же бы подскочила.Лысая голова над занавеской. Прижимист старый пройдоха. Насчет рекламы с ним бесполезно. Что ж, в своем деле ему видней. Вон он, наш бравый Ларри, без пиджака, прислонясь к мешкам с сахаром, созерцает, как прислужник в фартуке орудует с ведром и шваброй. Саймон Дедал его отлично копирует, как он щурит свои глазенки. Знаете, я вам что скажу? Что же, мистер ОРурк? Знаете, для японцев русские  только закуска к завтраку.Стоп, надо перекинуться парой слов: может, про похороны. Бедняга Дигнам, вы уже слышали, мистер ОРурк?Сворачивая на Дорсет-стрит, он бодро окликнул в дверь: День добрый, мистер ОРурк. Добрый день, добрый день. Хорошая погодка, сэр. Ничего не скажешь.Откуда у них деньги берутся? Наезжают рыжаки-прислужники из графства Лейтрим, моют стаканы да сливают опивки в погребе. И вдруг, любуйтесь, он уже процветает, как Адам Финдлейтерс или Дэн Таллонс. А еще учесть конкуренцию. Повальная жажда. Неплохая головоломка: пересечь Дублин и не натолкнуться на кабак. Тут просто так не скопишь. Может, с пьяных имеют.Принес три, записал пять. Ну и что это? Там бобик[], тут бобик, одни крохи. А может, на оптовых заказах. Стакнется с агентом поставщиков. Ты босса своего обработай, а навар пополам, идет?Сколько он может взять за месяц на портере? Скажем, сбыл десять бочек.Скажем, он имеет десять процентов. Какие там десять. Пятнадцать. Он проходил мимо школы святого Иосифа. Галдят, сорванцы. Окна настежь. Свежий воздух помогает запоминать. И хором полезно. Эйбиси дифиджи килумен опикью эрэстэ видаблью. Это мальчишки там? Да. Иништерк. Инишарк. Инишбоффин.Зубрят свою смехографию. Мою. Горы Блум[].Он остановился перед витриной Длугача, глядя на связки колбас, копченых и кровяных, темных и светлых. Пятнадцать помножить на. Цифры, ускользая, вертелись в его мозгу: он недовольно прогнал их. Глянцевитые кольца, туго начиненные мясом, насыщали его взгляд, и он безмятежно вдыхал пряный и парной запах вареной свиной крови.Почка сочила кровь на блюдо с рисунком из ивовых ветвей: последняя. Он стоял у прилавка следом за соседской прислугой. Возьмет ее или нет? Она вычитывала по пунктам, держа в руке списочек. Руки потрескались: от стирки. И полтора фунта сосисок Денни. Взгляд его приковали мощные бедра.Вудс его фамилия. Чем занимается неизвестно. Жена уже старовата. Свежая кровь. Ухажеров не разрешают. Руки крепкие. Выбивала ковер на веревке.Серьезно выбивала, я вам скажу. Юбка сбилась на сторону, взлетала с каждым ударом.Хореглазый свинопродавец свертывал низку сосисок толстыми, розовыми, как сосиски, пальцами. Эк тугомяса, что телка откормленная в стойле.Он взял один листок из лежавшей стопки. Образцовая ферма в Киннерете, на берегу Тивериадского озера. Можно создать идеальный зимний санаторий.Мозес Монтефиоре[], я так и думал. Усадьба обнесена стеной, в смутной дымке пасущиеся стада. Он отставил от себя листок: интересно; прочесть повнимательней, пасущиеся стада в дымке, листок похрустывал. Молоденькая белая телочка. Бывало, поутру на скотном рынке[]: ревут быки, клейменые овцы в загонах, шлепается навоз, скотоводы чавкают по грязи в кованых сапогах, держа неошкуренные прутья, похлопывают скотину по мясистым задам, гляди  первый сорт. Он заставлял себя невозмутимо держать листок, обуздывая волю и чувства, устремив в точку кроткий застывший взор. Юбка сбилась, взлетала каждый раз  рраз  рраз.Свинопродавец выхватил два листа из стопки, завернул первосортные сосиски, осклабил медную рожу. Пожалте, мисс.С дерзкой ухмылкой она протянула ему монету в своей мощной руке. Благодарим, мисс. Сдача шиллинг три пенса. А вам, сэр?Мистер Блум, не мешкая, показал. Догнать и пойти за ней, если недалеко еще, следом за колыхающимися окороками. Недурно, как первая утренняя картинка. Да поживей ты, тьфу. Куй железо, пока горячо. Она вышла из лавки, постояла на ярком солнце и двинулась ленивой походкой направо. Он вздохнул, выпустив воздух через нос: они никогда не понимают. Руки огрубели от стирки. И на ногах ногти с наростами. Изодранная темная власяница защищает все подступы. Укол от ее равнодушия разгорелся в груди у него до слабого наслаждения. Не тебе, другому: какой-то констебль на досуге тискал ее на Экклс-лейн. Они любят, когда есть за что подержаться.Первосортные сосиски. Ах-ах, я заблудилась, о мистер полисмен. Три пенса, сэр.Рука его приняла влажную мякоть и опустила в боковой карман. Затем выудила из брючного кармана три монетки и положила на резиновые пупырышки.Они полежали миг, были мигом подсчитаны и мигом отправлены, одна за другой, в ящик кассы. Спасибо, сэр. Заходите.Лисьи глазки, благодаря его, метнули испытующую искорку. Мистер Блум почти сразу же отвел взгляд. Нет  лучше не стоит  в другой раз. Всего доброго,  произнес он, уходя. Всего доброго, сэр.Ни следа. Скрылась. Ну и ладно.Он зашагал обратно по Дорсет-стрит, углубившись в чтение. Агендат Нетаим[] товарищество плантаторов. Приобрести у турецкого правительства большие песчаные участки и засадить эвкалиптовыми деревьями. Дают отличную тень, топливо и строительный материал. Апельсиновые плантации и необъятные дынные бахчи к северу от Яффы. Вы платите восемьдесят марок, и для вас засаживают дунам земли маслинами, апельсинами, миндалем или лимонами.Маслины дешевле: для апельсинов нужно искусственное орошение. Ежегодно вам высылаются образцы урожая. Вас вносят в книги товарищества в качестве пожизненного владельца. Можете уплатить наличными десять, потом годичные взносы. Берлин , Бляйбтройштрассе, .Не выйдет. Но что-то есть в этом.Он видел стадо в знойной серебристой дымке. Пыльные, серебристые маслины. Долгие безмятежные дни: уход за деревьями, сбор плодов. Маслины, кажется, кладут в банки? Дома несколько осталось, от Эндрюса. Молли сперва плевалась, теперь входит во вкус. Апельсины в папиросной бумаге укладывают в ящики. Другие цитрусы так же. Цитроны. Интересно, там ли еще бедняга Цитрон, на Сент-Кевин-пэрейд. И Мастянский со своей цитрой[]. Славные у нас были вечера. Молли в плетеном кресле Цитрона. Приятно взять в руки, плод восковой, прохладный, подержишь, поднесешь к носу и вдохнешь аромат. Такой густой, сладкий, одуряющий аромат. Всегда такой же, из года в год. И по хорошей цене идут, Мойзел мне говорил. Арбьютес-плейс, Плизентс-стрит; добрые старые времена. Он говорил, нельзя ни малейшего изъяна[]. Проходят весь этот путь: Испания, Гибралтар, Средиземное море, Ближний Восток.Штабеля ящиков в Яффе на набережной, клерк их вычеркивает в гроссбухе, грузчики в замасленных робах таскают. Вон этот, какбишьего, выходит от.Как ваши де? Не смотрит. Одна скука, когда встречаешь шапочного знакомца.Спина как у того норвежского капитана[]. Интересно, еще раз встречу его сегодня? Поливалка. Накликать дождь. На небеси и на земли.Облако начало закрывать солнце: медленно, больше и больше, целиком.Серое. Вдалеке.Нет, там не так. Бесплодный, голый, пустынный край. Вулканическое озеро, мертвое море: ни рыбы, ни водорослей, глубокая впадина в земле.Ветру не всколыхнуть эти воды, свинцово-серые, с ядовитыми испарениями.Это называется дождь серный; города долины  Содом, Гоморра, Едом[]. Мертвые имена. Мертвое море в мертвой стране, седой, древней. Древней сейчас. Она кормила древнейшее, изначальное племя. Сгорбленная старуха перешла улицу у лавки Кэссиди, цепко сжимая в когтях бутылку. Древнейший народ. Скитался в дальних краях, по всей земле, из плена в плен, плодясь, умирая, рождаясь повсюду. Земля же его лежит там. И больше не может уже родить. Мертва  старушиная  седая запавшая пизда планеты.Запустение.Седой ужас опалил его плоть. Сложив листок, сунув его в карман, он повернул на Экклс-стрит, торопясь домой. Холодная маслянистость ползла по его жилам, леденя кровь; годы одевали его в соляной покров. Что же, такие мои дела. Ранняя рань, а на уме дрянь. Не с той ноги встал. Надо снова начать упражнения по Сэндоу[]. Стойку на руках. Кирпичные бурые дома в пежинах. Восьмидесятый так и пустует. Почему бы? Всего двадцать восемь фунтов по оценке. Тауэрс, Баттерсби, Норт, Макартур: все окна первого этажа в билетиках. Нашлепки на больном глазу. Вдохнуть теплый парок от чайника, дымок от масла на сковородке. Подойти поближе к ней, полнотелой, в теплой постели. Да, да.Стремительные жаркие лучи солнца примчались от Беркли-роуд, проворные, в легких сандалиях, по просиявшему тротуару. Вон она, вон она стремится навстречу мне, девушка с золотыми волосами по ветру.Открытка и два письма на полу в прихожей. Он, наклонившись, поднял.Миссис Мэрион Блум[]. Стремительный ритм сердца резко упал. Дерзкий почерк.Миссис Мэрион. Польди!Войдя в спальню, он полуприкрыл глаза и, двигаясь сквозь теплый и желтый сумрак, приблизился к ее растрепанной голове. Кому там письма?Он поглядел на них. Моллингар. Милли. Письмо мне от Милли,  сказал он, следя за своим голосом,  а тебе открытка. И письмо тебе.Он положил ее письмо и открытку на саржевое покрывало у сгиба ее колен. Тебе шторы поднять?Подтягивая осторожно шторы до половины, он видел через плечо, как она глянула на конверт и сунула его под подушку. Хватит так?  спросил он, оборачиваясь.Она читала открытку, приподнявшись на локте. Посылка дошла уже,  сказала она.Он не уходил; она отложила открытку и медленно, с блаженным вздохом, опять свернулась клубком. Давай-ка чай поскорей,  поторопила она.  Совсем горло пересохло. Чайник уже кипит.Однако он задержался убрать со стула: полосатая нижняя юбка, нечистое мятое белье; и, взяв все в охапку, положил в ноги постели.Когда он был уже на ступеньках, она окликнула: Польди! Что? Ошпарь заварной чайник.Вполне закипел: пар валит из носика. Он ошпарил и сполоснул заварной чайник, насыпал четыре полных ложечки чаю и, наклонив большой чайник, залил чай водой. Поставив чай настояться, он отодвинул большой чайник в сторону и, вдавив сковороду прямо в жар угля, смотрел, как масло плавится и скользит по ней. Когда он развернул почку, кошка жадно мяукнула рядом с ним. Если ей давать много мяса, не будет мышей ловить. Говорят, они не едят свинину. Кошер. Он бросил ей окровавленную обертку и положил почку в шипящее масло. Перцу. Он взял щепотку из выщербленной рюмки для яйца, посыпал круговыми движениями.Потом он распечатал письмо, скользнул глазами по всей странице. Спасибо  новая беретка  мистер Коклан  пикник на озере Оул  студент  приморские красотки Буяна Бойлана[].Чай настоялся. Улыбаясь, он налил себе в свою чашку, имитация фарфора Кроун-Дерби, с приспособлением для усов. Подарок Милли-глупышки ко дню рождения. Тогда ей было всего пять лет. Нет, погоди: четыре. Принес ей бусики под янтарь, она тут же порвала. Опускал для нее в почтовый ящик сложенные листочки. Он улыбался, наливая чай.О Милли Блум, ты мне мила, моя родная,В тебя, как в зеркало, гляжусь, тебя желая.Хоть ты бедна, хочу я быть с тобою рядом,А не с той Кэти, что виляет толстым задом[].Бедный старый профессор Гудвин. Конечно, слегка ку-ку. Но до того учтивый старичок. Провожал Молли с эстрады на старомодный манер. А это зеркальце в цилиндре. В тот вечер Милли его притащила в гостиную. Ой, поглядите, чего было в шляпе у профессора Гудвина! Мы все смеялись.Женская натура уже тогда проявлялась. Такая была вострушка.Он поддел почку вилкой, перевернул, потом поставил заварной чайник на поднос. Горб стал пружинить, когда он поднял поднос. Все взял? Бутерброды  четыре, сахар, ложечка, сливки. Так. Он направился с подносом наверх, продев большой палец в ручку чайника.Толкнув дверь коленом, он вошел и поставил поднос на стул у изголовья постели. До чего же ты долго,  сказала она.Медь задребезжала, когда она проворно приподнялась, упершись локтем в подушку. Он спокойно смотрел на ее полные формы и на ложбинку между мягких больших грудей, круглившихся в ночной рубашке, как козье вымя. Тепло, шедшее от ее тела, мешалось в воздухе с душистым запахом наливаемого чая.Краешек распечатанного конверта торчал из-под примятой подушки. Уже уходя, он остановился поправить покрывало. А от кого письмо?  спросил он.Дерзкий почерк. Мэрион. Да от Бойлана,  сказала она.  Должен программу принести. Что ты собираешься петь?   [] с Дойлом[],  ответила она,  и Старую сладкую песню любви[].Она пила чай, полные губы улыбались. Довольно затхлый дух от этих курений на другой день. Как тухлая вода от цветов. Может быть, приоткрыть окошко?Отправляя в рот сложенный пополам тонкий ломтик, она спросила: А во сколько похороны? В одиннадцать, кажется,  ответил он.  Я еще не смотрел газету.Следуя знаку ее пальца, он поднял за штанину ее грязные панталоны. Не то? Тогда серую перекрученную подвязку с чулком: подошва мятая, залоснилась. Да нет же, книжку.Другой чулок. Нижняя юбка. Должно быть, упала,  сказала она.Он поглядел по сторонам.    []. Интересно, правильно ли она произносит . На кровати нигде.Завалилась куда-то. Он нагнулся и приподнял подзор. Упавшая книга распласталась на пузе ночного горшка в оранжевую полоску. Дай-ка мне,  сказала она.  Я тут отметила. Хотела одно слово спросить.Сделав глоток из чашки, которую держала за неручку, и обтерев бесцеремонно пальцы об одеяло, она принялась водить по странице шпилькой, покуда не нашла слово. Метим что?  переспросил он. Вот это,  сказала она.  Что это значит?Наклонившись, он прочел подле холеного ногтя на ее большом пальце. Метемпсихоз? Вот-вот. С чем это вообще едят? Метемпсихоз,  начал он, морща лоб,  это греческое. Из греческого языка. Это означает переселение душ. Ну и дичь!  оценила она.  А теперь скажи по-простому.Он улыбнулся, искоса глянув в ее смеющиеся глаза. Все те же молодые глаза. Первый вечер после игры в шарады. Долфинс-барн. Он полистал замусоленные страницы. Руби  краса арены. Ага, картинка. Свирепый итальянец с хлыстом. А это видно Руби краса чего там положено голая на полу. Милостиво дали прикрыться. Злодей Маффей остановился и с проклятиями отшвырнул прочь свою жертву. Всюду жестокость. Одурманенные звери. Трапеция в цирке Хенглера. Не мог смотреть, отвернулся. А толпа глазеет. Ты там надрывай силы а мы животики себе надорвем. Их целые семьи.Вдалбливают им смолоду, они и метемпсихозят. Будто бы мы живем после смерти. Души наши. Будто душа человека, когда он умрет. Дигнама вот душа Ты ее уже кончила?  спросил он. Да,  сказала она.  Совсем никакой клубнички. Она что, все время любила того, первого? Я даже не заглядывал. Хочешь другую? Ага. Принеси еще Поль де Кока[]. Такое симпатичное имя[].Она подлила себе чаю, глядя сбоку на струйку.Надо продлить ту книжку из библиотеки на Кейпл-стрит, а то напишут Карни, моему поручителю. Перевоплощение: вот то самое слово. Некоторые верят,  начал он,  что после смерти мы будем снова жить в другом теле и что уже жили раньше. Это называется перевоплощение. Что все мы уже жили раньше, тысячи лет назад, на земле или на какой-нибудь другой планете. Они считают, мы забыли про это. А некоторые говорят, будто помнят свои прошлые жизни.Густые сливки вились витками у нее в чашке. Как бы ей лучше запомнить это слово: метемпсихоз. Хорошо бы пример. Пример.Над кроватью Купанье нимфы. Приложение к пасхальному номеру Фотокартинок: роскошный шедевр, великолепные краски. Как чай до того как налили молока. Похожа на нее с распущенными волосами, только потоньше. За рамку отдано три и шесть. Она сказала: над кроватью будет красиво.Обнаженные нимфы  Греция  а вот и пример  все люди, что тогда жили.Он перелистал страницы обратно. Метемпсихоз,  сказал он,  так это называли древние греки. Они верили, что человек может превратиться в животное или, скажем, в дерево.Что они называли нимфами, например.Она перестала вдруг помешивать ложечкой. Смотрела прямо перед собой и втягивала воздух округлившимися ноздрями. Горелым пахнет,  сказала она.  У тебя там ничего на огне? Почка!  возопил он.Он сунул не глядя книжку во внутренний карман и, стукнувшись носком ноги о хромой комод, ринулся на запах, сбегая по лестнице прыжками всполошенного аиста. Пахучий дым поднимался сердитой струйкой с одного края сковороды. Поддев почку вилкой, он отодрал ее и перевернул, как на спину черепаху. Совсем чуть-чуть подгорела. Он перебросил ее на тарелку и полил оставшимся бурым соком.Теперь чайку. Он уселся, отрезал ломоть хлеба, намазал маслом. Срезал пригорелую мякоть и бросил кошке. Наконец, отправил кусочек на вилке в рот и принялся жевать, разборчиво смакуя упругое аппетитное мясо. В самый раз.Глоток чаю. Потом он нарезал хлеб на кубики, обмакнул один в соус и сунул в рот. Так что там у нее про студента и про пикник? Он разложил около себя листок с письмом и медленно стал читать, жуя, макая кубики в соус и отправляя их в рот.Дражайший папулька,Преогромнейшее спасибо за твой чудный подарочек ко дню рождения. Он мне дивно идет. Все говорят, что в новой беретке я просто неотразима. Получила от мамочки чудную коробку со сливочными тянучками, пишу ей отдельно.Конфетки  дивные. А я тут зарылась с головой в фотографию. Мистер Коклан снял меня вместе со своей мадам, когда проявим, пришлю. Вчера тут была сплошная запарка. Погожий денек, и все толстомясые припожаловали. В понедельник хотим устроить пикничок небольшой компанией на озере Оул.Спасибо тебе еще раз и тысяча поцелуев, а мамочке скажи, я ее ужасно люблю. Внизу играют на пианино. В субботу будет концерт в отеле Гревильский герб. Сюда по вечерам иногда заходит один студент, его фамилия Баннон, и у него какие-то родственники ужасные богачи, и он исполняет эту песенку Бойлана (чуть-чуть не написала Буяна Бойлана) о приморских красотках. Передай ему от меня, что Милли-глупышка ему шлет привет. Пора кончать письмо, с любовьютвоя любящая дочь, Милли... Извини за каракули, очень спешу. Пока. М.Пятнадцать вчера. Как сошлось, и число пятнадцатое. Первый день рождения в чужих местах. Разлука. Помню летнее утро, когда она родилась.Помчался за миссис Торнтон на Дензилл-стрит. Бодрая старушка. Куче младенцев помогла явиться на свет. Она с первой минуты знала: бедняжке Руди не жить. Авось Бог милостив, сэр. А сама уже знала. Остался бы жить, сейчас было бы одиннадцать.Отсутствующим печальным взглядом он смотрел на постскриптум. Извини за каракули. Спешу. Внизу пианино. Выпорхнула из гнезда. Сцена с ней из-за браслета в кафе . Не стала есть пирожные, не глядела, не разговаривала. Дерзкая девчонка. Он обмакнул в соус еще кубик хлеба, машинально продолжая доедать почку. Двенадцать и шесть в неделю. Не густо.Но могло и похуже быть. Мюзик-холл, скажем. Студент. Он глотнул остывшего чаю, запить еду Потом опять перечел письмо: дважды.Ну ладно, она умеет вести себя осмотрительно. А вдруг нет? Оставь, ничего еще не случилось. Все возможно, конечно. Во всяком случае, обождем.Бесенок. Вечно бегом по лестнице, ножки тонкие, стройные. Судьба.Наступает зрелость. Кокетка  страшная.Он улыбнулся в кухонное окно с теплотой, с тревогой. Однажды вижу ее на улице: щиплет себя за щеки, чтоб разрумянились. Слегка малокровная. Поздно отняли от груди. В тот день на Короле Эрина[] вокруг маяка Киш. Старую посудину качало вовсю. А ей хоть бы что. Шарф по ветру, светло-голубой, распущенные волосы по ветру.Щечки в ямочках, кудряшкиВскружат голову бедняжке.Приморские красотки. Распечатанный конверт. Руки в брюки и распевает, ни дать ни взять извозчик навеселе. Друг дома. Вскрюжат , он так поет.Освещенный пирс, летний вечер, звуки оркестра.До чего ж милы и кроткиТе приморские красотки.И Милли тоже. Первые юные поцелуи. Как давно минуло. Миссис Мэрион.Сейчас снова легла, читает, перебирая прядки волос, заплетая их, улыбаясь.Сожаление и потерянность, нарастая, смутной волной расползались вниз по спине. Да, случится. Помешать. Бесполезно: что сделаешь! Девичьи губы, нежные, легкие. Случится то же. Он чувствовал, как волна потерянности охватывает его. Бесполезно тут что-то делать. Губы целуют, целующие, целуемые. Женские губы, полные, клейкие.Лучше пусть там, где она сейчас: подальше. И занята. Хотела собаку от нечего делать. Можно бы туда съездить. На табельные дни в августе, всего два и шесть в оба конца. Но это через полтора месяца. Можно бы устроить бесплатный проезд, как журналисту. Или через Маккоя.Кошка, вылизав свою шерстку, вернулась к обертке в кровяных пятнах, потыкала ее носом и пошла к двери. Оглянулась на него, мяукнула. Хочет выйти. Жди перед дверью  когда-нибудь отворится. Пусть подождет. Как-то занервничала. Электричество. Гроза в воздухе. И умывала ушко спиной к огню.Он ощутил сытую тяжесть  потом легкие позывы в желудке. Поднялся из-за стола, распуская брючный ремень. Кошка настойчиво мяукнула. Мяу,  передразнил он.  Обождешь, пока я сам соберусь.Тяжесть: день будет жаркий. Лень подыматься на площадку по лестнице.Газетку. В сортире он любил читать. Надеюсь, никакая макака туда не забредет, пока я.В ящике стола ему попался старый номер Осколков. Свернув, он сунул его под мышку, подошел к двери и отворил. Кошка кинулась мягкими прыжками наверх. А, вон ты куда  свернуться на постели клубком.Прислушавшись, он услыхал ее голос: Поди сюда, кисонька. Ну поди.Он вышел с черного хода во двор; постоял, прислушиваясь к звукам соседнего двора. Все тихо. Может быть, вешают белье. Королевна в парке[] вешает белье. Славное утро.Он наклонился взглянуть на чахлые кустики мяты, посаженной вдоль стены.Поставить беседку здесь. Бобы, дикий виноград. И надо везде удобрить, земля плохая. Бурая корка серы. Почва всегда такая без навоза. Кухонные помои. Перегной  что бы это за штука? У соседей куры: вот их помет  отличное удобрение. Но самое лучшее от скота, особенно если кормили жмыхами. Сухой навоз. Лучшее средство для чистки лайковых перчаток. Грязь очищает. И зола. Надо тут все переделать. В том углу горох. Салат. Всегда будет свежая зелень. Но с этими садиками свои неудобства. Тот шмель или овод в Духов день.Он двинулся по дорожке. А где моя шляпа, кстати? Должно быть, повесил обратно на крючок. Или оставил наверху. Вот номер, совсем не помню. На вешалке в прихожей слишком полно. Четыре зонтика, ее плащ. Подбирал письма. У Дрейго колокольчик звонил. Как странно, именно в этот момент я думал. Его волосы, каштановые, напомаженные, над воротничком. Свежевымыт и свежепричесан. Не знаю, успею ли зайти в баню. Тара-стрит. Тип, что у них за кассой, устроил побег Джеймсу Стивенсу[]. Такие слухи. ОБрайен.Каким он басом говорит, этот Длугач. Агенда  как там? Пожалте, мисс.Энтузиаст.Он отворил, толкнув носком, ветхую дверь сортира. Смотри, чтобы не запачкать брюки, потом на похороны. Вошел, пригнув голову, стараясь не задеть о низкий косяк. Оставив дверь приоткрытой, посреди пыльной паутины и вони заплесневелой хлорки, не спеша, отстегнул подтяжки. Перед тем как усесться, бросил через щель взгляд на соседское окно. А король на троне пишет манифест. Никого нет.Раскорячившись на позорном стуле, он развернул журнал на оголенных коленях и стал читать. Что-нибудь новенькое и полегче. Не торопись особо.Попридержи. Наш премированный осколок: Мастерский удар Мэтчена. Автор  мистер Филип Бьюфой, член лондонского Клуба театралов. Гонорар по гинее за столбец. Три с половиной. Три фунта три. Три фунта тринадцать и шесть.Он мирно прочел, сдерживая себя, первый столбец, затем, уступая, но еще придерживая, начал второй. На середине, окончательно уступив, он дал кишечнику опорожниться свободно, продолжая мирно, неторопливо читать, вчерашний легкий запор прошел без следа. Авось не слишком толсто, геморрой снова не разойдется. Нет, самый раз. Ага. Уфф! Для страдающих запором: одна таблетка святой коры. В жизни может такое быть. Это не тронуло и не взволновало его, но, в общем, было бойко и живо. Теперь что хочешь печатают. На безрыбье. Он читал дальше, спокойно сидя над своими подымавшимися миазмами. Бойко, что говорить. Мэтчен часто вспоминает свой мастерский удар, покоривший сердце смеющейся чаровницы, которая ныне.Мораль в конце и в начале. Рука об руку[]. Лихо. Он снова окинул взглядом прочитанное и, выпуская ровную заключительную струю, благодушно позавидовал мистеру Бьюфою, который сочинил это и получил гонорар в размере трех фунтов тринадцати шиллингов и шести пенсов.Я б тоже мог кое-что накропать. Авторы  мистер и миссис Л.М.Блум.Придумать историйку на тему пословицы. Какой только? Как-то пробовал записывать на манжете, что она говорит, пока собирается. Не люблю собираться вместе. Порезался, бреясь. Покусывает нижнюю губку, застегивая крючки на платье. Я засекаю время. :. Робертс тебе заплатил уже? :. А в чем была Грета Конрой[]? :. Чего меня угораздило купить такую гребенку? :. С этой капусты меня всегда пучит. Заметит пылинки на обуви  потрет каждую туфельку об чулки на икрах, обе по очереди, так ловко.Наутро после благотворительного бала, когда оркестр Мэя исполнял танец часов Понкьелли[]. Объяснял ей: утренние часы, потом день, вечер, потом ночные часы. Она чистила зубы. Это была первая встреча. У нее голова кружилась. Пощелкивали пластинки веера. А этот Бойлан богатый? Да, он со средствами. А что? Я во время танца заметила, у него пахнет чем-то приятным изо рта. Тогда не стоит мурлыкать. Надо бы намекнуть. В последний раз какая-то странная музыка. Зеркало было в темноте. Она взяла свое маленькое, потерла о кофточку на грудях, нервно, так и заколыхались. Потом смотрелась. Нахмуренный взгляд. Чего-то там такое не сладилось.Вечерние часы, девушки в серых газовых платьях. Потом ночные часы в черном, с кинжалами, в полумасках. Это поэтично, розовое, потом золотое, потом серое, потом черное. И в то же время как в жизни. День, потом ночь.Он смело оторвал половину премированного рассказа и подтерся ею. Потом поднял брюки, застегнул, надел подтяжки. Потянул на себя кривую шаткую дверь сортира и вышел из полумрака на воздух.При ярком свете, облегченный и освеженный в членах, он тщательно осмотрел свои черные брюки, их обшлага, колени и за коленями. Во сколько похороны? Надо уточнить по газете.Мрачные скрипучие звуки высоко в воздухе. Колокола церкви святого Георгия. Они отбивали время: гулкий мрачный металл.Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Эй  гей! Эй  гей!Без четверти. Потом снова: по воздуху донесся обертон, терция.Бедный Дигнам!Эпизод []По набережной сэра Джона Роджерсона шагал собранным шагом мистер Блум: мимо ломовых подвод, мимо маслобойни Лиска (льняное масло, жмыхи), мимо Уиндмилл-лейн и мимо почтово-телеграфного отделения. На этот адрес тоже было бы можно. И мимо богадельни для моряков. С шумливой утренней набережной он повернул на Лайм-стрит. У коттеджей Брэди шатался мальчишка-свалочник, примкнув ведерко с требухой, сосал жеваный окурок.Девчонка помладше, с изъеденным коростой лбом, глазела на него, вяло придерживая ржавый обруч. Сказать ему, если курит  перестанет расти. Да ладно, оставь в покое! И так житье у него не рай. Ждать у трактира, тащить папашу домой. Тять, ну пойдем, мамка ждет. Как раз затишье: не будет много народу. Он перешел Таунсенд-стрит, миновал хмурый фасад Бетеля[]. Да, Эль.Его дом: Алеф, Бет. Потом похоронное бюро Николса. В одиннадцать. Времени хватит. Ей-ей, Корни Келлехер подкинул эту работенку ОНилу. Напевает, прикрыв глаза. Корни. Повстречал я в темном парке. Одну пташку. Возле арки. Работает на полицию. Свое имя мне сказала и мои труляля труляля там там. Ясное дело, он подкинул. Схороните-ка по дешевке в сухом-немазаном. И мои труляля труляля труляля труляля.На Уэстленд-роу он остановился перед витриной Белфастской и Восточной чайной компании, прочел ярлыки на пачках в свинцовой фольге: отборная смесь, высшее качество, семейный чай. Жарко становится. Чай. Надо бы им разжиться у Тома Кернана[]. Хотя похороны  неподходящий случай. Покуда глаза его невозмутимо читали, он снял не торопясь шляпу, вдохнув запах своего брильянтина, и плавным неторопливым жестом провел правой рукой по лбу и по волосам. Какое жаркое утро. Глаза из-под приспущенных век отыскали чуть заметную выпуклость на кожаном ободке внутри его шляпы-лю.Вот она. Правая рука погрузилась в тулью. Пальцы живо нащупали за ободком карточку, переместили в карман жилета.До того жарко. Правая рука еще раз еще неторопливей поднялась и прошлась: отборная смесь, из лучших цейлонских сортов. На дальнем востоке.Должно быть, чудесный уголок: сад мира[], огромные ленивые листья, на них можно плавать, кактусы, лужайки в цветах, деревья-змеи, как их называют.Интересно, там вправду так? Сингалезы валяются на солнышке, в   [], за целый день пальцем не шевельнут.Шесть месяцев в году спят. Слишком жарко для ссор. Влияние климата.Летаргия. Цветы праздности[]. Главная пища  воздух. Азот. Теплицы в Ботаническом саду. Хрупкие растения, водяные лилии. Листья истомились без.Сонная болезнь в воздухе. Ходишь по розовым лепесткам. Навернуть рубцов, студню, это и в голову не взбредет. Тот малый на картинке, в каком же он месте был? Ах да, на мертвом море, лежит себе на спине, читает газету под зонтиком. При всем желании не утонешь: столько там соли. Потому что вес воды, нет, вес тела в воде равен весу, весу чего же? Или объем равен весу?Какой то закон такой, Вэнс нас учил в школе. Вечно крутил пальцами. Учение и кручение. А что это, в самом деле, вес? Тридцать два фута в секунду за секунду. Закон падения тел: в секунду за секунду. Все они падают на землю.Земля. Сила земного тяготения, вот это что такое, вес.Он повернулся и неспешно перешел через улицу. Как это она вышагивала с сосисками? Примерно так вот. На ходу он вынул из бокового кармана сложенный Фримен, развернул его, скатал в трубку по длине и начал похлопывать себя по брюкам при каждом неспешном шаге. Беззаботный вид: заглянул просто так. В секунду за секунду. Это значит в секунду на каждую секунду. С тротуара он метнул цепкий взгляд в двери почты. Ящик для опоздавших писем. Опускать сюда. Никого. Пошел.Он протянул свою карточку через медную решетку. Нет ли для меня писем?  спросил он.Пока почтовая барышня смотрела в ячейке, он разглядывал плакат вербовочной службы: солдаты всех родов войск на параде; и, держа конец своей трубки у самых ноздрей, вдыхал запах свежей типографской краски.Нет, наверно, ответа. В последний раз зашел слишком далеко.Барышня сквозь решетку подала ему карточку и письмо. Он поблагодарил, бросив быстрый взгляд на конверт, заадресованный на машинке:ЗдесьПочтовое Отделение Уэстленд-роу, до востребованияГенри Флауэру[], эсквайру.Ответила все-таки. Сунув письмо и карточку в боковой карман, он вернулся к параду всех родов войск. А где тут полк старины Твиди?Отставной вояка. Вон они: медвежьи шапки с султаном. Нет, он же гренадер.Остроконечные обшлага. Вот: королевские дублинские стрелки. Красные мундиры. Эффектно. Потому женщины за ними и бегают. Военная форма. Легче и вербовать и муштровать. Письмо Мод Гонн[], чтобы их не пускали по вечерам на ОКоннелл-стрит: позор для столицы Ирландии. Сейчас газета Гриффита трубит о том же[]: армия, где кишат венерические болезни, империя Венерия. Какой-то вид у них недоделанный: как будто одурманенные. Смирно. Равняйсь. Сено-солома. Сено  солома. Полк Его Величества. А вот форму пожарника или полисмена он никогда не наденет[]. Масон, да.Беспечной походкой он вышел с почты и повернул направо. Говорильня; как будто этим что-то исправишь. Рука его опустилась в карман; указательный палец просунулся под клапан конверта и вскрыл его несколькими рывками. Не думаю, чтобы женщины особо обращали внимание. Пальцы вытащили письмо и скомкали в кармане конверт. Что-то подколото: наверно, фотография. Прядь волос? Нет.Маккой. Как бы поскорей отвязаться. Одна помеха. Чужое присутствие только злит, когда ты. Здравствуйте, Блум. Куда направляетесь? Здравствуйте, Маккой. Да так, никуда. Как самочувствие? Прекрасно. А вы как? Скрипим помаленьку,  сказал Маккой.Бросая взгляд на черный костюм и галстук, он спросил, почтительно понизив голос: А что-нибудь надеюсь, ничего не случилось? Я вижу, вы Нет-нет,  сказал Блум.  Это Дигнам, бедняга. Сегодня похороны. Ах да, верно. Печальная история. А в котором часу?Нет, и не фотография. Какой-то значок, что ли. В оди одиннадцать,  ответил мистер Блум. Я попытаюсь выбраться,  сказал Маккой.  В одиннадцать, вы говорите? Я узнал только вчера вечером. Кто же мне сказал? А, Холохан[]. Прыгунчик, знаете? Знаю.Мистер Блум смотрел через улицу на кэб, стоявший у подъезда отеля Гровнор. Швейцар поставил чемодан между сиденьями. Она спокойно стояла в ожидании, а мужчина, муж, брат, похож на нее, искал мелочь в карманах.Пальто модного фасона, с круглым воротником, слишком теплое для такой погоды, на вид как байка. Стоит в небрежной позе, руки в карманы, накладные, сейчас так носят. Как та надменная дамочка на игре в поло. Все женщины свысока, пока не раскусишь. Красив телом красив и делом.Неприступны до первого приступа. Достойная госпожа и Брут весьма достойный человек[]. Разок ее поимеешь, спеси как не бывало. Я был с Бобом Дореном[], он снова сейчас в загуле, и с этим, как же его, с Бэнтамом Лайонсом[]. Да мы тут рядом и были, у Конвея.Дорен Лайонс у Конвея. Она поднесла к волосам руку в перчатке. И тут заходит Прыгунчик. Под мухой. Немного откинув голову и глядя вдаль из-под приспущенных век, он видел заплетенные крендельки, видел, как сверкает на солнце ярко-желтая кожа. Как ясно сегодня видно. Может быть, из-за влажности. Болтает о том о сем. Ручка леди. С какой стороны она будет садиться? И говорит: Грустная весть насчет бедного нашего друга Падди! Какого Падди? Это я говорю. Бедняжечки Падди Дигнама , это он говорит.За город едут  наверно, через Бродстоун. Высокие коричневые ботинки, кончики шнурков свисают. Изящная ножка. Чего он все возится с этой мелочью? А она видит, что я смотрю. Всегда примечают, если кто клюнул. На всякий случай. Запас беды не чинит. А что такое? я говорю. Чего это с ним стряслось? говорю.Надменная  богатая  чулки шелковые. Ага,  сказал мистер Блум.Он отодвинулся слегка вбок от говорящей Маккоевой головы. Будет сейчас садиться. Чего стряслось? говорит. Помер он, вот чего . И, мать честная, тут же наливает себе. Как, Падди Дигнам ? Это я говорю. Я просто ушам своим не поверил. Я же с ним был еще в прошлую пятницу, нет, в четверг, в Радуге мы сидели. Да , говорит. Покинул он нас. Скончался в понедельник, сердяга .Гляди! Гляди! Шелк сверкнул, чулки дорогие белые. Гляди!Неуклюжий трамвай, трезвоня в звонок, вклинился, заслонил.Пропало. Чтоб сам ты пропал, курносая рожа. Чувство как будто выставили за дверь. Рай и пери[]. Вот всегда так. В самый момент. Девица в подворотне на Юстейс-стрит. Кажется, в понедельник было, поправляла подвязку. Рядом подружка, прикрывала спектакль.   []. Ну что, что вылупился? Да-да,  промолвил мистер Блум с тяжким вздохом.  Еще один нас покинул. Один из лучших,  сказал Маккой.Трамвай проехал. Они уже катили в сторону Окружного моста, ручка ее в дорогой перчатке на стальном поручне. Сверк-блеск  поблескивала на солнце эгретка на ее шляпе  блеск-сверк. Супруга жива-здорова, надеюсь?  спросил Маккой, сменив тон. О да,  отвечал мистер Блум,  спасибо, все в лучшем виде.Он рассеянно развернул газетную трубку и рассеянно прочитал:Как живется в доме Без паштетов Сливи?Тоскливо.А с ними жизнь словно рай. Моя дражайшая как раз получила ангажемент. То есть, уже почти.Опять насчет чемодана закидывает[]. И что, пусть. Меня больше не проведешь.Мистер Блум приветливо и неторопливо обратил на него свои глаза с тяжелыми веками. Моя жена тоже,  сказал он.  Она должна петь в каком-то сверхшикарном концерте в Белфасте, в Ольстер-холле, двадцать пятого. Вот как?  сказал Маккой.  Рад это слышать, старина. А кто это все устраивает?Миссис Мэрион Блум. Еще не вставала. Королева в спальне хлеб с вареньем. Не за книгой. Замусоленные карты, одни картинки, разложены по семеркам вдоль бедра. На темную даму и светлого короля. Кошка пушистым черным клубком. Полоска распечатанного конверта.Эта стараяСладкаяПесняЛюбвиРаз да-ется Видите ли, это нечто вроде турне,  задумчиво сказал мистер Блум.  Песня любви . Образован комитет, при равном участии в прибылях и расходах.Маккой кивнул, пощипывая жесткую поросль усиков. Понятно,  произнес он.  Это приятная новость.Он собрался идти. Что же, рад был увидеть вас в добром здравии,  сказал он.  Встретимся как-нибудь. Конечно,  сказал мистер Блум. Знаете еще что,  решился Маккой.  Вы не могли бы меня вписать в список присутствующих на похоронах? Я бы хотел быть сам, только, возможно, не получится. В Сэндикоуве кто-то утонул, и может так выйти, что мне со следователем придется туда поехать, если тело найдут. А вы просто вставьте мое имя, если меня не будет, хорошо? Я это сделаю,  сказал мистер Блум, собираясь двигаться.  Все будет в порядке. Отлично,  сказал бодро Маккой.  Большое спасибо, старина. Может, я еще и приду. Ну, пока. Просто Ч.П. Маккой, и сойдет. Будет исполнено,  твердо пообещал мистер Блум.Не вышло меня обойти. А подбивал клинья. На простачка. Но я себе на уме. К этому чемодану у меня своя слабость. Кожа. Наугольники, клепаные края, замок с предохранителем и двойной защелкой. В прошлом году Боб Каули ему одолжил свой, для концерта на регате в Уиклоу, и с тех пор о чемоданчике ни слуху ни духу.С усмешкою на лице мистер Блум неспешно шагал в сторону Брансвик-стрит.Моя дражайшая как раз получила. Писклявое сопрано в веснушках. Нос огрызком. Не без приятности, в своем роде: для небольшого романса. Но жидковато. Вы да я, мы с вами, не правда ли? Как бы на равных. Подлиза.Противно делается. Что он, не слышит разницы? Кажется, он слегка таков. Не по мне это. Я так и думал, Белфаст его заденет. Надеюсь, в тех краях с оспой не стало хуже. А то вдруг откажется еще раз делать прививку. Ваша жена и моя жена.Интересно, а он за мной не следит?Мистер Блум стоял на углу, глаза его блуждали по красочным рекламным плакатам. Имбирный эль (ароматизированный), фирма Кантрелл и Кокрейн.Летняя распродажа у Клери. Нет, пошел прямо. Всех благ. Сегодня Лия[]: миссис Бэндмен Палмер[]. Хотелось бы еще раз посмотреть ее в этой роли.Вчера играла в Гамлете. Мужская роль. А может, он был женщина[]. Почему Офелия и покончила с собой. Бедный папа! Так часто рассказывал про Кейт Бейтмен[] в этой роли! Простоял целый день у театра Адельфи в Лондоне, чтобы попасть. Это за год до моего рождения: в шестьдесят пятом. А в Вене Ристори[]. Как же она правильно называется? Пьеса Мозенталя. Рахиль[]? Нет.Всегда говорил про ту сцену, где старый ослепший Авраам узнает голос и ощупывает его лицо пальцами. Голос Натана! Голос сына его! Я слышу голос Натана, который оставил отца своего умирать от горя и нищеты на моих руках, и оставил дом отчий, и оставил Бога отцов своих.Здесь каждое слово, Леопольд, полно глубокого смысла.Бедный папа! Бедный! Хорошо, что я не пошел в комнату и не видел его лицо. В тот день! Боже! Боже! Эх! Кто знает, быть может, так было лучше для него.Мистер Блум завернул за угол, прошел мимо понурых одров на извозчичьей стоянке. Что толку об этом думать. Пора для торбы с овсом. Лучше бы я не встретил его, этого Маккоя.Он подошел ближе, услышал хруст золоченого овса, жующие мирно челюсти.Их выпуклые оленьи глаза смотрели на него, когда он шел мимо, среди сладковатой овсяной вони лошадиной мочи. Их Эльдорадо. Бедные саврасы!Плевать им на все, уткнули длинные морды в свои торбы, знать ничего не знают и забот никаких. Слишком сыты, чтоб разговаривать. И корм и кров обеспечены. Холощеные: черный обрубок болтается, как резиновый, между ляжками. Что ж, может, они и так счастливы. На вид славная, смирная животинка. Но как примутся ржать, это бывает невыносимо.Он вынул из кармана письмо и положил в газету, которую нес. Можно здесь натолкнуться на нее. В переулке надежней.Он миновал Приют извозчика. Странная у извозчика жизнь, туда-сюда, в любую погоду, в любое место, на время или в один конец, все не по своей воле.   . Люблю иногда их угостить сигареткой. Общительны. Катит мимо, покрикивает на лету. Он замурлыкал:    Ла ла дала ла ла.Он повернул на Камберленд-стрит и, пройдя несколько шагов, остановился под стеной станции. Никого. Лесосклад Мида. Кучи досок. Развалины и хибарки. Осторожно пересек клетки классиков, в одной  позабытый камушек.Не сгорел. Возле склада мальчик на корточках играл один в шарики, посылая главный щелчком большого пальца. Пестрая и мудрая кошка, моргающий сфинкс, смотрела со своей нагретой приступки. Жалко их беспокоить. Магомет отрезал кусок своего плаща, чтобы не разбудить[]. Вынимай. Я тоже играл в шарики, когда ходил в школу к той старой даме. Она любила резеду. Миссис Эллис. А мистер где? Он развернул письмо под прикрытием газеты.Цветок. Кажется, это  Желтый цветочек с расплющенными лепестками.Значит, не рассердилась? Чего она там пишет?Дорогой Генри!Я получила твое письмо, очень тебе благодарна за него. Жаль, что мое последнее письмо тебе не понравилось. И зачем ты вложил марки? Я на тебя так сердилась. Ужасно хочется, чтобы я могла как-нибудь тебя проучить за это. Я назвала тебя противным мальчишкой, потому что мне совершенно не нравится тот свет. Пожалуйста, объясни мне, что этот твой совет означает?Так ты несчастлив в семейной жизни, мой бедненький противный мальчишка?Ужасно хочется, чтобы я могла чем-нибудь помочь тебе. Напиши мне, пожалуйста, что ты думаешь про меня, бедняжку. Я часто думаю о твоем имени, оно такое красивое. Генри, милый, а когда мы встретимся? Ты просто представить себе не можешь, как часто я о тебе думаю. У меня никогда еще не было такой привязанности к мужчине. Я так страдаю. Пожалуйста, напиши мне длинное письмо, расскажи мне побольше. И помни, если ты этого не сделаешь, я тебя проучу. Вот, знай теперь, что я тебе сделаю, противный мальчишка, если ты не напишешь. Я так мечтаю, чтобы мы встретились. Генри, милый, исполни эту мою просьбу, пока у меня еще есть терпение. Тогда я скажу тебе все. А сейчас я с тобой прощаюсь, мой противный, мой миленький.У меня сегодня ужасно болит голова и напиши поскорее тоскующей по тебе Марте... Напиши мне, какими духами душится твоя жена. Я хочу знать.С глубокомысленным видом он отколол цветок от бумаги, понюхал его почти исчезнувший запах и положил в кармашек у сердца. Язык цветов. Им это нравится, потому что нельзя подслушать. Или отравленный букет, разделаться с ним. Шагая медленно дальше, он перечел еще раз письмо, шепча отдельные слова про себя. Сердились тюльпаны на тебя миленький мужецвет проучить твой кактус если ты пожалуйста бедняжка незабудка я так мечтаю фиалки мой милый розы когда же мы анемоны встретимся противный ночной пестик жена духи Марте[]. Он перечел до конца, вынул его из газеты и спрятал обратно в боковой карман.Тихая радость приоткрыла его губы. Не сравнить с первым письмом.Интересно, сама писала? Разыгрывает возмущение: я девушка из хорошей семьи, пример добродетели. Могли бы встретиться в воскресенье после мессы.Большое спасибо  не по моей части. Обычная любовная драчка. Потом разбегутся по углам. Не лучше, чем сцены с Молли. Сигара успокаивает.Наркотик. В следующий раз пойти еще дальше. Противный мальчишка, проучить: боится слов, конечно. Что-нибудь шокирующее, а? Стоит попробовать. Каждый раз понемножку.Продолжая ощупывать письмо в кармане, он вытащил из него булавку.Простая булавка? Он бросил ее на землю. Откуда-нибудь из одежды: что-то закалывала. Это немыслимо, сколько на них булавок. Нет розы без шипов.Грубые дублинские голоса взвыли у него в голове. В ту ночь в Куме, две девки, обнявшись под дождем:Эх, у Мэри панталоны на одной булавке.А булавка упадет -Как домой она дойдет,Как домой она дойдет?Кто? Мэри. Ужасно болит голова. Наверно, их месячные розы. Или целый день за машинкой. Вредно для нервов желудка. Зрительное напряжение. Какими духами душится твоя жена? Додумалась, а?Как домой она дойдет?Марта, Мэри. Мария и Марфа. Где-то я видел эту картину, забыл уже, старого мастера или подделка. Он сидит у них в доме, разговаривает[].Таинственно. Те девки из Кума тоже слушали бы.Как домой она дойдет?Приятное вечернее чувство. Скитанья кончены. Можешь расслабиться  мирные сумерки  пусть все идет своим чередом. Забудь. Рассказывай о тех местах, где ты был, о чужих обычаях. Другая, с кувшином на голове, готовила ужин: фрукты, маслины, прохладная вода из колодца, хладнокаменного, как дырка в стене в Эштауне[]. В следующий раз, как пойду на бега, надо будет прихватить бумажный стаканчик. Она слушает с расширенными глазами, темные ласковые глаза. Рассказывай  еще и еще  все расскажи. И потом вздох: молчание. Долгий  долгий  долгий покой.Проходя под железнодорожным мостом, он вынул конверт, проворно изорвал на клочки и пустил по ветру. Клочки разлетелись, быстро падая вниз в сыром воздухе: белая стайка, потом все попадали.Генри Флауэр. Вот так можно разорвать и чек на сто фунтов. Простой листик бумаги. Лорд Айви явился как-то в Ирландский банк с семизначным чеком, получил миллион наличными. Вот и смотри, что можно взять на портере. Зато другой братец, лорд Ардилон, говорят, должен менять рубашку четыре раза на день[]. Какие-то вши, не то черви. Миллион фунтов, минутку.Два пенса  это пинта, четыре  кварта, значит, галлон портера восемь пенсов, хотя нет, шиллинг четыре пенса. Двадцать поделить на один и четыре: примерно пятнадцать. Так, точно. Пятнадцать миллионов бочонков портера.Что я говорю, бочонков? Галлонов. Но все равно около миллиона бочонков.Прибывающий поезд тяжело пролязгал над головой у него, один вагон за другим. В голове стукались бочонки; плескался и переливался мутный портер.Затычки вылетели, полился мощный мутный поток, растекаясь по грязной земле, петляя, образуя озерки и водовороты хмельной влаги и увлекая с собой широколистые цветы ее пены.Он подошел к отворенным задним дверям церкви Всех Святых. Ступив на крыльцо, снял шляпу, вытащил из кармана визитную карточку и снова засунул ее за кожаный ободок. Тьфу ты. Ведь мог прощупать Маккоя насчет бесплатного проезда в Моллингар.Прежнее объявление на дверях. Проповедь высокопреподобного Джона Конми[] О.И.[], о святом Петре Клавере О.И. и об африканской миссии. Спасать миллионы китайцев. Как они ухитряются это растолковать косоглазым. Те предпочли бы унцию опиума. Жители Небесной Империи. Для них первейшая ересь. За обращение Гладстона[] молились, когда был уже почти в беспамятстве. Протестанты такие же. Обратить в истинную веру Вильяма Дж.Уолша, доктора Богословия. Ихний бог  Будда, что на боку в музее лежит[]. Подложил руку под голову, прохлаждается. Возжигают курения.Непохоже на  []. Терновый венец и крест.Трилистник  хорошая придумка святого Патрика[]. А едят палочками? Конми:Мартин Каннингем[] с ним знаком: почтенного вида. Надо было к нему пойти, когда устраивал Молли в хор, а не к этому отцу Фарли, что на вид простачок, а на самом деле. Так учат их. Уж этот не отправится крестить негритят: пот ручьями, солнечные очки. А те дивились бы на очки, как сверкают. Забавно бы поглядеть, как они там сидят в кружок, развесив толстые губищи, и в полном восторге слушают. Натюрморт. Лакают, как молочко.Прохладный запах святых камней влек его. Он поднялся по истертым ступеням, толкнул дверь и тихонько вошел.Что то тут делается: служба какой-то общины. Жаль, что так пусто.Отличное укромное местечко, где бы пристроиться рядом с приятной девушкой.Кто мой ближний[]? Часами в тесноте, под тягучую музыку. Та женщина у вечерней мессы. На седьмом небе. Женщины стали на колени у своих скамей, опустив головы, вокруг шей алые ленточки[]. Часть стала на колени у алтарной решетки. Священник обходил их, шепотом бормоча, держа в руках эту штуку.Возле каждой он останавливался, вынимал причастие, стряхивал одну-две капли (они что, в воде?) и аккуратненько клал ей в рот. Ее шляпа и голова дернулись вниз. К следующей: маленькая старушка. Священник наклонился, чтобы положить его ей в рот, все время продолжая шептать. Латынь. К следующей. Закрой глаза, открой рот. Что? []. Тело.Труп. Хорошая находка, латынь. Первым делом их одурманить. Приют для умирающих. Кажется, они это не жуют: сразу глотают. Дикая идея  есть куски трупа. То-то каннибалы клюют на это.Он стоял чуть поодаль, глядя, как их незрячие маски движутся вереницей по проходу, ищут свои места. Потом подошел к скамье и сел с краю, продолжая держать свои газету и шляпу. И что за горшки мы носим. Шляпы надо бы делать по форме головы. Они были рассеяны вокруг, там и сям, головы все еще опущены, алые ленточки, ждут, пока это растопится в их желудках. Вроде мацы, тот же сорт хлеба: пресные хлебы предложения[]. Только посмотреть на них. Так и видно, как счастливы. Конфетка. Счастливы до предела. Да, это называется хлеб ангелов[]. За этим большая идея, чувствуешь что-то в том роде, что Царство Божие внутри нас. Первые причастники. Чудо для крошек леденец за грошик[]. После этого они все чувствуют себя как одна семья, то же самое в театре, все заодно. Конечно, чувствуют, я уверен. Не так одиноко: мы все собратья. Потом в приподнятых чувствах. Дает разрядку.Во что веришь по-настоящему, это и существует. Исцеления в Лурде, воды забвения, явление в Ноке[], кровоточащие статуи. Старикан заснул возле исповедальни. Оттуда и храп. Слепая вера. Обеспечил местечко в грядущем царствии. Убаюкивает все страдания. Разбудите в это же время через год.Он увидел, как священник убрал чашу с причастием куда-то внутрь и на мгновение стал на колени перед ней, выставив серую большую подметку из-под кружевного балахона, что был на нем. А вдруг и у него на одной булавке.Как он домой дойдет? Сзади круглая плешь. На спине буквы. И.Н.Ц.И.[]? Нет: И.Х.С. Молли мне как-то объяснила. Ищу храм святости  или нет: ищу храм страдания, вот как. А те, другие? И нас целиком искупил.Встретиться в воскресенье после мессы. Исполни эту мою просьбу.Появится под вуалью и с черной сумочкой. В сумерках и против света[]. Могла бы быть тут, с ленточкой на шее, и все равно тайком проделывать такие делишки. Они способны. Тот гусь, что выдал непобедимых[], он каждое утро ходил, Кэри его звали, к причастию. Вот в эту самую церковь. Питер Кэри.Нет, это у меня Петр Клавер в голове[]. Дэнис Кэри. Представить только себе.Дома жена и шестеро детей. И все время готовил это убийство. Эти святоши, вот самое подходящее для них слово, в них всегда что-то скользкое. И в делах тоже они виляют. Да нет, ее нет здесь  цветок  нет, нет. А кстати, конверт-то я разорвал? Да-да, под мостом.Священник ополоснул потир, потом залпом ловко опрокинул остатки[]. Вино.Так аристократичней чем если бы он пил что уж они там пьют портер Гиннесса или что-нибудь безалкогольное дублинское горькое Уитли или имбирный эль (ароматизированный) Кантрелла и Кокрейна. Им не дает: вино предложения: только то, другое. Скупятся. Святые мошенники; но правильно делают: иначе бы все пьянчужки сбегались клянчить. Странная атмосфера в этих. Правильно делают. Совершенно правы[].Мистер Блум оглянулся на хоры. Музыки никакой не будет. Жаль. Кто у них органист? Старый Глинн, вот тот умел заставить инструмент говорить, вибрато : по слухам, пятьдесят фунтов в год ему платили на Гардинер-стрит. В тот день Молли была очень в голосе,  [] Россини. Сначала проповедь отца Бернарда Вохена[].Христос или Пилат? Да Христос, только не томи нас всю ночь. Вот музыку они хотели. Шарканье прекратилось. Булавка упадет  слышно. Я ей посоветовал направлять голос в тот угол. Волнение так и чувствовалось в воздухе, на пределе, все даже головы подняли:  []!В этой старой церковной музыке есть чудесные вещи. Меркаданте: семь последних слов[]. Двенадцатая месса Моцарта, а из нее  []. Папы в старину знали толк и в музыке и в искусстве, во всяческих статуях, картинах. Или Палестрина, к примеру. Пока так было, в добрые старые времена, славная была жизнь. И для здоровья полезно, пение, правильный режим, потом варили ликеры. Бенедиктин. Зеленый шартрез. Но все-таки держать в хоре кастратов это уж что-то слишком. А какие это голоса? Наверно, интересно было слушать после их собственных густых басов.Знатоки. Должно быть, они после этого ничего не чувствуют. Некая безмятежность. Не о чем беспокоиться. Жиреют, что им еще? Высокие длинноногие обжоры. Кто знает? Кастрат. Тоже выход из положения.Он увидел, как священник нагнулся и поцеловал алтарь, потом, повернувшись к собравшимся, благословил их. Все перекрестились и встали.Мистер Блум оглянулся по сторонам и тоже встал, глядя поверх поднявшихся шляп. Встают  это конечно для евангелия. Потом все опять стали на колени, а он спокойно уселся на скамью. Священник сошел с алтарного возвышения, держа перед собой предмет, и они с прислужником стали друг другу отвечать по-латыни. Потом священник стал на колени и начал читать по бумажке: Господь наше прибежище и сила нашаМистер Блум подался вперед, чтобы уловить слова. Английский. Бросить им кость. Еще что-то помню. Когда был у мессы последний раз? Преславная и непорочная дева. Супруг ее Иосиф. Петр и Павел. Так интересней, когда понимаешь, о чем все это. Блестящая организация, это факт, работает как часы. Исповедь. Все стремятся. Тогда я скажу тебе все. Раскаяние. Прошу вас, накажите меня. Сильнейшее оружие в их руках. Сильней, чем у доктора или адвоката. Женщины просто с ума сходят. А я шушушушушушу. А вы бубубубубубу? Зачем же это вы? Разглядывает свое кольцо, ищет оправдание.Шепчущая галерея, у стен есть уши. Муж, к своему изумлению, узнает.Господь слегка подшутил. Потом она выходит. Раскаяние на пять минут. Мило пристыжена. Молитва у алтаря. Аве Мария да святая Мария. Цветы, ладан, оплывающие свечи. Прячет румянец. Армия спасения  жалкая подделка. Перед нашим собранием выступит раскаявшаяся блудница. Как я обрела Господа. В Риме, должно быть, головастые парни: это они ведь заправляют всей лавочкой. И денежки хорошие загребают. Завещания: приходскому священнику в его полное распоряжение. Служить мессы за упокой моей души всенародно при открытых дверях. Монастыри мужские и женские. В деле о завещании Ферманы священник в числе свидетелей. Этого не собьешь. Ответ заранее на все готов. Свобода и возвышение нашей святой матери церкви. Учители церкви, они на это придумали целое богословие.Священник молился: Блаженный архангеле Михаиле, огради нас в час бедствий[]. Сохрани нас от злобы и козней диавола (смиренно молим, да укротит его Господь); и властию Божией, о княже воинства небесного, низрини его, сатану, во ад, и с ним купно прочих злых бесов, кои рыщут по свету погибели ради душ наших.Священник с прислужником встали и пошли прочь. Кончено. Женщины еще остались: благодарение.Пора убираться. Брат Обирало. Вдруг пойдет с блюдом. Вноси свою лепту.Он поднялся. Эге. Это что же, две пуговицы на жилете так и были расстегнуты. Женщины в таких случаях в восторге. Никогда не скажут тебе.Любят, когда у тебя слегка растрепанный вид. А уж мы-то. Простите, мисс, тут у вас (гмм!) крохотная (гмм!) пушинка. Или крючок расстегнется сзади на юбке. Проблеск луны[]. Досадуют, если ты не, Что же ты раньше не сказал?Хорошо еще тут, а не дальше к югу. Он прошел меж скамей, незаметно застегиваясь на ходу, и главною дверью вышел на свет. Зажмурясь, он остановился на миг возле холодной черной мраморной чаши, покуда сзади и спереди от него две богомолки окунали робкие руки в мелководье святой воды. Трамваи  фургон из красильни Прескотта  вдовица в трауре. Замечаю, потому что сам в трауре. Он надел шляпу. Сколько там набежало? Четверть?Хватает времени. Стоит сейчас заказать лосьон. Где это? Ах да, в прошлый раз. Свени на Линкольн-плейс. Аптекари редко переезжают. Эти бутыли их зеленые, золотые, не очень сдвинешь. Аптека Гамильтона Лонга основана в год наводнения. Недалеко от гугенотского кладбища. Зайти как-нибудь.Он двинулся в южном направлении по Уэстленд-роу. А ведь рецепт-то в тех брюках. Ох, да и ключ там же. Морока с этими похоронами. Ну ладно, он, бедный, не виноват. Когда я заказывал это дело в последний раз? Постой-ка.Еще, помню, разменял соверен. Должно быть, первого числа или второго. По книге заказов можно найти.Аптекарь перелистывал страницу за страницей назад. От него будто пахнет чем-то песочным, ссохшимся. Сморщенный череп. Старик. Ищут философский камень. Алхимия. Наркотики дают возбуждение, а потом старят. Потом летаргия. А почему? Реакция. Целая жизнь за одну ночь. Характер постепенно меняется. Живешь постоянно среди трав, мазей, лекарств. Все эти алебастровые горшочки. Ступка и пестик. . . . .  [] Уже один запах почти вылечивает, как позвонить в дверь к зубному. Доктор Коновал. Ему бы самому подлечиться. Лечебная кашка или эмульсия. Кто первый решился нарвать травы и лечиться ею, это был храбрый малый. Целебные травы. Нужна осторожность. Тут хватит всего вокруг, чтобы тебя хлороформировать. Проверка: синяя лакмусовая бумажка краснеет.Хлороформ. Чрезмерная доза опия. Снотворное. Приворотные зелья. Парегорик, маковый сироп, вреден при кашле. Закупоривает поры или мокроту. Яды, вот единственные лекарства. Исцеление там, где не ожидаешь. Мудрость природы. Примерно две недели назад, сэр? Да,  ответил мистер Блум.Он ждал у конторки, вдыхая едкую вонь лекарств, сухой пыльный запах губок и люффы. Долгая история выкладывать про свои болячки. Миндальное масло и бензойная настойка,  сказал мистер Блум,  и потом померанцевая водаОт этого лосьона кожа у нее делается нежная и белая, точно воск. И еще воск,  добавил он.Подчеркивает темный цвет глаз. Смотрела на меня, натянув простыню до этих самых глаз, испанских, нюхала себя, пока я продевал запонки. Домашние средства часто самые лучшие: клубника для зубов, крапива и дождевая вода, а еще, говорят, толокно с пахтаньем. Питает кожу. Один из сыновей старой королевы, герцог Олбани, кажется, у него была всего одна кожа[]. Да, у Леопольда. А у всех нас по три. В придачу угри, мозоли и бородавки. Но тебе еще нужно и духи. Какими духами твоя?  []. Тот флердоранж. Чистое ядровое мыло. Вода очень освежает.Приятный у этого мыла запах. Еще успеваю в баню, тут за углом. Хаммам.Турецкая. Массаж. Грязь скапливается в пупке. Приятней, если бы хорошенькая девушка это делала. Да я думаю и я. Да, я. В ванне этим заняться. Странное желание я. Вода к воде. Полезное с приятным. Жалко, нет времени на массаж. Потом весь день чувство свежести. Похороны мраку нагонят. Вот, сэр,  отыскал аптекарь.  Это стоило два и девять. А склянка у вас найдется с собой? Нет,  сказал мистер Блум.  Вы приготовьте, пожалуйста, а я зайду попоздней сегодня. И я возьму еще мыло, какое-нибудь из этих. Они почем? Четыре пенса, сэр.Мистер Блум поднес кусок к носу. Сладковато-лимонный воск. Вот это я возьму,  решил он.  Итого будет три и пенни. Да, сэр,  сказал аптекарь.  Вы можете заплатить за все сразу, когда придете. Хорошо,  сказал мистер Блум.Он вышел из аптеки, не торопясь, держа под мышкой трубку газеты и в левой руке мыло в прохладной обертке.У самой подмышки голос и рука Бэнтама Лайонса сказали: Приветствую, Блум, что новенького? Это сегодняшняя? Вы не покажете на минутку?Фу ты, опять усы сбрил. Длинная, холодная верхняя губа. Чтобы выглядеть помоложе. А выглядит по-дурацки. Он моложе меня.Пальцы Бэнтама Лайонса, желтые, с чернотой под ногтями, развернули газету. Ему бы тоже помыться. Содрать корку грязи. Доброе утро, вы не забыли воспользоваться мылом Пирса? По плечам перхоть. Череп бы смазывал. Хочу взглянуть насчет французской лошадки, что сегодня бежит,  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс.  Черт, да где тут она?Он шелестел мятыми страницами, ерзая подбородком туда-сюда по тугому воротничку. Зуд после бритья. От такого воротничка волосы будут лезть.Оставить ему газету, чтоб отвязался. Можете взять себе,  сказал мистер Блум. Аскот. Золотой кубок. Постойте,  бормотал Бэнтам Лайонс.  Один мо.Максим Второй. Я здесь только рекламу смотрел,  добавил мистер Блум.Внезапно Бэнтам Лайонс поднял на него глаза, в которых мелькнуло хитрое выражение. Как-как вы сказали?  переспросил он отрывисто. Я говорю: можете взять себе,  повторил мистер Блум.  Я все равно хотел выбросить, только посмотрел рекламу.Бэнтам Лайонс с тем же выражением в глазах поколебался минуту  потом сунул раскрытые листы обратно мистеру Блуму. Ладно, рискну,  проговорил он.  Держите, спасибо.Едва не бегом он двинулся в сторону Конвея. Прыть как у зайца.Мистер Блум, усмехнувшись, снова сложил листы аккуратным прямоугольником и поместил между ними мыло. Дурацкие стали губы. Играет на скачках. Последнее время просто повальная зараза. Мальчишки-посыльные воруют, чтобы поставить шесть пенсов. Разыгрывается в лотерею отборная нежная индейка. Рождественский ужин за три пенса. Джек Флеминг играл на казенные деньги, а после сбежал в Америку. Теперь владелец отеля. Назад никогда не возвращаются. Котлы с мясом в земле египетской.Бодрой походкой он приблизился к мечети турецких бань. Напоминает мечеть, красные кирпичи, минареты. Я вижу, сегодня университетские велогонки. Он рассматривал афишу в форме подковы над воротами Колледж-парка: велосипедист, согнувшийся в три погибели. Бездарная афишка.Сделали бы круглую, как колесо. Внутри спицы: гонки  гонки  гонки; а по ободу: университетские. Вот это бы бросалось в глаза.Вон и Хорнблоуэр у ворот. С ним стоит поддерживать: мог бы туда пропускать за так. Как поживаете, мистер Хорнблоуэр? Как поживаете, сэр?Погодка прямо райская. Если бы в жизни всегда так. Погода для крикета.Рассядутся под навесами. Удар за ударом. Промах. Здесь для крикета тесновато. Подряд шесть воротцев. Капитан Буллер пробил по левому краю и вышиб окно в клубе на Килдер-стрит. Таким игрокам место на ярмарке в Доннибруке. Эх, башки мы им открутим, как на поле выйдет Джек[]. Волна тепла. Не слишком надолго. Вечно бегущий поток жизни: ищет в потоке жизни наш взгляд[], что нам доро-о-оже всего.А теперь насладимся баней: чистая ванна с водой, прохладная эмаль, теплый, ласкающий поток. Сие есть тело мое[].Он видел заранее свое бледное тело, целиком погруженное туда, нагое в лоне тепла, умащенное душистым тающим мылом, мягко омываемое. Он видел свое туловище и члены, покрытые струйной рябью, невесомо зависшие, слегка увлекаемые вверх, лимонно-желтые; свой пуп, завязь плоти; и видел, как струятся темные спутанные пряди поросли и струятся пряди потока вокруг поникшего отца тысяч[], вяло колышущегося цветка.Эпизод []Мартин Каннингем, первый, просунул оцилиндренную голову внутрь скрипучей кареты и, ловко войдя, уселся. За ним шагнул мистер Пауэр, пригибаясь из-за своего роста. Садитесь, Саймон. После вас,  сказал мистер Блум.Мистер Дедал надел живо шляпу и поднялся в карету, проговорив: Да-да. Все уже здесь?  спросил Мартин Каннингем.  Забирайтесь, Блум.Мистер Блум вошел и сел на свободное место. Потом взялся за дверцу и плотно притянул ее, пока она не закрылась плотно. Продел руку в петлю и с серьезным видом посмотрел через открытое окошко кареты на спущенные шторы соседских окон. Одна отдернута: старуха глазеет. Приплюснула нос к стеклу: побелел. Благодарит небо, что не ее черед. Поразительно, какой у них интерес к трупам. Рады нас проводить на тот свет так тяжко родить на этот.Занятие в самый раз по ним. Шушуканье по углам. Шмыгают неслышно в шлепанцах боятся еще проснется. Потом прибрать его. Положить на стол.Молли и миссис Флеминг стелют ложе[]. Подтяните слегка к себе. Наш саван. Не узнаешь кто тебя мертвого будет трогать. Обмыть тело, голову. Ногти и волосы, кажется, подрезают. Часть на память в конвертик. Потом все равно отрастают. Нечистое занятие.Все ждали, не говоря ни слова. Наверно, венки выносят. На что-то твердое сел. А, это мыло в заднем кармане. Лучше убрать оттуда. Подожди случая.Все ждали. Потом спереди донеслись звуки колес  ближе  потом стук копыт. Тряхнуло. Карета тронулась, скрипя и покачиваясь. Послышались другие копыта и скрипучие колеса, сзади. Проплыли соседские окна и номер девятый с открытой дверью, с крепом на дверном молотке. Шагом.Они еще выжидали, с подпрыгивающими коленями, покуда не повернули и не поехали вдоль трамвайной линии. Трайтонвилл-роуд. Быстрей. Колеса застучали по булыжной мостовой, и расшатанные стекла запрыгали, стуча, в рамах. По какой это он дороге?  спросил мистер Пауэр в оба окошка. Айриштаун,  ответил Мартин Каннингем.  Рингсенд. Брансвик-стрит.Мистер Дедал, поглядев наружу, кивнул. Хороший старый обычай[],  сказал он.  Отрадно, что еще не забыт.С минуту все смотрели в окна на фуражки и шляпы, приподнимаемые прохожими. Дань уважения. Карета, миновав Уотери-лейн, свернула с рельсов на более гладкую дорогу. Взгляд мистера Блума заметил стройного юношу в трауре и широкополой шляпе. Тут мимо один ваш друг, Дедал,  сказал он. Кто это? Ваш сын и наследник. Где он там?  спросил мистер Дедал, перегибаясь к окну напротив.Карета, миновав улицу с доходными домами и развороченной, в канавах и ямах, мостовой, свернула, накренившись, за угол и снова покатила вдоль рельсов, громко стуча колесами. Мистер Дедал откинулся назад и спросил: А этот прохвост Маллиган тоже с ним? Его  []? Да нет, он один,  ответил мистер Блум. От тетушки Салли, надо думать,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Эта шайка Гулдингов, пьяненький счетоводишка и Крисси, папочкина вошка-сикушка[], то мудрое дитя, что узнает отца[].Мистер Блум бесстрастно усмехнулся, глядя на Рингсенд-роуд. Братья Уоллес, производство бутылок. Мост Доддер.Ричи Гулдинг с портфелем стряпчего. Гулдинг, Коллис и Уорд, так он всем называет фирму. Его шуточки уже сильно с бородой. А был хоть куда.Воскресным утром танцевал на улице вальс с Игнатием Галлахером[], на Стеймер-стрит, напялив две хозяйкины шляпы на голову. Ночи напролет куролесил. Теперь начинает расплачиваться: боюсь, что эта его боль в пояснице. Жена утюжит спину. Думает вылечиться пилюльками. А в них один хлеб. Процентов шестьсот чистой прибыли. Связался со всяким сбродом,  продолжал сварливо мистер Дедал.  Этот Маллиган, вам любой скажет, это отпетый бандит, насквозь испорченный тип. От одного его имени воняет по всему Дублину. Но с помощью Божией и Пресвятой Девы, я им особо займусь, я напишу его матери, или тетке, или кто она там ему такое письмо, что у нее глаза полезут на лоб. Я тыл ему коленом почешу[], могу вас заверить.Он силился перекричать громыханье колес: Я не позволю, чтобы этот ублюдок, ее племянничек, губил бы моего сына. Отродье зазывалы из лавки. Шнурки продает у моего родича, Питера Пола Максвайни[]. Не выйдет.Он смолк. Мистер Блум перевел взгляд с его сердитых усов на кроткое лицо мистера Пауэра, потом на глаза и бороду Мартина Каннингема, которые солидно покачивались. Шумливый человек, своевольный. Носится со своим сыном. И правильно. Что-то после себя оставить. Если бы Руди, малютка, остался жить. Видеть, как он растет. Слышать голосок в доме. Как идет рядом с Молли в итонской курточке[]. Мой сын. Я в его глазах. Странное было бы ощущение. От меня. Слепой случай. Это видно тем утром на Реймонд-террас она из окна глядела как две собаки случаются под стеной не содейте зла[]. И сержант ухмылялся. Она была в том палевом халате с прорехой, так и не собралась зашить. Польди, давай мы. Ох, я так хочу, умираю. Так начинается жизнь.Потом в положении. Пришлось отменить концерт в Грейстоуне. Мой сын в ней. Я мог бы его поставить на ноги. Мог бы. Сделать самостоятельным. Немецкому научить. Мы не опаздываем?  спросил мистер Пауэр. На десять минут,  сказал Мартин Каннингем, посмотрев на часы.Молли. Милли. То же самое, но пожиже. Ругается как мальчишка. Катись колбаской! Чертики с рожками! Нет, она милая девчушка. Станет уж скоро женщиной. Моллингар. Дражайший папулька. Студент. Да, да: тоже женщина, Жизнь. Жизнь.Карету качнуло взад-вперед и с ней четыре их ту лова. Корни мог бы нам дать какую-нибудь колымагу поудобней,  заметил мистер Пауэр. Мог бы,  сказал мистер Дедал,  если бы он так не косил. Вы меня понимаете?Он прищурил левый глаз. Мартин Каннингем начал смахивать хлебные крошки со своего сиденья. Что это еще, Боже милостивый?  проговорил он.  Крошки? Похоже, что кто-то тут устраивал недавно пикник,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Все привстали, недовольно оглядывая прелую, с оборванными пуговицами, кожу сидений. Мистер Дедал покрутил носом, глядя вниз, поморщился и сказал: Или я сильно ошибаюсь Как вам кажется, Мартин? Я и сам поразился,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Блум опустился на сиденье. Удачно, что зашел в баню. Ноги чувствуешь совершенно чистыми. Вот только бы еще миссис Флеминг заштопала эти носки получше.Мистер Дедал, отрешенно вздохнув, сказал: В конце концов, это самая естественная вещь на свете. А Том Кернан появился?  спросил Мартин Каннингем, слегка теребя кончик бороды. Да,  ответил мистер Блум.  Он едет за нами с Хайнсом[] и с Недом Лэмбертом. А сам Корни Келлехер?  спросил мистер Пауэр. На кладбище,  сказал Мартин Каннингем. Я встретил утром Маккоя,  сообщил мистер Блум,  и он сказал, тоже постарается приехать.Карета резко остановилась. Что там такое? Застряли. Где мы?Мистер Блум высунул голову из окна. Большой канал,  сказал он.Газовый завод. Говорят, вылечивает коклюш. Повезло, что у Милли этого не было. Бедные дети. Сгибаются пополам в конвульсиях, синеют, чернеют.Просто кошмар. С болезнями сравнительно легко обошлось. Одна корь. Чай из льняного семени. Скарлатина, эпидемии инфлюэнцы Рекламные агенты смерти.Не упустите такого случая. Вон там собачий приют. Старый Атос, бедняга!Будь добрым к Атосу, Леопольд, это мое последнее желание. Да будет воля твоя. Слушаемся их, когда они в могиле. Предсмертные каракули. Он себе места не находил, тосковал. Смирный пес. У стариков обычно такие.Капля дождя упала ему на шляпу. Он спрятал голову и увидел, как серые плиты моментально усеялись темными точками. По отдельности. Интересно. Как через сито. Я так и думал, пойдет. Помнится, подошвы скрипели. Погода меняется,  спокойно сообщил он. Жаль, быстро испортилась,  откликнулся Мартин Каннингем. Для полей нужно,  сказал мистер Пауэр.  А вон и солнце опять выходит.Мистер Дедал, воззрившись через очки на задернутое солнце, послал немое проклятие небесам. Не надежнее, чем попка младенца,  изрек он. Поехали.Колеса с усилием завертелись снова, и торсы сидящих мягко качнуло.Мартин Каннингем живее затеребил кончик бороды. Вчера вечером Том Кернан был грандиозен,  сказал он.  А Падди Леонард[] его передразнивал у него на глазах. О, покажите-ка нам его, Мартин,  оживился мистер Пауэр.  Сейчас вы, Саймон, услышите, как он высказался про исполнение Стриженого паренька[] Беном Доллардом. Грандиозно,  с напыщенностью произнес Мартин Каннингем.  То, как он спел эту простую балладу, Мартин, это самое проникновенное исполнение, какое мне доводилось слышать при всем моем долгом опыте . Проникновенное,  со смехом повторил мистер Пауэр.  Это словечко у него просто пунктик. И еще  ретроспективное упорядочение. Читали речь Дэна Доусона[]?  спросил Мартин Каннингем. Я нет,  сказал мистер Дедал.  А где это? В сегодняшней утренней.Мистер Блум вынул газету из внутреннего кармана. Я еще должен поменять книгу для нее. Нет-нет,  сказал поспешно мистер Дедал.  Потом, пожалуйста.Взгляд мистера Блума скользнул по крайнему столбцу, пробежав некрологи.Каллан, Коулмен, Дигнам, Фоусетт, Лаури, Наумен, Пик, это какой Пик, не тот, что служил у Кроссби и Оллейна? нет, Секстон, Эрбрайт. Черные литеры уже начали стираться на потрепанной и мятой бумаге. Благодарение Маленькому Цветку[]. Горькая утрата. К невыразимой скорби его. В возрасте  лет, после продолжительной и тяжелой болезни. Панихида на тридцатый день.Квинлен. Да помилует Иисус Сладчайший душу его.Уж месяц как Генри ушел без возвратаВ обители вечной он пребываетСемейство скорбит над жестокой утратойНа встречу в горнем краю уповая.А я конверт разорвал? Да. А куда положил письмо, после того как перечитывал в бане? Он ощупал свой жилетный карман. Тут. Генри ушел без возврата. Пока у меня еще есть терпение.Школа. Лесосклад Мида. Стоянка кэбов. Всего два сейчас. Дремлют.Раздулись, как клещи. Мозгов почти нет, одни черепные кости. Еще один трусит с седоком. Час назад я тут проходил. Извозчики приподняли шапки.Спина стрелочника неожиданно выросла, распрямившись, возле трамвайного столба, у самого окна мистера Блума. Разве нельзя придумать что-нибудь автоматическое чтобы колеса сами гораздо удобней? Да но тогда этот парень потеряет работу? Да но зато еще кто-то получит работу, делать то, что придумают?Концертный зал Эншент. Закрыт сегодня. Прохожий в горчичном костюме, с крепом на рукаве. Некрупная скорбь. Четверть траура. Женина родня, скажем.Они проехали мрачную кафедру святого Марка, под железнодорожным мостом, мимо театра Куинз: в молчании. Рекламные щиты. Юджин Стрэттон[], миссис Бэндмен Палмер. А не сходить ли мне на Лию сегодня вечером? Говорил ведь что. Или на Лилию Килларни[]? Оперная труппа Элстер Граймс. Новый сенсационный спектакль. Афиши на будущую неделю, еще влажные, яркие.Бристольские забавы[]. Мартин Каннингем мог бы достать контрамарку в Гэйети. Придется ему поставить. Шило на мыло.Он придет днем. Ее песни.Шляпы Плестоу. Бюст сэра Филипа Крэмптона у фонтана. А кто он был-то? Как поживаете?  произнес Мартин Каннингем, приветственно поднося ладонь ко лбу. Он нас не видит,  сказал мистер Пауэр.  Нет, видит. Как поживаете? Кто?  спросил мистер Дедал. Буян Бойлан,  ответил мистер Пауэр.  Вон он, вышел проветриться.В точности когда я подумал.Мистер Дедал перегнулся поприветствовать. От дверей ресторана Ред бэнк блеснул ответно белый диск соломенной шляпы  скрылся.Мистер Блум осмотрел ногти у себя на левой руке, потом на правой руке.Да, ногти. Что в нем такого есть что они она видит? Наваждение. Ведь хуже не сыщешь в Дублине. Этим и жив. Иногда они человека чувствуют. Инстинкт.Но этакого гуся. Мои ногти. А что, просто смотрю на них: вполне ухожены. А после: одна, раздумывает. Тело не такое уже упругое. Я бы заметил по памяти. Отчего так бывает наверно кожа не успевает стянуться когда с тела спадет. Но фигура еще на месте. Еще как на месте. Плечи Бедра. Полные.Вечером, когда одевалась на бал. Рубашка сзади застряла между половинок.Он зажал руки между колен и отсутствующим, довольным взглядом обвел их лица.Мистер Пауэр спросил: Что слышно с вашим турне, Блум? О, все отлично,  отвечал мистер Блум.  Мнения самые одобрительные. Вы понимаете, такая удачная идея А вы сами поедете? Нет, знаете ли,  сказал мистер Блум.  Мне надо съездить в графство Клэр по одному частному делу. Идея в том, чтобы охватить главные города.Если в одном прогоришь, в других можно наверстать. Очень правильно,  одобрил Мартин Каннингем.  Сейчас там Мэри Андерсон[]. А партнеры у вас хорошие? Ее импресарио Луис Вернер,  сказал мистер Блум.  О да, у нас все из самых видных. Дж.К.Дойл и Джон Маккормак[] я надеюсь и. Лучшие, одним словом. И Мадам,  добавил с улыбкой мистер Пауэр.  Хоть упомянем последней, все равно первая.Мистер Блум развел руками в жесте мягкой учтивости и снова сжал руки.Смит ОБрайен. Кто-то положил букет у подножия. Женщина. Наверно, годовщина смерти. Желаем еще многих счастливых. Объезжая статую Фаррелла[], карета бесшумно сдвинула их несопротивляющиеся колени.Ркии: старик в темных лохмотьях протягивал с обочины свой товар, разевая рот: ркии. Шну-ркии, четыре на пенни.Интересно, за что ему запретили практику. Имел свою контору на Хьюм-стрит. В том же доме, где Твиди, однофамилец Молли, королевский адвокат графства Уотерфорд. Цилиндр с тех пор сохранился. Остатки былой роскоши. Тоже в трауре. Но так скатиться, бедняга! Каждый пинает, как собаку. Последние деньки ОКаллахана[].И Мадам. Двадцать минут двенадцатого. Встала. Миссис Флеминг принялась за уборку. Причесывается, напевает:    . Нет:   []. Рассматривает кончики волос, не секутся ли.     []. Очень красиво у нее это : рыдающий звук.Тревожный. Трепетный. В самом слове трепет уже это слышится.Глаза его скользнули по приветливому лицу мистера Пауэра. Виски седеют.Мадам: и улыбается. Я тоже улыбнулся. Улыбка доходит в любую даль. А может, просто из вежливости. Приятный человек. Интересно, это правду рассказывают насчет его содержанки? Для жены ничего приятного. Но кто-то меня уверял, будто бы между ними ничего плотского. Можно себе представить, тогда у них живо бы все завяло. Да, это Крофтон[] его как-то встретил вечером, он нес ей фунт вырезки. Где же она служила? Барменша в Джури.Или из Мойры?Они проехали под фигурой Освободителя[] в обширном плаще.Мартин Каннингем легонько коснулся мистера Пауэра. Из колена Рувимова[],  сказал он.Высокий чернобородый мужчина с палкой грузно проковылял за угол слоновника Элвери[], показав им за спиной скрюченную горстью ладонь. Во всей своей девственной красе,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Мистер Дедал, поглядев вслед ковыляющей фигуре, пожелал кротко: Чтоб тебе сатана пропорол печенки!Мистер Пауэр, зашедшись неудержимым смехом, заслонил лицо от окна, когда карета проезжала статую Грэя. Мы все это испытали,  заметил неопределенно Мартин Каннингем.Глаза его встретились с глазами мистера Блума. Погладив свою бороду, он добавил: Ну, скажем, почти все из нас.Мистер Блум заговорил с внезапною живостью, вглядываясь в лица спутников. Это просто отличная история, что ходит насчет Рувима Дж. и его сына. Про лодочника?  спросил мистер Пауэр. Да-да. Отличная ведь история? А что там?  спросил мистер Дедал.  Я не слышал. Там возникла какая-то девица,  начал мистер Блум,  и он решил услать его от греха подальше на остров Мэн, но когда они оба Что-что?  переспросил мистер Дедал.  Это этот окаянный уродец? Ну да,  сказал мистер Блум.  Они оба уже шли на пароход, и тот вдруг в воду Варавва в воду[]!  воскликнул мистер Дедал.  Экая жалость, не утонул!Мистер Пауэр снова зашелся смехом, выпуская воздух через заслоненные ноздри. Да нет,  принялся объяснять мистер Блум,  это сынМартин Каннингем бесцеремонно вмешался в его речь. Рувим Дж. с сыном шли по набережной реки к пароходу на остров Мэн, и тут вдруг юный балбес вырвался и через парапет прямо в Лиффи. Боже правый!  воскликнул мистер Дедал в испуге.  И утонул? Утонул!  усмехнулся Мартин Каннингем.  Он утонет! Лодочник его выудил багром за штаны и причалил с ним прямиком к папаше, с полумертвым от страху. Полгорода там столпилось. Да,  сказал мистер Блум,  но самое-то смешное И Рувим Дж.,  продолжал Мартин Каннингем,  пожаловал лодочнику флорин за спасение жизни сына.Приглушенный вздох вырвался из-под ладони мистера Пауэра. Да-да, пожаловал,  подчеркнул Мартин Каннингем.  Героически.Серебряный флорин. Отличная ведь история?  повторил с живостью мистер Блум. Переплатил шиллинг и восемь пенсов,  бесстрастно заметил мистер Дедал.Тихий сдавленный смех мистера Пауэра раздался в карете.Колонна Нельсона. Сливы, восемь на пенни! Восемь на пенни! Давайте-ка мы примем более серьезный вид,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Дедал вздохнул: Бедняга Падди не стал бы ворчать на нас, что мы посмеялись. В свое время сам порассказывал хороших историй. Да простит мне Бог!  проговорил мистер Пауэр, вытирая влажные глаза пальцами.  Бедный Падди! Не думал я неделю назад, когда его встретил последний раз и был он, как всегда, здоровехонек, что буду ехать за ним вот так. Ушел от нас. Из всех, кто только носил шляпу на голове, самый достойный крепышок,  выразился мистер Дедал.  Ушел в одночасье. Удар,  молвил Мартин Каннингем.  Сердце.Печально он похлопал себя по груди.Лицо как распаренное: багровое. Злоупотреблял горячительным. Средство от красноты носа. Пей до чертиков, покуда не станет трупно-серым. Порядком он денег потратил, чтоб перекрасить.Мистер Пауэр смотрел на проплывающие дома со скорбным сочувствием. Бедняга, так внезапно скончался. Наилучшая смерть,  сказал мистер Блум.Они поглядели на него широко открытыми глазами. Никаких страданий,  сказал он.  Момент, и кончено. Как умереть во сне.Все промолчали.Мертвая сторона улицы. Днем всякий унылый бизнес, земельные конторы, гостиница для непьющих, железнодорожный справочник Фолконера, училище гражданской службы, Гилл, католический клуб, общество слепых. Почему?Какая то есть причина. Солнце или ветер. И вечером то же. Горняшки да подмастерья. Под покровительством покойного отца Мэтью[]. Камень для памятника Парнеллу. Удар. Сердце.Белые лошади с белыми султанами галопом вынеслись из-за угла Ротонды.Мелькнул маленький гробик. Спешит в могилу. Погребальная карета.Неженатый. Женатому вороных. Старому холостяку пегих. А монашке мышастых. Грустно,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Какой-то ребенок.Личико карлика, лиловое, сморщенное, как было у малютки Руди. Тельце карлика, мягкое, как замазка, в сосновом гробике с белой обивкой внутри.Похороны оплачены товариществом. Пенни в неделю за клочок на кладбище.Наш. Бедный. Крошка. Младенец. Несмышленыш. Ошибка природы. Если здоров, это от матери. Если нет, от отца. В следующий раз больше повезет. Бедный малютка,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Отмаялся.Карета медленно взбиралась на холм Ратленд-сквер. Растрясут его кости[]. Свалят гроб на погосте. Горемыка безродный. Всему свету чужой. В расцвете жизни[],  промолвил Мартин Каннингем. Но самое худшее,  сказал мистер Пауэр,  это когда человек кончает с собой.Мартин Каннингем быстрым движением вынул часы, кашлянул, спрятал часы обратно. И это такое бесчестье, если у кого-то в семье,  продолжал мистер Пауэр. Временное умопомрачение, разумеется,  решительно произнес Мартин Каннингем.  Надо к этому относиться с милосердием. Говорят, тот, кто так поступает, трус,  сказал мистер Дедал. Не нам судить,  возразил Мартин Каннингем.Мистер Блум, собравшись было заговорить, снова сомкнул уста. Большие глаза Мартина Каннингема. Сейчас отвернулся. Гуманный, сострадательный человек. И умный. На Шекспира похож[]. Всегда найдет доброе слово. А у них никакой жалости насчет этого, и насчет детоубийства тоже. Лишают христианского погребения. Раньше загоняли в могилу кол, в сердце ему. Как будто и так уже не разбито. Но иногда те раскаиваются, слишком поздно.Находят на дне реки[] вцепившимися в камыши. Посмотрел на меня. Жена у него жуткая пьянчужка[]. Сколько раз он заново обставит квартиру, а она мебель закладывает чуть ли не каждую субботу. Жизнь как у проклятого. Это надо каменное сердце. Каждый понедельник все заново. Тяни лямку. Матерь Божья, хороша же она была в тот вечер. Дедал рассказывал, он там был. Как есть в стельку, и приплясывает с мартиновым зонтиком:На Востоке слыву я первейшейАх, первейшей Красавицей гейшей[].Опять отвернулся. Знает. Растрясут его кости.В тот день, дознание. На столе пузырек с красным ярлыком. Номер в гостинице, с охотничьими картинками. Духота. Солнце просвечивает сквозь жалюзи. Уши следователя крупные, волосатые. Показания коридорного. Сперва подумал, он спит. Потом увидал на лице вроде как желтые потеки. Свесился с кровати. Заключение: чрезмерная доза. Смерть в результате неосторожности.Письмо. Моему сыну Леопольду.Не будет больше мучений. Никогда не проснешься. Всему свету чужой.Лошади припустили вскачь по Блессингтон-стрит. Свалят гроб на погосте. А мы разогнались, я вижу,  заметил Мартин Каннингем. Авось, он нас не перевернет,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Надеюсь, нет,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  В Германии завтра большие гонки. Кубок Гордона Беннета[]. Да, убей бог,  хмыкнул мистер Дедал.  Это бы стоило посмотреть.Когда они свернули на Беркли-стрит, уличная шарманка возле Бассейна встретила и проводила их разухабистым скачущим мотивчиком мюзик-холла. Не видали Келли[]? Ка  е два эл  и. Марш мертвых из Саула[]. Этот старый негодник Антонио[]. Меня бросил без всяких резонио. Пируэт! Скорбящая Божья Матерь. Экклс-стрит. Там дальше мой дом. Большая больница. Вон там палата для безнадежных. Это обнадеживает. Приют Богоматери для умирающих.Мертвецкая тут же в подвале, удобно. Где умерла старая миссис Риордан[]. Эти женщины, ужасно на них смотреть. Ее кормят из чашки, подбирают ложечкой вокруг рта. Потом обносят кровать ширмой, оставляют умирать. Славный был тот студент, к которому я пришел с пчелиным укусом. Потом сказали, он перешел в родильный приют. Из одной крайности в другую.Карета завернула галопом за угол  и стала. Что там еще?Стадо клейменого скота, разделившись, обтекало карету, тяжело ступая разбитыми копытами, мыча, лениво обмахивая хвостами загаженные костлявые крупы. По бокам и в гуще гурта трусили меченые овцы, блея от страха. Эмигранты,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Гей! Гей!  покрикивал голос скотогона, бич его щелкал по их бокам.  Гей! С дороги!Конечно, четверг. Завтра же день забоя. Молодняк. У Каффа шли в среднем по двадцать семь фунтов. Видимо, в Ливерпуль. Ростбиф для старой Англии[].Скупают самых упитанных. И потом пятая четверть теряется: все это сырье, шерсть, шкуры, рога. За год наберется очень порядочно. Торговля убоиной.Побочные продукты с боен идут кожевникам, на мыло, на маргарин. Интересно, еще действует этот трюк, когда можно было мясо с душком покупать прямо с поезда, в Клонзилле.Карета пробиралась сквозь стадо. Не могу понять, почему муниципалитет не проложит линию трамвая от ворот парка к набережным,  сказал мистер Блум.  Можно было бы весь этот скот доставлять вагонами прямо на пароходы. Чем загораживать движение,  поддержал Мартин Каннингем.  Очень правильно. Так и надо бы сделать. Да,  продолжал мистер Блум,  и еще другое я часто думаю, это чтобы устроили похоронные трамваи, знаете, как в Милане. Провести линию до кладбища и пустить специальные трамваи, катафалк, траурный кортеж, все как положено. Вы понимаете мою идею? Ну, это уж анекдот какой-то,  молвил мистер Дедал.  Вагон спальный и вагон-ресторан. Печальные перспективы для Корни,  добавил мистер Пауэр. Почему же?  возразил мистер Блум, оборачиваясь к мистеру Дедалу.  Разве не будет это приличней, чем трястись вот так парами, нос к носу? Ну ладно, может, тут и есть что-то,  снизошел мистер Дедал. И к тому же,  сказал Мартин Каннингем,  мы бы избавились от сцен вроде той, когда катафалк перевернулся у Данфи и опрокинул гроб на дорогу. Совершенно ужасный случай!  сказало потрясенное лицо мистера Пауэра. И труп вывалился на мостовую. Ужасно! Первым на повороте у Данфи,  одобрительно кивнул мистер Дедал.  На кубок Гордона Беннета. Господи помилуй!  произнес набожно Мартин Каннингем.Трах! На попа! Гроб грохается об мостовую. Крышка долой. Падди Дигнам вылетает и катится в пыли как колода в коричневом костюме, который ему велик. Красное лицо  сейчас серое. Рот разинут. Спрашивает, чего такое творится. Правильно закрывают им. Жуткое зрелище с открытым. И внутренности быстрей разлагаются. Самое лучшее закрыть все отверстия. Ага, и там. Воском. Сфинктер расслабляется. Все заткнуть. Данфи,  объявил мистер Пауэр, когда карета повернула направо.Перекресток Данфи. Стоят траурные кареты: залить горе. Придорожный привал. Для трактира идеальное место. Наверняка заглянем на обратном пути пропустить за его здоровье. Чаша утешения. Эликсир жизни.А допустим правда случилось бы. Пошла бы у него кровь скажем если бы напоролся на гвоздь? И да и нет, я так думаю. Смотря где. Кровообращение останавливается. Но из артерии еще сколько-нибудь может вытечь. Было бы лучше хоронить в красном. В темно-красном.Они ехали молча по Фибсборо-роуд. Навстречу с кладбища пустой катафалк: с облегченным видом.Мост Кроссганс: королевский канал.Вода с ревом устремлялась сквозь шлюзы. Человек стоял на опускающейся барже между штабелями сухого торфа. У створа, на буксирной тропе, лошадь на длинной привязи. Плавание на Бугабу[].Глаза их смотрели на него. По медленным тинистым каналам и рекам проплыл он в своем дощанике через всю Ирландию к побережью на буксирном канате мимо зарослей камыша, над илом, увязшими бутылками, трупами дохлых псов. Атлон, Моллингар, Мойвэлли, я бы мог Милли навестить пешим ходом, шагай себе вдоль канала. Или на велосипеде. Взять старенький напрокат, никакого риска. У Рена был как-то на торгах, только дамский. Улучшать водные пути. У Джеймса Макканна[] хобби катать меня на пароме. Дешевый транспорт. Малыми расстояниями. Плавучие палатки. Туризм. И катафалки можно. Водой на небо. А что, поехать вот так, без предупреждения. Сюрприз.Лейкслип, Клонзилла. Спустился, шлюз за шлюзом, до Дублина. С торфом из внутренних болот. Привет. Он снял соломенную порыжелую шляпу, приветствуя Падди Дигнама.Проехали дом Брайена Бороиме[]. Близко уже. Интересно, как там наш друг Фогарти[],  сказал мистер Пауэр. Спросите у Тома Кернана,  отозвался мистер Дедал. Как так?  спросил Мартин Каннингем.  Я думал, он ему сделал ручкой. Хоть скрылся из глаз, но для памяти дорог[],  промолвил мистер Дедал.Карета повернула налево по Финглас-роуд.Направо камнерезные мастерские. Финишная прямая. На полоске земли столпились безмолвные фигуры, белые, скорбные, простирая безгневно руки, в горе пав на колени, с указующим жестом. Тесаные куски фигур. В белом безмолвии  взывают. Обширный выбор. Том.Х.Деннани, скульптор и изготовитель надгробий.Проехали.Перед домом Джимми Гири, могильщика, сидел на обочине старый бродяга и ворча вытряхивал сор и камешки из здоровенного пропыленного башмака с зияющей пастью. После жизненного странствия.Потянулись угрюмые сады один за другим  угрюмые дома.Мистер Пауэр показал рукой. Вон там был убит Чайлдс[],  сказал он.  В крайнем доме. Там,  подтвердил мистер Дедал.  Жуткая история. Братоубийство. Так считали, по крайней мере. А Сеймур Буш его вытянул. Улик не было,  сказал мистер Пауэр. Одни косвенные,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Таков принцип правосудия. Пусть лучше девяносто девять виновных ускользнут, чем один невиновный будет приговорен[].Они смотрели. Земля убийцы. Зловеще проплыла мимо. Закрыты ставни, никто не живет, запущенный сад[]. Все пошло прахом. Невиновный приговорен.Убийство. Лицо убийцы в зрачках убитого. Про такое любят читать. В саду найдена голова мужчины. Одежда ее состояла из. Как она встретила смертный час. Знаки недавнего насилия. Орудием послужило. Убийца еще на свободе. Улики. Шнурок от ботинок. Тело решено эксгумировать. Убийство всегда откроется.Теснота тут в карете. А вдруг ей не понравится если я нежданно-негаданно. С женщинами надо поосторожней. Один раз застанешь со спущенными панталонами, всю жизнь не простит. Пятнадцать.Прутья высокой ограды Проспекта замелькали рябью в глазах. Темные тополя[], редкие белые очертания. Очертания чаще, белые силуэты толпою среди деревьев, белые очертания, части их, безмолвно скользили мимо с тщетными в воздухе застывшими жестами.Ободья скрипнули по обочине: стоп. Мартин Каннингем потянулся к ручке, нажал, повернул ее и распахнул дверцу, толкнув коленом. Он вышел. За ним мистер Пауэр и мистер Дедал.Момент переложить мыло. Рука мистера Блума проворно расстегнула задний брючный карман и отправила мыло, слипшееся с оберткой, во внутренний карман с носовым платком. Он вышел, сунув обратно газету, которую все еще держала другая рука.Убогие похороны: три кареты и катафалк. Какая разница. Факельщики, золоченая сбруя, заупокойная месса, артиллерийский салют. Смерть с помпой.У последней кареты стоял разносчик с лотком фруктов и пирожков. Черствые пирожки ссохлись вместе: пирожки для покойников. Собачья радость. Кто их ест? Те, кто обратно с кладбища.Он шел за своими спутниками, позади мистер Кернан и Нед Лэмберт, за ними Хайнс. Корни Келлехер, стоявший у открытого катафалка, взял два венка и передал один мальчику.А куда же делись те детские похороны?Упряжка лошадей со стороны Финглас-роуд натужно тащила в похоронном молчании скрипучую телегу с глыбой гранита. Шагавший впереди возчик снял шапку.Теперь гроб. Хоть мертвый, а поспел раньше[]. Лошадь оглядывается на него, султан съехал. Глаза тусклые: хомут давит, зажало ей вену или что там. А знают они что такое возят сюда каждый день? Верно что ни день похорон двадцать  тридцать. Еще Иеронимова Гора для протестантов. Хоронят везде и всюду каждую минуту по всему миру. Спихивают под землю возами, в спешном порядке. Тысячи каждый час. Чересчур много развелось.Из ворот выходили женщина и девочка в трауре. Тонкогубая гарпия, из жестких деловых баб, шляпка набок. У девочки замурзанное лицо в слезах, держит мать за руку, смотрит на нее снизу, надо или не надо плакать. Рыбье лицо, бескровное, синее[].Служители подняли гроб и понесли в ворота. Мертвый вес больше. Я сам себя чувствовал тяжелей, когда вылезал из ванны. Сначала труп: потом друзья трупа. За гробом с венками шли Корни Келлехер и мальчик. А кто это рядом с ними? Ах да, свояк.Все двигались следом.Мартин Каннингем зашептал: Я так и обомлел, когда вы при Блуме начали о самоубийствах. Что-что?  зашептал мистер Пауэр.  А почему? Его отец отравился,  шептал Мартин Каннингем.  Он был хозяин отеля Куинз в Эннисе. Слышали он сказал он едет в Клэр. Годовщина. О Господи!  шептал мистер Пауэр.  В первый раз слышу. Отравился!Он оглянулся туда, где в сторону усыпальницы кардинала двигалось лицо с темными задумчивыми глазами. Беседуя. А он был застрахован?  спросил мистер Блум. Кажется, да,  отвечал мистер Кернан,  но только он заложил свой полис. Мартин хлопочет, чтобы младшего устроить в Артейн[]. А сколько всего детишек? Пятеро. Нед Лэмберт обещает устроить одну из девочек к Тодду[]. Печальный случай,  с сочувствием произнес мистер Блум.  Пятеро маленьких детей. А какой удар для жены,  добавил мистер Кернан. Еще бы,  согласился мистер Блум.Чихала она теперь на него.Он опустил взгляд на свои начищенные ботинки. Она пережила его.Овдовела. Для нее он мертвее, чем для меня. Всегда один должен пережить другого. Мудрецы говорят. Женщин на свете больше, мужчин меньше. Выразить ей соболезнование. Ваша ужасная утрата. Надеюсь, вы вскоре последуете за ним. Это только вдовы индусов. Она может выйти за другого. За него? Нет.Хотя кто знает. Вдовство больше не в чести, как старая королева умерла[].Везли на лафете. Виктория и Альберт. Траурная церемония во Фрогморе[]. Но в конце она себе позволила парочку фиалок на шляпку. Тщеславие, в сердце сердца[]. Все ради тени. Консорт, даже не король. Ее сын, вот где было что-то реальное. Какая-то новая надежда, а не то прошлое, которое, она все ждала, вернется. Оно не может вернуться. Кому-то уйти первым  в одиночку, под землю  и не лежать уж в ее теплой постели. Как поживаете, Саймон?  тихо спросил Нед Лэмберт, пожимая руку.  Не виделись с вами целую вечность. Лучше не бывает. А что новенького в нашем преславном Корке? Я ездил туда на скачки на светлой неделе,  сказал Нед Лэмберт.  Нового одно старое. Остановился у Дика Тайви. И как там наш Дик, честняга? Как есть ничего между ним и небом,  выразился Нед Лэмберт. Силы небесные!  ахнул мистер Дедал в тихом изумлении.  Дик Тайви облысел? Мартин Каннингем пустил подписной лист в пользу ребятни,  сказал Нед Лэмберт, кивнув вперед.  По нескольку шиллингов с души. Чтобы им продержаться, пока получат страховку. Да-да,  произнес неопределенно мистер Дедал.  Это что, старший там впереди? Да,  сказал Нед Лэмберт,  и брат жены. За ними Джон Генри Ментон. Он уже подписался на фунт. Я был всегда в нем уверен,  заявил мистер Дедал.  Сколько раз я говорил Падди, чтоб он держался за ту работу. Джон Генри  это не худшее, что бывает. А как он потерял это место?  спросил Нед Лэмберт.  Попивал чересчур? Грешок многих добрых людей,  со вздохом молвил мистер Дедал.Они остановились у входа в часовню. Мистер Блум стоял позади мальчика с венком, глядя вниз на его прилизанные волосы и тонкую, с ложбинкой, шею в новеньком тесном воротничке. Бедный мальчуган! Был ли он при этом, когда отец? Оба без сознания. В последний миг приходит в себя и узнает всех в последний раз. Все что он мог бы сделать. Я должен три шиллинга ОГрэди.Понимал ли он? Служители внесли гроб в часовню. Где голова у него?Через мгновение он прошел за другими, моргая после яркого света. Гроб стоял перед алтарем на подставке, по углам четыре высокие желтые свечи.Всегда впереди нас. Корни Келлехер, прислонив венки у передних углов, знаком указал мальчику стать на колени. Вошедшие стали там и сям на колени у мест для молящихся. Мистер Блум стоял позади, невдалеке от купели, и, когда все стали на колени, аккуратно уронил из кармана развернутую газету и стал на нее правым коленом. На левое колено он осторожно поместил свою шляпу и, придерживая ее за поля, благочестиво склонил голову.Из дверей появился служка[], неся медное ведерко с чем-то внутри. За ним шел священник в белом, одной рукой поправляя столу, другой придерживая маленькую книжицу у своего жабьего брюха. А кто будет нам читать? Каркнул ворон: я опять[].Они стали у гроба, и священник принялся быстро каркать по своей книжке.Отец Гробби. Я помню, как-то похоже на гроб. []. Здоровенная морда. Заправляет спектаклем. Дюжий христианин[]. Горе тому, кто на него косо глянет: священник. Ты еси Петр.Отъел бока, как баран на клевере, сказал бы Дедал. И брюхо раздулось, как у дохлого пса. Где он такие выражения находит, диву даешься. Пуфф: бока лопаются.       , [].Дает им чувство собственной важности, когда над ними молятся по-латыни.Заупокойная месса. Все в трауре, рыдают. Бумага с траурной каймой. Твое имя в поминальном листе. Как зябко тут. Его и тянет поесть, когда сидит уныло все утро притопывает ногами да ждет следующего милости просим. И глаза жабьи. С чего его так пучит? Молли, эту с капусты. Может быть, тут воздух такой. На вид как будто раздут от газов. В таком месте должна быть адская пропасть газов. Мясников взять: сами становятся как сырые бифштексы. Кто мне рассказывал? Мервин Браун[]. В крипте святой Верберги[] у них чудный орган старинный полтораста лет им там пришлось пробуравить дырки в гробах чтобы газы выпустить и поджечь. Со свистом вырывается: синий. Свистнуло  и тебя нет.Колено больно. Ох. Вот так лучше.Священник взял из служкиного ведерка палку с шишкой на конце и помахал ей над гробом. Потом пошел в ноги гроба, помахал там. Вернулся на место и положил ее обратно в ведерко. Каким и был покуда не упокоился. Это все записано: он это все обязан проделать.      [].Служка вторил ему писклявым дискантом. Я часто думал, что лучше брать прислугу из мальчиков. Лет до пятнадцати. Старше уже, конечноА там святая вода, должно быть. Окропляет сном. Небось уже обрыдло ему махать махалкой над всеми трупами что подвозят. Пускай бы полюбовался над чем он машет. Каждый божий день свежая порция: мужчины средних лет, старухи, дети, женщины, умершие родами, бородачи, лысые бизнесмены, чахоточные девицы с цыплячьими грудками. Круглый год бормочет над ними одно и то же потом покропит водой: спите. Сейчас вот Дигнама.  [].Говорит он пойдет в рай или уже в раю. Над каждым повторяет. Нудное дело. Но что-то он должен говорить.Священник закрыл книжку и вышел, служка за ним. Корни Келлехер открыл боковые двери, и вошли могильщики. Они снова подняли гроб, вынесли его и опустили на свою каталку. Корни Келлехер дал один венок мальчику, другой свояку, и все следом за ними вышли через боковые двери на воздух, теплый и пасмурный. Мистер Блум вышел последним, сунув обратно в карман сложенную газету. Взор его оставался чинно потуплен, пока каталка с гробом не повернула налево. Железные колеса визгливо скрежетнули по гравию, и отряд тупоносых башмаков двинулся за каталкой по аллее могил.Тари тара тари тара тару. Батюшки, тут разве можно петь. Мавзолей ОКоннелла,  сказал Дедал рядом с ним.Кроткие глаза мистера Пауэра поднялись к вершине высокого обелиска. Тут он покоится,  произнес он,  среди своего народа, старый Дэн О.Но сердце его погребено в Риме[]. А сколько разбитых сердец погребено тут, Саймон! Там вон ее могила, Джек,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Скоро и я лягу рядом. Да призовет Он меня, когда будет воля Его.Не удержавшись, он начал тихо всхлипывать, бредя неровной, оступающейся походкой. Мистер Пауэр взял его под руку. Ей лучше там, где она сейчас,  мягко промолвил он. Да, я знаю,  ответил сдавленно мистер Дедал.  Она сейчас на небе, если только есть небо.Корни Келлехер шагнул в сторону и пропустил остальных вперед. Печальные события,  учтиво заговорил мистер Кернан.Мистер Блум прикрыл глаза и дважды скорбно покивал головой. Все остальные надели шляпы,  заметил мистер Кернан.  Я думаю, и нам тоже стоит. Мы последние. Это кладбище коварное место.Они покрыли головы. А вам не кажется, что его преподобие отслужил слишком скоропалительно?  сказал с неодобрением мистер Кернан.Мистер Блум солидно кивнул, глянув в живые глаза с красными прожилками.Скрытные глаза, скрытные и обыскивающие. Видимо, масон: точно не знаю.Опять рядом с ним. Мы последние. В равном положении. Авось, он что-нибудь еще скажет.Мистер Кернан добавил: Служба Ирландской Церкви[], на Иеронимовой Горе и проще и более впечатляет, я должен это сказать.Мистер Блум выразил сдержанное согласие. Язык, конечно, многое значит.Мистер Кернан торжественно произнес: Я есмь воскресение и жизнь . Это проникает до самой глубины сердца. Действительно,  сказал мистер Блум.Твоего то может и да но какой прок малому в ящике шесть футов на два с цветочком из пятки? Ему проникает? Седалище страстей. Разбитое сердце. В конечном счете насос, качает каждый день сотни галлонов крови. Потом в один прекрасный день закупорка, и ты с концами. Их тут вокруг навалом: кишки, печенки, сердца. Старые ржавые насосы -и ни черта больше.Воскресение и жизнь. Уж если умер так умер. Или идея насчет страшного суда. Всех вытряхнуть из могил. Лазарь! иди вон. А пошла вонь, и трюк провалился. Подъем! Страшный суд! И все шныряют как мыши, разыскивают свои печенки и селезенки и прочие потроха. Чтоб все до крохи собрал за утро, так твою и растак. Ползолотника праху в черепе. Двенадцать гран ползолотника. Тройская мера[].Корни Келлехер пристроился к ним. Все было экстра-класс,  сказал он.  А?Он искоса поглядел на них тягучим взглядом. Грудь полисмена. С твоим труляля труляля. Как полагается,  согласился мистер Кернан. Что? А?  переспросил Корни Келлехер.Мистер Кернан повторил. А кто это позади нас с Томом Кернаном?  спросил Джон Генри Ментон.  Лицо знакомое.Нед Лэмберт мельком оглянулся назад. Блум,  ответил он.  Мадам Мэрион Твиди, та, что была, вернее, она и есть, певица, сопрано. Это жена его. А, вон что,  протянул Джон Генри Ментон.  Давненько я ее не видал. Была эффектная женщина. Я танцевал с ней, постой-ка, тому назад пятнадцать  семнадцать золотых годиков, у Мэта Диллона в Раундтауне. Было что подержать в руках.Он оглянулся в конец процессии. А что он такое? Чем занимается? Он не был в писчебумажной торговле?Помню, я с ним расплевался как-то вечером в кегельбане.Нед Лэмберт усмехнулся: Ну как же, был. Пропагандист промокашек. Бога ради,  посетовал Джон Генри Ментон,  и что она вышла за этого гуся лапчатого? Ведь какая была, с изюминкой, с огоньком. Такой пока и осталась,  заверил Нед Лэмберт.  А он сейчас рекламный агент.Большие выпуклые глаза Джона Генри Ментона глядели неподвижно вперед.Тележка свернула в боковую аллею. Солидный мужчина выступил из засады за кустами и снял шляпу. Могильщики тронули свои кепки. Джон ОКоннелл,  сказал мистер Пауэр, довольный.  Никогда не забудет друга.Мистер ОКоннелл молча пожал всем руки. Мистер Дедал сказал: Я снова с визитом к вам. Любезный Саймон,  произнес негромко смотритель,  я совсем не желаю вас в свои завсегдатаи.Поклонившись Неду Лэмберту и Джону Генри Ментону, он пошел рядом с Мартином Каннингемом, позвякивая связкой ключей у себя за спиной. А вы не слышали историю,  спросил он у всех,  насчет Малкэхи из Кума? Я не слыхал,  ответил Мартин Каннингем.Все дружно склонили к нему цилиндры, Хайнс тоже подставил ухо.Смотритель подцепил большими пальцами золотую цепочку от часов и, деликатно понизив голос, заговорил, обращаясь к их выжидательным улыбкам: Рассказывают, будто бы двое дружков, подвыпив, в один туманный вечер заявились сюда навестить могилу приятеля. Спросили, где тут лежит Малкэхи из Кума, им объяснили, куда идти. Ну-с, проплутав сколько-то в тумане, они находят могилу. Один из пьяниц читает по буквам: Теренс Малкэхи. Другой в это время хлопает глазами на статую Спасителя, которую вдова заказала и поставила.Смотритель похлопал глазами на один из попутных памятников. Потом снова продолжал: Ну, поморгал он, поморгал на божественную статую и говорит: Да ни хрена он не похож на нашего Малкэхи. Какой-то сапожник делал, ни малейшего сходства .Вознагражденный улыбками, он пропустил их вперед и принялся тихо толковать с Корни Келлехером, забирая у него квитанции, листая и проглядывая их на ходу. Это он специально,  объяснил Мартин Каннингем Хайнсу. Знаю,  ответил Хайнс,  я раскусил. Подбодрить публику,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.  Из чистой доброты, ничего другого.Мистера Блума восхищала осанистая фигура смотрителя. С ним все хотят быть в хороших отношениях. Глубоко порядочный человек, Джон ОКоннелл, отличной выпечки. Ключи  как реклама для Ключчи  нет опасения, что кто-то сбежит, на выходе не проверяем. Хабеат корпус[]. После похорон надо заняться этой рекламой. Кажется, я написал Боллсбридж на том конверте, которым прикрыл листок, когда она вдруг вошла, а я писал Марте. Еще застрянет как неверно заадресованное. Не мешало бы побриться. Щетина седая. Это первый признак, когда волос седеет у корней. Еще характер портится. И в седых волосах уж блестит серебро[]. Интересно, что чувствует его жена. Как у него хватило духу сделать кому-то предложение. Пошли, будешь жить на кладбище. Огорошить ее этим. Сначала, может, это ее возбудит. Смерть в ухажерах. Тут всюду ночные тени роятся при таком множестве мертвецов. Тени могил когда скрипят гроба[] и Дэниэл ОКоннелл наверно он потомок его кто ж это уверял будто он был со странностями и любвеобилен на редкость но все равно великий католик как огромный гигант во тьме. Блуждающие огоньки. Могильные газы. Ей надо отвлекать мысли от этого, а то не сможет зачать. Женщины особенно впечатлительны. Рассказать ей в постели историю с привидениями, чтоб заснула. Ты видела когда-нибудь привидение? Знаешь, а я видел. Стояла тьма, хоть глаз выколи. Часы пробили двенадцать. Но могут и целоваться со всем пылом, стоит только настроить. В Турции шлюхи на кладбищах. Если взять молодую, чему угодно научится.Можешь тут подцепить молодую вдовушку. Мужчинам такое нравится. Любовь среди могил[]. Ромео. Обостряет удовольствие. В расцвете смерти объяты мы жизнью. Крайности сходятся. Танталовы муки для бедных мертвецов. Запахи жареных бифштексов для голодных. Гложущих собственные потроха. Желание подразнить других. Молли хотелось заняться любовью перед окном. Как бы там ни было, восемь детей у него.Он тут насмотрелся вдоволь на уходящих в землю, укладывает ими участок за участком вокруг. Святые поля. Больше было бы места, если хоронить стоя.Сидя или же на коленях не выйдет. Стоя[]? В один прекрасный день, оползень или что, вдруг голова показывается наружу, и протянутая рука. Тут вся земля кругом, наверное, как соты: продолговатые ячейки. Содержит все в чистоте: бордюры, трава подрезана. Майор Гэмбл[] называет Иеронимову Гору мой сад. А что, верно. Должны быть сонные цветы. Мастянский говорил, в Китае гигантские маки на кладбищах дают самый лучший опиум. Ботанический сад тут недалеко. Кровь впитывается в землю дает новую жизнь. Та же идея у тех евреев что говорят убили христианского мальчика[]. Каждому человеку своя цена. Хорошо сохранившийся жирный труп джентльмена-эпикурейца необходим для вашего сада. Цена дешевая. Туша Вильяма Уилкинсона, ревизора и бухгалтера, недавно скончавшегося, три фунта тринадцать и шесть. Рады служить вам.Можно ручаться почва тучнеет на славу от трупного удобрения, кости, мясо, ногти. Начинка склепов. Жуть. Делаются зеленые и розовые, разлагаются. В сырой земле гниют быстро. Тощие старики дольше держатся.Становятся не то сальные не то творожистые. Потом чернеют, сочатся черной вонючей патокой. Потом высыхают. Мотыльки смерти[]. Конечно клетки или что там есть живут дальше. Изменяются, но по сути вечные. Нечем кормиться кормятся собой.На них ведь должна развестись чертова погибель червей. Должно быть в почве так и кишат так и кружат. Вскрюжат голову бедняжке. Щечки в ямочках, кудряшки. А вид у него вполне бодрый. Дает ему ощущение власти, видеть как все уходят в землю раньше него. Интересно как он смотрит на жизнь. Не прочь пошутить: отвести душу. Анекдот-сообщение. Сперджен отправился на небо сегодня утром в  часа. Сейчас  вечера, время закрытия. Еще не прибыл. Петр. Мертвецы и сами по крайней мере мужчины вполне бы послушали анекдотец, а женщинам бы разузнать насчет моды. Сочную грушу или дамский пунш, крепкий, сладкий, горячий. Предохраняет от сырости. Смеяться полезно так что это самое лучшее когда в таком стиле. Могильщики в Гамлете: говорит о глубоком знании наших душ. О мертвых нельзя шутить по крайней мере два года.     []. Сначала чтобы кончился траур. Трудно представить себе его похороны. Как будто каламбур. Говорят прочесть собственный некролог будешь жить дольше. Дает второе дыхание. Новый контракт на жизнь. Сколько у нас на завтра?  спросил смотритель. Двое,  ответил Корни Келлехер.  В пол-одиннадцатого и в одиннадцать.Смотритель сунул бумаги в карман. Колеса каталки остановились.Присутствующие, разделившись, пройдя осторожно между могил, стали по обе стороны ямы. Могильщики сняли гроб и поставили его носом на край, подведя снизу веревки.Хороним его. Днесь Цезаря пришли мы хоронить[]. Его мартовские или июньские иды[]. Он не знает кто тут и ему все равно.Нет, а это-то еще кто этот долговязый раззява в макинтоше? Нет правда кто хочу знать. Нет грош я дам за то чтоб узнать. Всегда кто-нибудь объявится о ком ты отродясь не слыхивал. Человек может всю жизнь прожить в одиночестве. А что, может. Но все-таки кто-то ему нужен кто бы его зарыл хотя могилу он себе может выкопать сам. Это мы все делаем. Только человек погребает. Нет, еще муравьи. Первое что всех поражает. Хоронить мертвых.Говорят Робинзон Крузо был на самом деле. Тогда стало быть Пятница его и похоронил. Каждая Пятница хоронит четверг если так поглядеть.О бедный Крузо Робинзон,И как же смог прожить там он[]?Бедный Дигнам! Последнее земное ложе его в этом ящике. Как подумаешь сколько их кажется такой тратой дерева. Все равно сгложут. А можно было бы придумать нарядный гроб с какой-то скажем панелью чтобы с нее соскальзывали. Эх только будут возражать чтобы их хоронили в из-под другого. Страшная привередливость. Положите меня в родной земле[]. Горсточку глины из Палестины. Только мать и мертворожденного могут похоронить в одном гробу[]. А я понимаю почему. Понимаю. Чтобы его защищать как можно дольше даже в земле. Дом ирландца его гроб[]. Бальзамирование в катакомбах, мумии, тот же смысл.Мистер Блум стоял поодаль со шляпой в руках, считая обнаженные головы.Двенадцать, я тринадцатый. Нет. Чудик в макинтоше тринадцатый. Число смерти. И откуда он выскочил? В часовне не было, за это я поручусь.Глупейший предрассудок насчет тринадцати.Хороший твид, мягкий, у Неда Лэмберта на костюме. Красноватая искра. У меня был похожий когда жили на Западной Ломбард-стрит. Раньше он был большой щеголь. Три раза на день менял костюм. А мой серый надо снести к Мизайесу, чтоб перелицевал. Эге. Да он перекрашен. Надо бы его жене хотя у него нет жены или там хозяйке повыдергивать эти нитки.Гроб уходил из вида, могильщики спускали его, крепко уперев ноги на подгробных подпорах. Они выпрямились и отошли: и все обнажили головы.Двадцать.Пауза.Если бы все мы вдруг стали кем-то еще.Вдалеке проревел осел. К дождю. Не такой уж осел. Говорят, никогда не увидишь мертвого осла[]. Стыд смерти. Прячутся. Бедный папа тоже уехал[].Легкий ветерок овевал обнаженные головы, шепча. Шепот. Мальчик возле могилы держал обеими руками венок, покорно глядя в открытый черный провал.Мистер Блум стал позади осанистого и благожелательного смотрителя. Фрак хорошо пошит. Прикидывает наверно кто из нас следующий. Что ж, это долгий отдых. Ничего не чувствуешь. Только сам момент чувствуешь. Должно быть чертовски неприятно. Сперва не можешь поверить. Должно быть ошибка: это не меня. Спросите в доме напротив. Обождите, я хотел то. Я не успел это.Потом затемненная палата для смертников. Им хочется света[]. Кругом перешептываются. Вы не хотите позвать священника? Потом бессвязная речь, мысли путаются. Бред: все что ты скрывал всю жизнь. Борьба со смертью. Это у него не естественный сон. Оттяните нижнее веко. Смотрят: а нос заострился а челюсть отвисла а подошвы ног пожелтели? Заберите подушку и пусть кончается на полу все равно обречен[]. На той картинке смерть грешника ему дьявол показывает женщину. И он умирающий в рубашке тянется ее обнять.Последний акт Лючии. Ужель никогда не увижу тебя?[] Бамм! Испустил дух.Отошел наконец-то. Люди слегка поговорят о тебе  и забудут. Не забывайте молиться о нем. Поминайте его в своих молитвах. Даже Парнелл. День плюща отмирает[]. Потом и сами за ним: один за другим все в яму.Мы сейчас молимся за упокой его души. Три к носу брат и не угоди в ад.Приятная перемена климата. Со сковородки жизни в огонь чистилища.А думает он когда-нибудь про яму ждущую его самого? Говорят про это думаешь если внезапно дрожь проберет в жаркий день. Кто-то прошел по твоей могиле. Предупреждение: скоро на выход. За другими. Моя в том конце к Фингласу, участок что я купил. Мама бедная мамочка и малютка Руди.Могильщики взялись за лопаты и начали швырять на гроб тяжелые комья глины. Мистер Блум отвернул лицо. А если он все это время был жив? Брр!Вот это уж было бы ужасно! Нет, нет: он мертвый, конечно. Конечно мертвый.В понедельник умер. Надо бы какой-то закон чтобы протыкать им сердце для верности или электрический звонок в гробу или телефон и какую-нибудь решетку для доступа воздуха. Сигнал бедствия. Три дня. Летом это довольно долго. Пожалуй лучше сразу сплавлять как только уверились что не.Глина падала мягче. Начинают забывать. С глаз долой из сердца вон.Смотритель отошел в сторону и надел шляпу. С него хватит. Провожающие понемногу приободрились и неприметно, один за другим, тоже покрывали головы. Мистер Блум надел шляпу и увидел, как осанистая фигура споро прокладывает путь в лабиринте могил. Спокойно, с хозяйской уверенностью, пересекал он поля скорби[]: Хайнс что-то строчит в блокнотике. А, имена. Он же их все знает. Нет: идет ко мне. Я тут записываю имена и фамилии,  полушепотом сказал Хайнс.  Ваше как имя? Я не совсем помню. На эл,  отвечал мистер Блум.  Леопольд. И можете еще записать Маккоя. Он меня попросил. Чарли[],  произнес Хайнс, записывая.  Знаю его. Он когда-то работал во Фримене.Верно, работал, до того как устроился в морге под началом Луиса Берна.Хорошая мысль чтобы доктора делали посмертные вскрытия. Выяснить то что им кажется они и так знают. Он скончался от Вторника. Намазал пятки. Смылся, прихватив выручку с нескольких объявлений. Чарли, ты моя душка. Потому он меня и попросил. Ладно, кому от этого вред. Я все сделал, Маккой. Спасибо, старина, премного обязан. Вот и пускай будет обязан  а мне ничего не стоит. И скажите-ка,  продолжал Хайнс,  вы не знаете этого типа, ну там вон стоял, еще на немОн поискал глазами вокруг. Макинтош,  сказал мистер Блум.  Да, я его видел. Куда же он делся? Макинтош,  повторил Хайнс, записывая.  Не знаю, кто он такой. Это его фамилия?Он двинулся дальше, оглядываясь по сторонам. Да нет,  начал мистер Блум, оборачиваясь задержать его.  Нет же, Хайнс!Не слышит. А? Куда же тот испарился? Ни следа. Ну что же из всех кто.Не видали? Ка е два эл. Стал невидимкой. Господи, что с ним сталось?Седьмой могильщик подошел к мистеру Блуму взять лежавшую рядом с ним лопату. О, извините!Он поспешно посторонился.Бурая сырая глина уже видна была в яме. Она поднималась. Вровень. Гора сырых комьев росла все выше, росла, и могильщики опустили свои лопаты. На минуту все опять обнажили головы. Мальчик прислонил венок сбоку, свояк положил свой сверху. Могильщики надели кепки и понесли обглиненные лопаты к тележке. Постукали лезвием по земле: очистили. Один нагнулся и снял с черенка длинный пучок травы. Еще один отделился от товарищей и медленно побрел прочь, взяв на плечо оружие с синеблещущим лезвием. Другой в головах могилы медленно сматывал веревки, на которых спускали гроб. Его пуповина. Свояк, отвернувшись, что-то вложил в его свободную руку.Безмолвная благодарность. Сочувствуем, сэр: такое горе. Кивок. Понимаю.Вот лично вам.Участники похорон разбредались медленно, бесцельно, окольными тропками задерживались у могил прочесть имена. Давайте кругом, мимо могилы вождя[],  предложил Хайнс.  Время есть. Давайте,  сказал мистер Пауэр.Они свернули направо, следуя медленному течению своих мыслей. Тусклый голос мистера Пауэра с суеверным почтением произнес: Говорят, его вовсе и нет в могиле. Гроб был набит камнями. И что он еще вернется когда-нибудь.Хайнс покачал головой. Парнелл никогда не вернется,  сказал он.  Он там, все то, что было смертного в нем. Мир праху его.Мистер Блум шагал в одиночестве под деревьями меж опечаленных ангелов, крестов, обломанных колонн, фамильных склепов, каменных надежд, молящихся с поднятыми горе взорами, мимо старой Ирландии рук и сердец[]. Разумнее тратить эти деньги на добрые дела для живых. Молитесь за упокой души его.Как будто кто-то на самом деле. Спустили в яму и кончено. Как уголь по желобу. Потом для экономии времени за всех чохом. День поминовения.Двадцать седьмого я буду у него на могиле. Садовнику десять шиллингов.Выпалывает сорняки. Сам старик. Сгорбленный в три погибели, щелкает своими ножницами. В могиле одной ногой, Ушедший от нас. Покинувший этот мир. Как будто они по своей воле. Всех выкинули пинком. Сыгравший в ящик.Интересней, если б писали, кто они были. Имярек, колесник. Я был коммивояжер, сбывал коркский линолеум. Я выплачивал по пять шиллингов за фунт. Или женщина с кастрюлей. Я стряпала добрую ирландскую похлебку. Как там это стихотворение эклогия на сельском кладбище[] написал то ли Вордсворт то ли Томас Кемпбелл. У протестантов говорят: обрел вечный покой. Или старый доктор Моррен: великая исцелительница позвала его к себе. Для них это Божий надел[]. Очень милая загородная резиденция. Заново оштукатурена и покрашена. Идеальное местечко, чтобы спокойно покурить и почитать Черч таймс[].Объявления о свадьбах никогда не берут в веночек. Проржавелые венки, гирлянды из фольги висели на крестах и оградках. Вот это выгодней. Хотя цветы более поэтично. А такое надоедает, не вянет никогда. Совершенно невыразительно. Бессмертники.Птица неподвижно сидела на ветке тополя. Как чучело. Как наш свадебный подарок от олдермена Хупера. Кыш! Не пошевельнется. Знает, что тут не ходят с рогатками. Это еще печальней, мертвые животные. Милли-глупышка хоронила мертвую птичку в коробочке, на могилку венок из маргариток, обрывки бусиков.Это Святое Сердце там: выставлено напоказ[]. Душа нараспашку. Должно быть сбоку и раскрашено красным как настоящее сердце. Ирландия была ему посвящена или в этом роде. Выглядит страшно недовольным. За что мне такое наказание? Птицы слетались бы и клевали как там про мальчика с корзинкой плодов но он сказал нет потому что они бы испугались мальчика[]. Аполлон это был.Сколько их[]! И все когда-то разгуливали по Дублину. В бозе почившие. И мы были прежде такими, как ты теперь.И потом как можно всех запомнить? Глаза, голос, походку. Ладно, голос  положим: граммофон. Установить в каждом гробу граммофон или иметь дома.После воскресного обеда. Поставим-ка нашего бедного прадедушку. Кррааххек!Здраздрраздраст страшнорад крххек страшнорадсновавстре здраздрас стррашкррпуффс. Напоминает голос как фотография напоминает лицо. Иначе ты бы не вспомнил лицо скажем через пятнадцать лет. Чье например? Например кого-то кто умер когда я был у Уиздома Хили.Фыррст! Шорох камней. Стой. Обожди-ка.Он остановился вглядываясь в подножие склепа. Какой-то зверь. Погоди.Вон вылезает.Жирная серая крыса проковыляла вдоль стены склепа, шурша по гравию.Старый ветеран  прапрадедушка  знает все ходы-выходы. Серая живность протиснулась в щель под стену, сжавшись и извиваясь. Вот где прятать сокровища.Кто там живет? Здесь покоится Роберт Эмери[]. Роберта Эммета похоронили тут при свете факелов, так, кажется? Совершает обход.Хвост скрылся.Такие вот молодцы живо разделаются с любым. Не будут разбирать кто оставят гладкие косточки. Для них мясо и мясо. Труп это протухшее мясо. А сыр тогда что такое? Труп молока. В этих Путешествиях по Китаю[] написано что китайцы говорят от белых воняет трупом. Лучше сжигать. Попы страшно против. На руку другой фирме. Оптовая торговля кремационными и голландскими печами. Чумные поветрия. Сваливают в ямы с негашеной известкой. Камеры усыпления для животных. Прах еси и в прах возвратишься.Или хоронить в море. Где это про башню молчания у парсов[]? Птицы пожирают.Земля, огонь, вода. Говорят утонуть приятней всего. В одной вспышке видишь всю свою жизнь. А если спасли уже нет. Но в воздухе нельзя хоронить. С аэроплана. Интересно, передаются там новости когда свеженького спускают под землю. Подземные средства связи. Мы этому научились у них. Не удивился бы. Их хлеб насущный. Мухи слетаются когда еще не помер как следует.Пронюхали про Дигнама. Запах это им все равно. Рыхлая белая как соль трупная каша: на запах, на вкус как сырая репа.Ворота забелелись впереди: открыты еще. Обратно на этот свет. Довольно тут. Каждый раз приближаешься еще на шаг. Последний раз был на похоронах миссис Синико[]. И у бедного папы. Любовь которая убивает. Бывает даже разрывают землю ночью при фонарях как тот случай я читал чтоб добраться до свежезахороненной женщины или уже даже тронутой когда трупные язвы пошли.Мурашки забегают от такого. Я тебе явлюсь после смерти. Ты увидишь призрак мой после смерти. Мой призрак будет тебя преследовать после смерти.Существует тот свет после смерти и называется он ад. Мне совсем не нравится тот свет, так она написала. Мне нисколько не больше. Еще столько есть посмотреть, услышать, почувствовать. Чувствовать тепло живых существ рядом. Пускай эти спят в своих червивых постелях. В этом тайме они меня еще не возьмут. Теплые постели: теплая полнокровная жизнь.Мартин Каннингем появился из боковой аллеи, о чем-то серьезно говоря.Кажется, стряпчий. Лицо знакомое. Ментон, Джон Генри, стряпчий, поверенный по присягам и свидетельствам. Дигнам работал у него раньше. У Мэта Диллона в давние времена. Мэт компанейский человек. Веселые вечеринки. Холодная дичь, сигареты, танталовы кружки. Уж вот у кого золотое сердце. Да, Ментон. В тот вечер в кегельбане взъярился на меня как черт что я заехал своим шаром к нему. Просто по чистейшей случайности: смазал. А он меня всеми фибрами невзлюбил. Ненависть с первого взгляда.Молли и Флуи Диллон обнялись под сиренью, хихикали. Мужчины всегда так, их до смерти уязвляет если при женщинах.На шляпе у него вмятина на боку. Из кареты наверно. Прошу прощения, сэр,  сказал мистер Блум, поравнявшись с ними.Они остановились. У вас шляпа слегка помялась,  показал мистер Блум.Джон Генри Ментон одно мгновение смотрел на него в упор, не двигаясь. Тут вот,  пришел на выручку Мартин Каннингем и показал тоже.Джон Генри Ментон снял шляпу, исправил вмятину и тщательно пригладил ворс о рукав. Затем опять нахлобучил шляпу. Теперь все в порядке,  сказал Мартин Каннингем.Джон Генри Ментон отрывисто дернул головой в знак признательности. Спасибо,  бросил он кратко.Они продолжали свой путь к воротам. Мистер Блум, удрученный, отстал на несколько шагов, чтобы не подслушивать разговора. Мартин разделает этого законника. Мартин такого обалдуя обведет и выведет, пока тот не успеет рта разинуть.Рачьи глаза. Ничего. Потом еще может пожалеет когда дойдет до него. И получится твой верх.Спасибо. Ишь ты, какие мы важные с утра.Эпизод []В СЕРДЦЕ ИРЛАНДСКОЙ СТОЛИЦЫПеред колонною Нельсона[] трамваи притормаживали, меняли пути, переводили дугу, отправлялись на Блэкрок, Кингстаун и Долки, Клонски, Рэтгар и Тереньюр, Пальмерстон парк и Верхний Рэтмайнс, Сэндимаунт Грин, Рэтмайнс, Рингсенд и Сэндимаунт Тауэр, Хэролдс-кросс. Осипший диспетчер Объединенной Дублинской трамвайной компании раскрикивал их: Рэтгар и Тереньюр! Заснул, Сэндимаунт Грин!Параллельно справа и слева со звоном с лязгом одноэтажный и двухэтажный двинулись из конечных тупиков, свернули на выездную колею, заскользили параллельно. Поехал, Пальмерстон парк!ВЕНЦЕНОСЕЦУ дверей главного почтамта чистильщики зазывали и надраивали. Его Величества ярко-красные почтовые кареты, стоящие на Северной Принс-стрит, украшенные по бокам королевскими вензелями ..[], принимали с шумом швыряемые мешки с письмами, открытками, закрытками, бандеролями простыми и заказными, для рассылки в адреса местные, провинциальные, британские и заморских территорий.ПРЕДСТАВИТЕЛИ ПРЕССЫЛомовики в грубых тяжелых сапогах выкатывали с глухим стуком бочки из складов на Принс-стрит и загружали их в фургон пивоварни. В фургон пивоварни загружались бочки, с глухим стуком выкатываемые ломовиками в грубых тяжелых сапогах из складов на Принс-стрит. Вот оно,  сказал Рыжий Мерри.  Алессандро Ключчи. Вы это вырежьте, хорошо?  сказал мистер Блум,  а я захвачу в редакцию Телеграфа.Дверь кабинета Ратледжа снова скрипнула. Дэви Стивенс, малютка в огромном плаще, в маленькой мягкой шляпе, венчающей кудрявую шевелюру, проследовал со свертком бумаг под плащом, королевский гонец.Длинные ножницы Рыжего четырьмя ровными взмахами вырезали объявление из газеты. Ножницы и клей. Я сейчас зайду в типографию,  сказал мистер Блум, принимая квадратик вырезки. Разумеется, если он хочет заметку,  сказал Рыжий Мерри серьезно, с пером за ухом,  мы можем это устроить. Идет,  кивнул мистер Блум.  Я это ему втолкую.Мы.ВИЛЬЯМ БРАЙДЕН[], ЭСКВАЙР, ОКЛЕНД, СЭНДИМАУНТРыжий Мерри тронул рукав мистера Блума своими ножницами и шепнул: Брайден.Мистер Блум обернулся и увидал, как швейцар в ливрее приподнял литерную фуражку при появлении величественной фигуры, что, войдя, двинулась между щитами газет Уикли фримен энд нэшнл пресс и Фрименс джорнэл энд нэшнл пресс. Глухое громыхание пивных бочек. Она прошествовала величественно по лестнице, зонтом себе указуя путь, с лицом недвижноважным, брадообрамленным. Спина в тонких сукнах возносилась с каждой ступенью выше: спина. У него все мозги в затылке, уверяет Саймон Дедал. Плоть складками обвисала сзади. Жирные складки шеи, жир, шея, жир, шея. Вам не кажется, что у него лицо напоминает Спасителя?  шепнул Рыжий-Мерри.И дверь кабинета Ратледжа шепнула: скрип-скрип. Вечно поставят двери напротив одна другой чтобы ветру. Дуй сюда. Дуй отсюда.Спаситель: брадообрамленный овал лица; беседа в вечерних сумерках.Мария, Марфа. За путеводным зонтом-мечом к рампе: Марио, тенор[]. Или Марио,  сказал мистер Блум. Да,  согласился Рыжий Мерри.  Но всегда говорили, что Марио  вылитый Спаситель.Иисус Марио с нарумяненными щеками, в камзоле и тонконогий. Прижал руку к сердцу. В Марте[].Ве е-рнись моя утрата, Ве-е-рнись моя любовь.ПОСОХ И ПЕРО Его преосвященство звонили дважды за это утро,  сказал Рыжий Мерри почтительно.Они смотрели как исчезают из глаз колени, ноги, башмаки. Шея.Влетел мальчишка, разносчик телеграмм, кинул пакет на стойку, вылетел с телеграфной скоростью, бросив лишь слово: "Фримен"!Мистер Блум неторопливо проговорил: Что же, ведь он действительно один из наших спасителей.Кроткая улыбка сопутствовала ему, когда он поднимал крышку стойки и когда выходил в боковые двери и шел темной и теплой лестницей и потом по проходу по доскам, уже совсем расшатавшимся. Спасет ли он однако тираж газеты? Стук. Стук машин.Он толкнул створки застекленных дверей и вошел, переступив через ворох упаковочной бумаги. Пройдя меж лязгающих машин, он проследовал за перегородку, где стоял письменный стол Наннетти[].С ГЛУБОКИМ ПРИСКОРБИЕМ СООБЩАЕМ О КОНЧИНЕ ВЫСОКОЧТИМОГО ГРАЖДАНИНА ДУБЛИНАХайнс тоже тут: сообщение о похоронах наверно. Стук. Перестук.Сегодня утром прах опочившего мистера Патрика Дигнама. Машины.Перемелют человека на атомы если попадется туда. Правят миром сегодня. И его машинерия тоже трудится. Как эти, вышла из подчинения: забродило.Пошло вразнос, рвется вон. А та серая крыса старая рвется чтоб пролезть внутрь.КАК ВЫПУСКАЕТСЯ КРУПНЕЙШАЯ ЕЖЕДНЕВНАЯ ГАЗЕТАМистер Блум остановился за спиной щупловатого фактора, дивясь гладкоблестящей макушке.Странно, он никогда не видал своей настоящей родины. Моя родина Ирландия. Избран от Колледж Грин. Выпячивал как мог что он работяга на полном рабочем дне. Еженедельник берут из-за реклам, объявлений, развлекательных пустячков, а не протухших новостей из официоза. Королева Анна скончалась[]. Опубликовано властями в тыща таком-то году. Поместье расположено в округе Розеналлис, баронские владения Тинначинч. Для всех заинтересованных лиц согласно установлениям приводим сведения о числе мулов и лошадей испанской породы, запроданных на экспорт в Баллине.Заметки о природе. Карикатуры. Очередная история Фила Блейка из серии про быка и Пэта. Страничка для малышей, сказки дядюшки Тоби. Вопросы деревенского простака. Господин Уважаемый Редактор, какое лучшее средство, когда пучит живот? В этом отделе я бы хотел, пожалуй. Уча других, кой-чему сам научишься. Светская хроника. К.О.К[]. Кругом одни картинки. Стройные купальщицы на золотом пляже. Самый большой воздушный шар в мире. Двойной праздник: общая свадьба у двух сестер. Два жениха глядят друг на дружку и хохочут. Купрани, печатник, он ведь тоже. Ирландец больше чем сами ирландцы.Машины лязгали на счет три-четыре. Стук-стук-стук. А положим, вдруг у него удар и никто их не умеет остановить, тогда так и будут без конца лязгать и лязгать, печатать и печатать, туда-сюда, взад-вперед. Мартышкин труд. Тут надо хладнокровие. Давайте пустим это в вечерний выпуск, советник,  сказал Хайнс.Скоро начнет его называть лорд-мэр. Говорят, Длинный Джон[] покровительствует ему.Фактор молча нацарапал печатать в углу листа и сделал знак наборщику.Все так же без единого слова он передал листок за грязную стеклянную перегородку. Прекрасно, благодарю,  сказал Хайнс и повернулся идти.Мистер Блум преграждал ему путь. Если хотите получить деньги, то имейте в виду, кассир как раз уходит обедать,  сказал он, указывая себе за спину большим пальцем. А вы уже?  спросил Хайнс. Гм,  промычал мистер Блум.  Если вы поспешите, еще поймаете его. Спасибо, дружище,  сказал Хайнс.  Пойду и я его потрясу.И он энергично устремился к редакции Фрименс джорнэл.Три шиллинга я ему одолжил у Маэра. Три недели прошло. И третий раз намекаю.МЫ ВИДИМ РЕКЛАМНОГО АГЕНТА ЗА РАБОТОЙМистер Блум положил свою вырезку на стол мистера Наннетти. Прошу прощения, советник,  сказал он.  Вот эта реклама, вы помните, для Ключчи.Мистер Наннетти поглядел на вырезку и кивнул. Он хочет, чтобы поместили в июле,  продолжал мистер Блум.Не слышит. Наннан. Железные нервы.Фактор наставил свой карандаш. Минутку,  сказал мистер Блум,  он бы кое-что хотел изменить.Понимаете, Ключчи. И он хочет два ключа наверху.Адский грохот. Может он понимает что я.Фактор повернулся, готовый выслушать терпеливо, и, подняв локоть, не спеша принялся почесывать под мышкой своего альпакового пиждака. Вот так,  показал мистер Блум, скрестив указательные пальцы наверху.Пускай до него сначала дойдет.Мистер Блум, поглядев вверх и наискось от устроенного им креста, увидел землистое лицо фактора, похоже у него легкая желтуха, а за ним послушные барабаны, пожирающие нескончаемые ленты бумаги. Лязг. Лязг. Мили и мили ненамотанной. А что с ней будет потом? Ну, мало ли: мясо заворачивать, делать кульки: тысячу применений найдут.Проворно вставляя слова в паузы между лязганьем, он быстро начал чертить на исцарапанном столе.ДОМ КЛЮЧ(Ч)ЕЙ[] Вот так, видите. Тут два скрещенных ключа. И круг. А потом имя и фамилия, Алессандро Ключчи, торговля чаем и алкогольными напитками. Ну, и прочее.В его деле лучше его не учить. Вы сами представляете, советник, что ему требуется. И потом наверху по кругу вразрядку: дом ключей. Понимаете? Как ваше мнение, это удачная мысль?Фактор опустил руку ниже и теперь молча почесывал у нижних ребер. Суть идеи,  пояснил мистер Блум,  это дом ключей. Вы же знаете, советник, парламент острова Мэн. Легкий намек на гомруль. Туристы, знаете ли, с острова Мэн. Сразу бросается в глаза. Можете вы так сделать?Пожалуй можно бы у него спросить как произносится это . Ну а вдруг не знает тогда выходит поставлю в неудобное положение. Не будем. Это мы можем,  сказал фактор.  У вас есть эскиз? Я принесу,  заверил мистер Блум.  Это уже печатала газета в Килкенни. У него и там торговля. Сейчас сбегаю и попрошу у него. Стало быть, вы сделайте это и еще коротенькую заметку, чтобы привлечь внимание.Знаете, как обычно. Торговый патент, высокое качество. Давно ощущается необходимость. Ну, и прочее.Фактор подумал минуту. Это мы можем,  повторил он.  Только пускай он закажет на три месяца.Наборщик поднес ему влажный лист верстки, и он молча принялся править.Мистер Блум стоял возле, слушая, как скрипуче вращаются валы, и глядя на наборщиков, склонившихся в молчанье над кассами.НА ТЕМУ ПРАВОПИСАНИЯДолжен все назубок знать как пишется. Охота за опечатками. Мартин Каннингем утром забыл нам дать свой головоломный диктант на правописание.Забавно наблюдать бес а не без прецеде перед дэ эн не ставим нтное изумление уличного разносчика через эсче внезапно оценившего башмаком изысканную тут два эн симме а тут двойное эм, верно? трию сочного грушевого плода заблаговременно в середине о а не а оставленного неизвестным после эс надо тэ доброжелателем у врат некрополя. Нелепо накручено, правда же?Надо мне было сказать что-то когда он напяливал свой цилиндр. Спасибо.Сказать насчет старой шляпы или что-то этакое. Нет. Можно было сказать.Смотрится почти как новая. Поглядеть бы на его физию в этот момент.У ух. Нижний талер ближайшей машины выдвинул вперед доску с первой -у-ух  пачкой сфальцованной бумаги. У-ух. Почти как живая ухает чтоб обратили внимание. Изо всех сил старается заговорить. И та дверь тоже  у-ух  поскрипывает, просит, чтобы прикрыли. Все сущее говорит, только на свой манер. У-ух.ИЗВЕСТНЫЙ ЦЕРКОВНОСЛУЖИТЕЛЬ В РОЛИ КОРРЕСПОНДЕНТАНеожиданно фактор протянул оттиск назад, со словами: Погоди. А где же письмо архиепископа? Его надо перепечатать в Телеграфе. Где этот, как его?Он обвел взглядом свои шумные, но не дающие ответа машины. Монкс, сэр?  спросил голос из словолитни. Ну да. Где Монкс? Монкс!Мистер Блум взял свою вырезку. Пора уходить. Так я принесу эскиз, мистер Наннетти,  сказал он,  и я уверен, вы дадите это на видном месте. Монкс! Да, сэр.Заказ на три месяца. Это надо сперва обдумать на свежую голову. Но попробовать можно. Распишу про август: прекрасная мысль: месяц конной выставки. Боллсбридж[]. Туристы съедутся на выставку.СТАРОСТА ДНЕВНОЙ СМЕНЫОн прошел через наборный цех мимо согбенного старца в фартуке и в очках. Старина Монкс, староста дневной смены. Какой только дребедени не прошло у него через руки за долгую службу: некрологи, трактирные рекламы, речи, бракоразводные тяжбы, обнаружен утопленник. Подходит уж к концу своих сроков. Человек непьющий, серьезный, и с недурным счетом в банке, я полагаю. Жена отменно готовит и стирает. Дочка швея, работает в ателье.Простая девушка, безо всяких фокусов.И БЫЛ ПРАЗДНИК ПАСХИОн приостановился поглядеть, как ловко наборщик верстает текст. Сначала читает его справа налево. Да как быстро, мангиД киртаП. Бедный папа читает мне бывало свою Хаггаду[] справа налево, водит пальцем по строчкам, Пессах.Через год в Иерусалиме. О Боже, Боже! Вся эта длинная история об исходе из земли Египетской и в дом рабства аллилуйя. Шема Исраэл Адонаи Элоим. Нет, это другая. Потом о двенадцати братьях, сыновьях Иакова. И потом ягненок и кошка и собака и палка и вода и мясник. А потом ангел смерти убивает мясника а тот убивает быка а собака убивает кошку. Кажется чепухой пока не вдумаешься как следует. По смыслу здесь правосудие а на поверку о том как каждый пожирает всех кого может. В конечном счете, такова и есть жизнь. Но до чего же он быстро. Отработано до совершенства. Пальцы как будто зрячие.Мистер Блум выбрался из лязга и грохота, пройдя галереей к площадке. И что, тащиться в эту даль на трамвае, а его, может, и не застанешь? Лучше сначала позвонить. Какой у него номер? Да. Как номер дома Цитрона.Двадцатьвосемь. Двадцатьвосемь и две четверки.ОПЯТЬ ЭТО МЫЛООн спустился по лестнице. Кой дьявол тут исчиркал все стены спичками?Как будто на спор старались. И всегда в этих заведениях спертый тяжелый дух. Когда у Тома работал  от неостывшего клея в соседней комнате.Он вынул платок, чтобы прикрыть нос. Цитрон-лимон? Ах, да, у меня же там мыло. Оттуда может и потеряться. Засунув платок обратно, он вынул мыло и упрятал в брючный карман. Карман застегнул на пуговицу.Какими духами душится твоя жена? Еще можно сейчас поехать домой  трамваем  мол забыл что-то. Повидать и все  до этого  за одеванием.Нет. Спокойствие. Нет.Из редакции Ивнинг телеграф вдруг донесся визгливый хохот. Ясно кто это. Что там у них? Зайду на минутку позвонить. Нед Лэмберт, вот это кто.Он тихонько вошел.ЭРИН, ЗЕЛЕНЫЙ САМОЦВЕТ В СЕРЕБРЯНОЙ ОПРАВЕ МОРЯ[] Входит призрак,  тихонько прошамкал запыленному окну профессор Макхью полным печенья ртом.Мистер Дедал, переводя взгляд от пустого камина на ухмыляющуюся физиономию Неда Лэмберта, скептически ее вопросил: Страсти Христовы, неужели у вас от этого не началась бы изжога в заднице?А Нед Лэмберт, усевшись на столе, продолжал читать вслух: Или обратим взор на извивы говорливого ручейка, что, журча и пенясь, враждует с каменистыми препонами на своем пути к бурливым водам голубых владений Нептуна и струится меж мшистых берегов, овеваемый нежными зефирами, покрытый то играющими бляшками света солнца, то мягкою тенью, отбрасываемой на его задумчивое лоно высоким пологом роскошной листвы лесных великанов . Ну, каково, Саймон?  спросил он поверх газеты.  Как вам высокий стиль? Смешивает напитки,  выразился мистер Дедал.Нед Лэмберт хлопнул себя газетою по коленке и, заливаясь хохотом, повторил: Играющие бляхи и задумчивое лоно. Ну, братцы! Ну, братцы! И Ксенофонт смотрел на Марафон,  произнес мистер Дедал, вновь бросив взгляд на нишу камина и оттуда к окну,  и Марафон смотрел на море[]. Хватит уже,  закричал от окна профессор Макхью.  Не желаю больше выслушивать этот вздор.Прикончив ломтик-полумесяц постного печенья, которое непрерывно грыз, он тут же, оголодалый, собрался перейти к следующему, уже заготовленному в другой руке.Высокопарный вздор. Трепачи. Как видим, Нед Лэмберт взял выходной.Все таки похороны, это как-то выбивает из колеи на весь день. Говорят, он пользуется влиянием. Старый Чаттертон[], вице-канцлер, ему двоюродный то ли дедушка, то ли прадедушка. Говорят, уж под девяносто. Небось и некролог на первую полосу давно заготовлен. А он живет им назло. Еще как бы самому не пришлось первым. Джонни, ну-ка уступи место дядюшке. Достопочтенному Хеджесу Эйру Чаттертону. Я так думаю по первым числам он ему выписывает иногда чек а то и парочку дрожащей рукой. То-то будет подарок когда он протянет ноги. Аллилуйя. Очередные потуги,  сказал Нед Лэмберт. А что это такое?  спросил мистер Блум. Вновь найденный недавно фрагмент Цицерона,  произнес профессор Макхью торжественным голосом.  Наша любимая отчизна .КОРОТКО, НО МЕТКО Чья отчизна?  спросил бесхитростно мистер Блум. Весьма уместный вопрос,  сказал профессор, не прекращая жевать.  С ударением на чья. Отчизна Дэна Доусона,  промолвил мистер Дедал. Это его речь вчера вечером?  спросил мистер Блум.Нед Лэмберт кивнул. Да вы послушайте,  сказал он.Дверная ручка пихнула мистера Блума в поясницу: дверь отворяли. Прошу прощения,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, входя.Мистер Блум поспешно посторонился. А я у вас,  сказал он. Привет, Джек. Заходите, заходите. Приветствую. Как поживаете, Дедал? Жить можно. А вы?Дж.Дж.ОМоллой пожал плечами.ПРИСКОРБНОРаньше был самый способный из молодых адвокатов. Скатился, бедняга.Этот чахоточный румянец вернейший признак что песенка спета. Теперь только прощальный поцелуй. Интересно, с чем он пожаловал. Трудности с деньгами. Или задумаем достигнуть горных вершин, сомкнувшихся мощным строем . Вид у вас просто люкс. А редактора можно сейчас увидеть?  спросил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, кивая в сторону другой двери. Сколько угодно,  сказал профессор Макхью.  Не только увидеть, но и услышать. Он с Ленеханом[] в своем святилище.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой не спеша подошел к конторке с подшивкой газеты и начал перелистывать розовые страницы.Практика захирела. Неудачник. Падает духом. Азартные игры. Долги под честное слово. Пожинает бурю. А раньше имел солидные гонорары от Д. и Т.Фицджеральдов. В париках, чтоб показать серое вещество. Мозги выставлены наружу как сердце у той статуи в Гласневине. Кажется, он пописывает какие-то вещицы для Экспресса вместе с Габриэлом Конроем[]. Неплохо начитан. Майлс Кроуфорд начинал в Индепенденте. Просто смешно как эти газетчики готовы вилять, едва почуют что ветер в другую сторону. Флюгера.И нашим и вашим, не поймешь чему верить. Любая басня хороша, пока не расскажут следующую. На чем свет грызутся друг с другом в своих газетах, и вдруг все лопается как мыльный пузырь. И на другое утро уже друзья-приятели. Нет, вы послушайте, послушайте,  взмолился Нед Лэмберт.  Или задумаем достигнуть горных вершин, сомкнувшихся мощным строем  Пустозвонит!  вмешался профессор с раздражением.  Довольно нам этого надутого болтуна! Строем ,  продолжал Нед Лэмберт,  уходящих все выше в небо, дабы словно омыть наши души  Лучше омыл бы глотку,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Господи, Твоя воля!Ну? И за этакое еще платят? Души бесподобною панорамой истинных сокровищ Ирландии, непревзойденных, несмотря на множество хваленых подобий в иных шумно превозносимых краях, по красоте своих тенистых рощ, оживляемых холмами долин и сочных пастбищ, полных весеннею зеленью, погруженной в задумчивое мерцание наших мягких таинственных ирландских сумерек ЕГО РОДНОЕ НАРЕЧИЕ Луна,  сказал профессор Макхью.  Он забыл Гамлета[]. Застилающих вид вдаль и вширь, покуда мерцающий диск луны не воссияет, расточая повсюду свое лучезарное серебро  Ох!  воскликнул мистер Дедал, испустив безнадежный стон.  Ну и дерьмо собачье! С нас уже хватит, Нед. Жизнь и так коротка.Он снял цилиндр и, раздувая в нетерпении густые усы, причесался по валлийскому способу: растопыренной пятерней.Нед Лэмберт отложил газету, довольно посмеиваясь. Через мгновение резкий лающий смех сотряс небритое и в темных очках лицо профессора Макхью. Сдобный Доу!  воскликнул он.КАК ГОВАРИВАЛ ВЕЗЕРАП[]Язвить можно конечно но публика-то это хватает как горячие пирожки.Кстати он кажется сам из булочников? А то с чего его зовут Сдобный Доу. Но кто бы ни был гнездышко он себе устроил недурно. У дочки жених в налоговом управлении, имеет автомобиль. Ловко подцепила его. Приемы, открытый дом.Угощение до отвала. Везерап всегда это говорил. Проводи захват через брюхо.Дверь, ведущая в кабинет, распахнулась резким толчком, и в комнату вдвинулась красноклювая физиономия, увенчанная хохлом торчащих как перья волос. Дерзкие голубые глаза оглядели присутствующих, и резкий голос спросил: Что тут происходит? И вот он, собственною персоной, самозваный помещик[],  торжественно объявил профессор Макхью. Анепошелбыты, жалкий преподавателишка!  выразил редактор свою признательность. Пойдемте, Нед,  сказал мистер Дедал, надевая шляпу.  После такого мне надо выпить. Выпить!  вскричал редактор.  Перед мессой спиртного не подают. Что верно, то верно,  отвечал мистер Дедал, уже выходя.  Пойдемте, Нед.Нед Лэмберт боком соскользнул со стола. Голубые глаза редактора, блуждая, остановились на лице мистера Блума, осененном улыбкой. А вы не присоединитесь, Майлс?  спросил Нед Лэмберт.ВОСПОМИНАНИЯ О ДОСТОПАМЯТНЫХ БИТВАХ Ополчение Северного Корка[]!  вскричал редактор, устремляясь к камину. Мы всегда побеждали! Северный Корк и испанские офицеры! А где это было, Майлс?  спросил Нед Лэмберт, задумчиво разглядывая носки своих башмаков. В Огайо!  крикнул редактор. Там все и было, готов божиться,  согласился Нед Лэмберт.По пути к выходу он шепнул ОМоллою: Начало белой горячки. Печальный случай. Огайо!  кричал редактор петушиным дискантом задрав багровое лицо вверх.  Мой край Огайо! Образцовый кретик[]!  заметил профессор.  Долгий, краткий и долгий.О, ЭОЛОВА АРФАОн достал из жилетного кармана катушку нитки для зубов и, оторвав кусок, ловко натянул его как струну между двумя парами своих нечищеных звучных зубов. Бинг-бэнг. Бэнг-бэнг.Мистер Блум, увидав берег чистым, направился к двери кабинета. Я на минуту, мистер Кроуфорд,  сказал он.  Мне только позвонить насчет одного объявления.Он вошел. А как с передовицей для вечернего выпуска?  спросил профессор Макхью, подойдя к редактору и веско положив руку ему на плечо. Все будет в порядке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд уже несколько спокойней. Можешь не волноваться. Привет, Джек. Тут все в порядке. Здравствуйте, Майлс,  произнес Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, выпуская из рук страницы, мягко скользнувшие к остальной подшивке.  Скажите, это дело о канадском мошенничестве  сегодня[]?В кабинете зажужжал телефон. Двадцать восемь Нет, двадцать Сорок четыре Да.УГАДАЙТЕ ПОБЕДИТЕЛЯЛенехан появился из внутренних помещений с листками бюллетеней Спорта о скачках. Кто хочет верняка на Золотой Кубок?  спросил он.  Корона, жокей ОМэдден.Он бросил листки на стол.Крики и топот босоногих мальчишек-газетчиков, доносившиеся из вестибюля, внезапно приблизились, и дверь распахнулась настежь. Тсс,  произнес Ленехан.  Слышится чья-то пустопь.Профессор Макхью пересек комнату и ухватил съежившегося мальчишку за шиворот, а остальные врассыпную бросились наутек из вестибюля и вниз по лестнице. Сквозняк с мягким шелестом подхватил листки, и они, описав голубые закорючки в воздухе, приземлились под столом. Я не виноват, сэр. Это тот длинный меня впихнул, сэр. Да вышвырни его и закрой ту дверь,  сказал редактор.  А то целый ураган поднялся.Ленехан, нагибаясь и покряхтывая, начал подбирать листки с пола. Мы ждали специального о скачках, сэр,  сказал мальчишка.  Это Пэт Фаррел меня впихнул, сэр.Он указал на две рожицы, заглядывающие в дверную щель. Вон тот, сэр. Ладно, проваливай,  сердито скомандовал профессор Макхью.Он вытолкал мальчишку и крепко захлопнул дверь.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой шелестел подшивкой, что-то отыскивая и бормоча: Продолжение на шестой странице, четвертый столбец. Да, это из редакции Ивнинг телеграф,  говорил мистер Блум по телефону из кабинета.  А хозяин? Да, Телеграф Куда? Ага! На каком аукционе? Ага! Ясно. Хорошо. Я найду его.ПРОИСХОДИТ СТОЛКНОВЕНИЕКогда он положил трубку, телефон снова зажужжал. Он быстро вошел и натолкнулся прямо на Ленехана, боровшегося со вторым листочком. Пардон, месье,  сказал Ленехан, на миг ухватившись за него и скорчив гримасу. Это я виноват,  отвечал мистер Блум, покорно перенося цепкий зажим. Я не ушиб вас? Я очень спешу. Колено,  пожаловался Ленехан.Он сделал смешную мину и захныкал, потирая колено: Ох, набирается годиков нашей эры. Прошу прощения,  сказал мистер Блум.Он подошел к двери и, взявшись уже за ручку, немного помедлил.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой захлопнул тяжелую подшивку. В пустом вестибюле эхом отдавались звуки губной гармошки и двух пронзительных голосов мальчишек, усевшихся на ступеньках:Мы вексфордские парниВ сраженье храбрецы[].БЛУМ УХОДИТ Я должен бежать на Бэйчлорз-уок,  объяснил мистер Блум,  насчет этой рекламы для Ключчи. Надо договориться окончательно. Мне сказали, что он там рядом, у Диллона.Какой то миг он смотрел на них в нерешительности. Редактор, который облокотился на каминную полку, подперев голову рукой, внезапно широким жестом простер руку вперед. Гряди!  возгласил он.  Перед тобою весь мир[].Дж.Дж.ОМоллой взял листки у Ленехана из рук и начал читать, осторожными дуновениями отделяя их друг от друга, не говоря ни слова. Он устроит эту рекламу,  сказал профессор, глядя через очки в черной оправе поверх занавески.  Полюбуйтесь, как эти юные бездельники за ним увязались. Где? Покажите!  закричал Ленехан, подбегая к окну.УЛИЧНОЕ ШЕСТВИЕОба посмеялись, глядя поверх занавески на мальчишек, которые выплясывали гуськом за мистером Блумом, а у последнего белыми зигзагами мотался под ветром шутовской змей с белыми бантиками по хвосту. Поглядеть на свистопляску этих разбойников,  объявил Ленехан,  и тут же загнешься. Ох, пуп с потехи вспотел! Подхватили, как тот вышагивает своими плоскостопыми лапищами. Мелкие бесенята. Подметки на ходу режут.Вдруг с резвостью он принялся карикатурить мазурку, через всю комнату, мимо камина скольженьями устремляясь к ОМоллою, который опустил листки в готовно протянутые его руки. Что это здесь?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд, словно очнувшись.  А где остальные двое? Кто?  обернулся профессор.  Они отправились в Овал малость выпить.Там Падди Хупер, а с ним Джек Холл[]. Приехали вчера вечером. Пошли, раз так,  решил Майлс Кроуфорд.  Где моя шляпа?Дергающейся походкой он прошел в кабинет, отводя полы пиджака и звеня ключами в заднем кармане. Потом ключи звякнули на весу, потом об дерево, когда он запирал свой стол. А он явно уже хорош,  сказал вполголоса профессор Макхью. Кажется, да,  раздумчиво пробормотал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой, вынимая свой портсигар.  Но знаете, то, что кажется, не всегда верно. Кто самый богатый спичками?ТРУБКА МИРАОн предложил сигареты профессору, взял сам одну. Ленехан чиркнул проворно спичкой и дал им по очереди прикурить. Дж.Дж.ОМоллой снова раскрыл портсигар и протянул ему. Мерсибо,  сказал Ленехан, беря сигарету.Редактор вышел из кабинета в соломенной шляпе, криво надвинутой на лоб.Продекламировал нараспев, тыча сурово пальцем в профессора Макхью:Да, мощь и слава завлекли тебя,Империя твое пленила сердце[].Профессор усмехнулся, не разомкнув своих длинных губ. Ну, что? Эх, ты, несчастная Римская Империя!  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара. Ленехан тут же гибким движением поднес ему прикурить и сказал: Прошу помолчать. Моя новейшая загадка!  ,  произнес негромко Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Это звучит куда благородней чем британская или брикстонская[]. Слова чем-то напоминают про масло, подливаемое в огонь.Майлс Кроуфорд мощно выпустил в потолок первую струю дыма. Это точно,  сказал он.  Мы и есть масло. Вы и я  масло в огонь. И шансов у нас еще меньше чем у снежного кома в адском пекле.ВЕЛИЧИЕ, ЧЬЕ ИМЯ  РИМ[] Одну минуту,  сказал профессор Макхью, подняв два спокойных когтя.  Не следует поддаваться словам, звучанию слов. Мы думаем о Риме имперском, императорском, императивном[].Он сделал паузу и ораторски простер руки, вылезающие из обтрепанных и грязных манжет: Но какова была их цивилизация? Бескрайна, согласен: но и бездушна. : сточные канавы. Евреи в пустыне или на вершине горы говорили: Отрадно быть здесь. Поставим жертвенник Иегове[]. А римлянин, как и англичанин, следующий по его стопам, приносил с собою на любой новый берег, куда ступала его нога (на наш берег она никогда не ступала[]), одну лишь одержимость клоакой[]. Стоя в своей тоге, он озирался кругом и говорил: Отрадно быть здесь. Соорудим же ватерклозет . Каковой неукоснительно и сооружали,  сказал Ленехан.  Наши древние далекие предки, как можно прочесть в первой главе книги Пития, имели пристрастие к проточной воде. Они были достойными детьми природы,  тихо сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Но у нас есть и римское право. И Понтий Пилат пророк его,  откликнулся профессор Макхью. А вы слышали историю про первого лорда казначейства Поллса?  спросил ОМоллой.  Был парадный обед в королевском университете. Все шло как по маслу Сначала отгадайте загадку,  прервал Ленехан.  Как, готовы?Из вестибюля появился мистер ОМэдден Берк[], высокий, в просторном сером донегальского твида. За ним следовал Стивен Дедал, снимая на ходу шляпу. ,  []!  закричал Ленехан. Я сопровождаю просителя,  произнес благозвучно мистер ОМэдден Берк. Юность, ведомая Опытом, наносит визит Молве. Как поживаете?  сказал редактор, протянув руку.  Заходите. Родитель ваш отбыл только что.Ленехан объявил всем: Внимание! Какая опера страдает хромотой? Думайте, напрягайтесь, соображайте и отвечайте.Стивен протянул отпечатанные на машинке листки, указывая на заголовок и подпись. Кто?  спросил редактор.Край то оторван. Мистер Гэррет Дизи,  ответил Стивен. Старый бродяга,  сказал редактор.  А оторвал кто? Приспичило ему, что ли.Приплыв сквозь бури Сквозь пены клубы Вампир бледнолицый Мне губы впил в губы. Здравствуйте, Стивен,  сказал профессор, подойдя к ним и заглядывая через плечо.  Ящур? Вы что, стали?Быколюбивым бардом.СКАНДАЛ В ФЕШЕНЕБЕЛЬНОМ РЕСТОРАНЕ Здравствуйте, сэр,  отвечал Стивен, краснея.  Это не мое письмо.Мистер Гэррет Дизи меня попросил Знаю, знаю его,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд,  да и жену знавал тоже.Мерзейшая старая карга, какую свет видывал. Вот у нее уж точно был ящур, клянусь Христом! Вспомнить тот вечер, когда она суп выплеснула прямо в лицо официанту в Звезде и Подвязке. Ого-го!Женщина принесла грех в мир. Из-за Елены, сбежавшей от Менелая, греки десять лет. ОРурк, принц Брефни. Он что, вдовец?  спросил Стивен. Ага, соломенный,  отвечал Майлс Кроуфорд, пробегая глазами машинопись.  Императорские конюшни. Габсбург. Ирландец спас ему жизнь на крепостном валу в Вене[]. Не забывайте об этом! Максимилиан Карл ОДоннелл, граф фон Тирконнелл в Ирландии. Сейчас он отправил своего наследника и тот привез королю титул австрийского фельдмаршала. Когда-нибудь будет там заваруха! Дикие гуси. О да, всякий раз. Не забывайте об этом! Забыл ли об этом он, вот вопрос?  тихо произнес ОМоллой, вертя в руках пресс-папье в форме подковы.  Спасать государей  неблагодарное занятие.Профессор Макхью обернулся к нему. А если нет?  спросил он. Я расскажу вам, как было дело,  начал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Как-то раз один венгр[]ОБРЕЧЕННЫЕ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯ. УПОМИНАНИЕ О БЛАГОРОДНОМ МАРКИЗЕ Мы всегда оставались верны обреченным предприятиям,  сказал профессор.  Успех означает для нас гибель разума и воображения. Мы никогда не хранили верность преуспевающим. Мы им прислуживаем. Я преподаю назойливую латынь. Я говорю на языке расы, у которой вершина мышления это афоризм: время  деньги. Материальное господство. ! Господин! А где же духовное? Господь Иисус? Господин Солсбери[]? Диван в клубе в Уэст-Энде.Но греки!КЮРИЕ ЭЛЕЙСОН[]!Светлая улыбка оживила его темнооправленные глаза, еще больше растянула длинные губы. Греки!  повторил он.  Кюриос ! Сияющее слово! Гласные, которых не знают семиты и саксы[]. Кюрие ! Лучезарность разума. Мне бы следовало преподавать греческий, язык интеллекта. Кюрие элейсон ! Строителям клозетов и клоак никогда не быть господами нашего духа. Мы наследники католического рыцарства Европы[], которое пошло ко дну при Трафальгаре, и царства духа  а это вам не ,  которое потонуло вместе с флотом афинян при Эгоспотамах[]. Да-да. Они потонули. Пирр, обманутый оракулом, совершил последнюю попытку повернуть судьбы Греции[]. Верный обреченному предприятию.Он отошел к окну. Они выходили на бой,  продекламировал мистер ОМэдден Берк тусклым голосом,  и гибли они неизменно[]. У-у! Ох-хо-хо!  негромко взрыдал Ленехан.  Получил кирпичом в самом конце представления. Бедняга, о бедняга, бедняга Пирр!Потом он стал нашептывать в ухо Стивену:ЛИМЕРИК ЛЕНЕХАНАВот ученый профессор из Дублина.Протирает очки он насупленно. Но успел он напиться, И в глазах все двоится, Так что труд его  даром погубленный.В трауре по Саллюстию[], как выражается Маллиган. У которого мамаша подохла.Майлс Кроуфорд сунул листки в карман. Ладно, пойдет,  сказал он.  Остальное потом прочту. Все будет в порядке.Ленехан протестующе замахал руками. А как же моя загадка?  сказал он.  Какая опера страдает хромотой? Опера?  сфинксоподобное лицо мистера ОМэддена Берка еще более озагадочилось.Ленехан объявил торжествующе: "Роза Кастилии". Уловили соль? Рожа, костыль. Гы!Шутливо ткнул он мистера ОМэддена Берка под селезенку. Мистер ОМэдден Берк откинулся манерно назад, на свой зонтик, и сделал вид, будто задыхается. Помогите!  выдохнул он.  Мне дурно.На носки привстав, Ленехан немедля принялся обмахивать лицо его шелестящими листочками.Профессор, возвращаясь на место мимо подшивок, тронул легонько рукою распущенные галстуки Стивена и мистера ОМэддена Берка. Париж в прошлом и настоящем. Вы выглядите как коммунары. Как те парни, что взорвали Бастилию,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой с мягкой иронией.  Или, может, это как раз вы с ним пристрелили генерал-губернатора Финляндии? Судя по виду, вы бы вполне могли. Генерала Бобрикова[].ОМНИУМ ПОНЕМНОГУМ Мы еще только собирались,  отвечал Стивен. Соцветие всех талантов,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Юриспруденция, древние языки Скачки,  вставил Ленехан. Литература, журналистика. А будь еще Блум,  сказал профессор,  тогда и тонкое искусство рекламы. И мадам Блум,  добавил мистер ОМэдден Берк.  Муза пения. Любимица всего Дублина.Ленехан громко кашлянул[]. Гм-гм!  произнес он, сильно понизив голос.  Глоток свежего воздуха!Я простудился в парке. Ворота были отворены.ВЫ ЭТО МОЖЕТЕ!Редактор положил Стивену на плечо нервную руку. Я хочу, чтобы вы написали что-нибудь для меня,  сказал он.  Что-нибудь задиристое. Вы это можете. Я по лицу вижу[]. В словаре молодости[]По лицу вижу. По глазам вижу. Маленький ленивый выдумщик. Ящур!  воскликнул редактор с презрительным вызовом.  Великое сборище националистов в Боррис-ин-Оссори[]. Сплошная дичь! Надо таранить публику! Дайте-ка им что-нибудь задиристое. Вставьте туда нас всех, черт его побери. Отца, Сына и Святого Духа и Дристуна Маккарти[]. Мы все можем доставить пищу для ума,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.Стивен, подняв глаза, встретил дерзкий и блуждающий взгляд. Он вас хочет в шайку газетчиков,  пояснил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.ВЕЛИКИЙ ГАЛЛАХЕР Вы это можете,  повторил Майлс Кроуфорд, подкрепляя слова энергичным жестом.  Вот погодите. Мы парализуем Европу, как выражался Игнатий Галлахер, когда он мытарствовал, подрабатывал маркером на бильярде в отеле Кларенс. Галлахер, вот это был журналист. Вот это перо. Знаете, как он сделал карьеру? Я вам расскажу. Виртуознейший образец журнализма за все времена. Дело было в восемьдесят первом[], шестого мая, в пору непобедимых, убийства в парке Феникс, я думаю, вас тогда еще и на свете не было. Сейчас покажу.Он двинулся мимо них к подшивкам. Вот, глядите,  сказал он, оборачиваясь,  Нью-Йорк уорлд запросил специально по телеграфу. Припоминаете?Профессор Макхью кивнул. "Нью-Йорк уорлд",  говорил редактор, приходя в возбуждение и двигая шляпу на затылок.  Где все происходило. Тим Келли, или, верней, Кавана, Джо Брэди и остальные. Где Козья Шкура правил лошадьми. Весь их маршрут, понятно? Козья Шкура,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.  Фицхаррис. Говорят, теперь он Приют извозчика держит у Баттского моста. Это мне Холохан сказал. Знаете Холохана? Прыг-скок, этот, что ли?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд. И Гамли, бедняга, тоже там, так он мне сказал, стережет булыжники для города. Ночной сторож.Стивен с удивлением обернулся. Гамли?  переспросил он.  Да что вы? Тот, что друг моего отца? Да бросьте вы Гамли,  прикрикнул сердито Майлс Кроуфорд.  Пускай стережет булыжники, чтобы не убежали. Взгляните сюда. Что сделал Игнатий Галлахер? Сейчас вам скажу. Гениальное вдохновение. Телеграфировал немедленно. Тут есть Уикли фримен за семнадцатое марта? Прекрасно. Видите это?Он перелистал подшивку и ткнул пальцем. Вот, скажем, четвертая страница, реклама кофе фирмы Брэнсом. Видите? Прекрасно.Зажужжал телефон.ГОЛОС ИЗДАЛЕКА Я подойду,  сказал профессор, направляясь в кабинет. Б  это ворота парка. Отлично.Его трясущийся палец тыкал нетвердо в одну точку за другой. Т  резиденция вице-короля. К  место, где произошло убийство. Н  Нокмарунские ворота.Дряблые складки у него на шее колыхались как сережки у петуха. Плохо накрахмаленная манишка вдруг выскочила, и он резким движением сунул ее обратно в жилет. Алло? Редакция Ивнинг телеграф Алло? Кто говорит? ДаДа Да От Ф до П  это путь, которым ехал Козья Шкура для алиби. Инчикор, Раундтаун, Уинди Арбор, Пальмерстон парк, Ранела. Ф.А.Б.П. Понятно? Х  трактир Дэви на Верхней Лисон-стрит.Профессор показался в дверях кабинета. Это Блум звонит,  сказал он. Пошлите его ко всем чертям,  без промедления отвечал редактор.  Х  это трактир Берка. Ясно?ЛОВКО, И ДАЖЕ ОЧЕНЬ Ловко,  сказал Ленехан.  И даже очень. Преподнес им все на тарелочке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Всю эту дьявольскую историю.Кошмар, от которого ты никогда не проснешься. Я видел сам,  с гордостью произнес редактор.  Я сам был при этом.Дик Адаме[], золотое сердце, добрейший из всех мерзавцев, кого только Господь сподобил родиться в Корке,  и я.Ленехан отвесил поклон воображаемой фигуре и объявил: Мадам, а там Адам. А роза упала на лапу Азора. Всю историю!  восклицал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Старушка с Принс-стрит оказалась первой[]. И был там плач и скрежет зубов. Все из-за одного рекламного объявления. Грегор Грэй сделал эскиз для него и сразу на этом пошел в гору. А потом Падди Хупер обработал Тэй Пэя[], и тот взял его к себе в Стар. Сейчас он у Блюменфельда[]. Вот это пресса. Вот это талант.Пайетт[]! Вот кто им всем был папочкой! Отец сенсационной журналистики,  подтвердил Ленехан,  и зять Криса Каллинана[]. Алло? Вы слушаете? Да, он еще здесь. Вы сами зайдите. Где вы сейчас найдете такого репортера, а?  восклицал редактор.Он захлопнул подшивку. Лесьма вовко,  сказал Ленехан мистеру ОМэддену Берку. Весьма ловко,  согласился мистер ОМэдден Берк.Из кабинета появился профессор Макхью. Кстати, о непобедимых, вы обратили внимание, что нескольких лотошников забрали к главному судье Да-да,  с живостью подхватил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.  Леди Дадли[] шла домой через парк, хотела поглядеть, как там прошлогодний циклон повалил деревья, и решила купить открытку с видом Дублина. А открытка-то эта оказалась выпущенной в честь то ли Джо Брэди, то ли Главного[] или Козьей Шкуры. И продавали у самой резиденции вице-короля, можете себе представить! Теперешние годятся только в департамент мелкого вздора,  продолжал свое Майлс Кроуфорд.  Тьфу! Что пресса, что суд! Где вы теперь найдете такого юриста, как те прежние, как Уайтсайд[], как Айзек Батт, как среброустый ОХейган? А? Эх, чушь собачья! Тьфу! Гроша ломаного не стоят!Он смолк, но нервная и презрительная гримаса еще продолжала змеиться на губах у него.Захотела бы какая-нибудь поцеловать эти губы? Как знать! А зачем тогда ты это писал.СКЛАД И ЛАДГубы, клубы. Губы  это каким-то образом клубы, так, что ли? Или же клубы  это губы? Что-то такое должно быть. Клубы, тубы, любы, зубы, грубы. Рифмы: два человека, одеты одинаково, выглядят одинаково, по двое, парами[].          , ,  [].Он видел, как они по трое приближаются, девушки в зеленом[], в розовом, в темно-красном, сплетаясь,   [], в лиловом, в пурпурном,   [] в золоте орифламмы,     []. Но я старик, кающийся, в ногах свинец, подчернотою ночи: губы клубы: могила пленила[]. Говорите лишь за себя,  сказал мистер ОМэдден Берк.ДОВЛЕЕТ ДНЕВИ[]Дж.Дж.ОМоллой со слабою улыбкою принял вызов. Дорогой Майлс,  проговорил он, отбрасывая свою сигарету,  вы сделали неверные выводы из моих слов. В настоящий момент на меня не возложена защита третьей профессии[]  профессии, но все же резвость ваших коркских ног слишком заносит вас[]. Отчего нам не вспомнить Генри Граттана[] и Флуда или Демосфена или Эдмунда Берка? Мы все знаем Игнатия Галлахера и его шефа из Чейплизода, Хармсуорта[], издававшего желтые газетенки, а также и его американского кузена из помойного листка в стиле Бауэри, не говоря уж про Новости Падди Келли[], Приключения Пью и нашего недремлющего друга Скиберинского орла. Зачем непременно вспоминать такого мастера адвокатских речей, как Уайтсайд? Довлеет дневи газета его.ОТЗВУКИ ДАВНИХ ДНЕЙ Граттан и Флуд писали вот для этой самой газеты,  выкрикнул редактор ему в лицо.  Патриоты и добровольцы. А теперь вы где? Основана в -м.Доктор Льюкас[]. А кого сейчас можно сравнить с Джоном Филпотом Каррэном[]?Тьфу! Ну, что ж,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой,  вот, скажем, королевский адвокат Буш[]. Буш?  повторил редактор.  Что же, согласен. Буш, я согласен. У него в крови это есть. Кендал Буш, то есть, я хочу сказать, Сеймур Буш. Он бы уже давно восседал в судьях,  сказал профессор,  если бы не Ну ладно, не будем.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой повернулся к Стивену и тихо, с расстановкой сказал: Я думаю, самая отточенная фраза, какую я слышал в жизни, вышла из уст Сеймура Буша. Слушалось дело о братоубийстве, то самое дело Чайлдса. Буш защищал его.И мне в ушную полость влил настой[].Кстати, как же он узнал это? Ведь он умер во сне. Или эту другую историю[], про зверя с двумя спинами? И какова же она была?  спросил профессор.,  [] Он говорил о принципе правосудия на основе доказательств, согласно римскому праву,  сказал ОМоллой.  Он противопоставлял его более древнему Моисееву закону[],  [], и здесь напомнил про Моисея Микеланджело в Ватикане[]. М-да. Несколько тщательно подобранных слов,  возвестил Ленехан.  Тишина!Последовала пауза. Дж.Дж.ОМоллой извлек свой портсигар.Напрасно замерли. Какая-нибудь ерунда.Вестник задумчиво вынул спички и закурил сигару.Позднее я часто думал, оглядываясь назад, на эти странные дни, не это ли крохотное действие, столь само по себе пустое, это чирканье этой спички, определило впоследствии всю судьбу двух наших существований[].ОТТОЧЕННАЯ ФРАЗАДж.Дж.ОМоллой продолжал, оттеняя каждое слово: Он сказал о нем: это музыка, застывшая в мраморе, каменное изваяние, рогатое и устрашающее, божественное в человеческой форме, это вечный символ мудрости и прозрения, который достоин жить, если только достойно жить что-либо, исполненное воображением или рукою скульптора во мраморе, духовно преображенном и преображающем .Волнистое движение его гибкой руки эхом сопровождало фразу. Блестяще!  тотчас отозвался Майлс Кроуфорд. Божественное вдохновение,  промолвил мистер ОМэдден Берк. А вам понравилось?  спросил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой у Стивена.Стивен, плененный до глубины красотой языка и жеста, лишь молча покраснел. Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара, и Дж.Дж.ОМоллой протянул портсигар Майлсу Кроуфорду. Ленехан, как и прежде, дал им прикурить, а потом уцепил трофей, говоря: Премногус благодаримус.ВЫСОКОНРАВСТВЕННЫЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК Профессор Мэйдженнис[] мне говорил про вас,  обратился ОМоллой к Стивену.  Скажите по правде, что вы думаете обо всей этой толпе герметистов, поэтов опалового безмолвия, с верховным мистом А.Э.? Все началось с этой дамы Блаватской. Уж это была замысловатая штучка. В одном интервью, которое он дал какому-то янки[], А.Э. рассказывал, как вы однажды явились к нему чуть свет и стали допытываться о планах сознания[].Мэйдженнис считает, что вы, должно быть, решили попросту разыграть А.Э. Он человек высочайшей нравственности, Мэйдженнис.Говорил обо мне. Но что он сказал? Что он сказал? Что он сказал обо мне? Нет, не спрошу. Спасибо,  сказал профессор Макхью, отклоняя от себя портсигар.  Погодите минуту. Позвольте, я кое-что скажу. Прекраснейшим образцом ораторского искусства, какой я слышал, была речь Джона Ф.Тэйлора[] на заседании университетского исторического общества. Сначала говорил судья Фицгиббон[], теперешний глава апелляционного суда, а обсуждали они нечто довольно новое по тем временам, эссе, где ратовалось за возрождение ирландского языка.Он обернулся к Майлсу Кроуфорду и сказал: Вы ведь знаете Джеральда Фицгиббона, так что можете себе представить стиль его речи. По слухам, он заседает с Тимом Хили[],  вставил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой,  в административной комиссии колледжа Тринити. Он заседает с милым крошкой в детском нагрудничке,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Валяйте дальше. Ну и что? Прошу заметить,  продолжал профессор,  что это была речь опытного оратора, с безупречной дикцией, исполненная учтивого высокомерия и изливающая, не скажу чашу гнева, но скорей горделивое презрение к новому движению[]. Тогда это было новым движением. Мы были слабы и, стало быть, ни на что не годны.На мгновение он сомкнул свои тонкие длинные губы, но, стремясь продолжать, поднес широко отставленную руку к очкам и, коснувшись черной оправы подрагивающими пальцами, безымянным и большим, слегка передвинул фокус.ИМПРОВИЗАЦИЯНарочито будничным тоном он обратился к Дж.Дж.ОМоллою: А Тэйлор, надо вам знать, явился туда больной, встал с постели. И я не верю, что он заранее приготовил речь, потому что во всем зале не было ни единой стенографистки. Лицо у него было смуглое, исхудалое, с лохматой бородой во все стороны. На шее болтался какой-то шарф, а сам он выглядел едва ли не умирающим (хотя таковым и не был).Взгляд его тут же, хотя и без торопливости, двинулся от Дж.Дж.ОМоллоя к Стивену и тут же потом обратился книзу, будто ища что-то. За склоненною головой обнаружился ненакрахмаленный полотняный воротничок, засаленный от редеющих волос. Все так же ища, он сказал: Когда Фицгиббон закончил речь, Джон Ф.Тэйлор взял ответное слово. И вот что он говорил, вкратце и насколько могу припомнить.Твердым движением он поднял голову. Глаза снова погрузились во вспоминание. Неразумные моллюски плавали в толстых линзах туда и сюда, ища выхода.Он начал: Господин председатель, леди и джентльмены! Велико было мое восхищение словами, с которыми только что обратился к молодежи Ирландии мой ученый друг. Мне чудилось, будто я перенесся в страну, очень отдаленную от нашей, и в эпоху, очень далекую от нынешней, будто я нахожусь в Древнем Египте и слушаю речь некоего первосвященника той земли, обращенную к юному Моисею .Его слушатели, все внимание, застыли с сигаретами в пальцах, и дым от них восходил тонкими побегами, распускавшимися по мере его речи. Пусть дым от алтарей[]. Близятся благородные слова. Посмотрим. А если бы самому попробовать силы? И чудилось мне, будто я слышу, как в голосе этого египетского первосвященника звучат надменность и горделивость. И услышал я слова его, и смысл их открылся мне .ИЗ ОТЦОВ ЦЕРКВИОткрылось мне, что только доброе может стать хуже[], если бы это было абсолютное добро или вовсе бы не было добром, то оно не могло бы стать хуже. А, черт побери! Это же из святого Августина. Отчего вы, евреи, не хотите принять нашей культуры и нашей религии и нашего языка? Вы  племя кочующих пастухов: мы  могущественный народ. У вас нет городов и нет богатств: наши города словно людские муравейники, и наши барки, триремы и квадриремы, груженные всевозможными товарами, бороздят воды всего известного мира. Вы едва вышли из первобытного состояния: у нас есть литература, священство, многовековая история и государственные законы .Нил.Ребенок  мужчина  изваяние[].На берегу Нила прислужницы преклонили колена, тростниковая люлька  муж, искусный в битве  каменнорогий, каменнобородый, сердце каменное. Вы поклоняетесь темному безвестному идолу: в наших храмах, таинственных и великолепных, обитают Изида и Озирис. Гор и Амон Ра. Ваш удел  рабство, страх, унижения: наш  громы и моря. Израиль слаб и малочисленны сыны его: Египет  несметное воинство, и грозно его оружие. Бродягами и поденщиками зоветесь вы: от нашего имени содрогается мир .Беззвучная голодная отрыжка ворвалась в его речь. Повышением голоса он отважно поборол ее: Но, леди и джентльмены, если бы юноша Моисей внял этой речи и принял бы этот взгляд на жизнь, если бы он склонил свою голову, склонил свою волю, склонил дух свой пред этим надменным поучением, то никогда бы не вывел он избранный народ из дома рабства и не последовал бы днем за столпом облачным. Никогда бы не говорил он с Предвечным средь молний на вершине Синая и не сошел бы с нее, сияя отсветами боговдохновения на лице, неся в руках скрижали закона, выбитые на языке изгоев .Он смолк и оглядел их, наслаждаясь молчанием.ЗЛОВЕЩИЙ ЗНАК  ДЛЯ НЕГО!Дж.Дж.ОМоллой не без сожаленья заметил: И все же он умер, не ступив на землю обетованную. Внезапная  в  тот  миг  хотя  и  от  продолжительной  болезни  нередко  задолго  сжижаемая  кончина,  изрек Ленехан.  И позади у него лежало великое будущее.Послышалось, как стадо босых ног ринулось через вестибюль и по лестнице вверх. Вот что такое искусство речи,  сказал профессор, не встретив ничьего возражения.Унесено ветром. Людские скопища в Моллахмасте и в Таре королевской[]. На целые мили  ушные полости. Громовые речи трибуна звучат  и развеиваются ветром. Народ обретал убежище в его голосе. Умершие звуки. Акаша-хроника где все что происходило когда-нибудь где-нибудь где угодно. Обожайте его и восхваляйте  но с меня хватит.У меня есть деньги. Джентльмены,  произнес Стивен.  Следующим пунктом повестки дня позвольте внести предложение о переносе заседания в другое место. Вы меня изумляете. Надеюсь, это не пустая любезность на французский манер?  спросил мистер ОМэдден Берк.  Ибо, мыслю, сие есть время, когда винный кувшин, выражаясь метафорически, особливо приятствен в древней вашей гостинице. Быть по сему и настоящим решительно решено. Все кто за говори в глаза,  возгласил Ленехан.  Прочим молчок. Объявляю предложение принятым. В какое же именно питейное заведение? Подаю свой голос за Муни!Он возглавил шествие, поучая: Мы резко отвергнем возлияния крепких напитков, разве не так? Так да не так. Ни под каким видом.Мистер ОМэдден Берк, шедший за ним вплотную, произнес, делая соратнический выпад зонтом: Рази, Макдуф[]! Весь в папашу!  воскликнул редактор, хлопнув Стивена по плечу.  Двинулись. Где эти чертовы ключи?Он порылся в кармане и вытащил смятые листки. Ящур. Помню. Все будет в порядке. Пойдет. Где же они? Все в порядке.Он снова сунул листки в карман и ушел в кабинет.БУДЕМ НАДЕЯТЬСЯДж.Дж.ОМоллой, собравшись последовать за ним, тихо сказал Стивену: Надеюсь, вы доживете, пока это напечатают. Майлс, одну минутку.Он прошел в кабинет, затворив дверь за собой. Пойдемте, Стивен,  позвал профессор.  Это было блестяще, не правда ли? Прямо-таки пророческие виденья.  []! Разграбление бурной Трои. Царства мира сего. Былые властители Средиземноморья  ныне феллахи.Первый мальчишка-газетчик, стуча пятками, промчался по лестнице и ринулся мимо них на улицу с воплем: Специальный выпуск, скачки!Дублин. Мне еще многому, многому учиться.Они повернули налево по Эбби-стрит. Меня тоже посетило видение,  сказал Стивен. В самом деле?  сказал профессор, подлаживаясь с ним в ногу.  Кроуфорд нас догонит.Еще один мальчишка пронесся мимо них, вопя на бегу: Специальный выпуск, скачки!ДОБРЫЙ ДРЯХЛЫЙ ДУБЛИН[]Дублинцы. Две дублинские весталки[],  начал Стивен,  престарелые и набожные, прожили пятьдесят и пятьдесят три года на Фамболли-лейн. Это где такое?  спросил профессор. Неподалеку от Блэкпиттса.Сырая ночь с голодными запахами пекарни. У стены. Пухлое лицо поблескивает под дешевою шалью. Неистовые сердца. Акаша-хроника. Поживей, милок!Вперед. Попробуй, рискни. Да будет жизнь. Они желают посмотреть панораму Дублина с вершины колонны Нельсона. У них накоплено три шиллинга десять пенсов в красной жестяной копилке в виде почтового ящика. Они вытряхивают оттуда трехпенсовые монетки и шестипенсовики, а пенсы выуживают, помогая себе лезвием ножа. Два шиллинга три пенса серебром, один шиллинг семь пенсов медью. Они надевают шляпки и воскресные платья, берут с собой зонтики на случай дождя. Мудрые девы[],  сказал профессор Макхью.ЖИЗНЬ БЕЗ ПРИКРАС Они покупают на шиллинг четыре пенса грудинки и четыре ломтя формового хлеба у мисс Кейт Коллинз, хозяйки Северных Столовых на Мальборо-стрит. Потом они покупают двадцать и четыре спелые сливы у девчонки, торгующей у самого подножия колонны Нельсона, чтобы утолять жажду после грудинки. И, заплатив две трехпенсовые монетки джентльмену у турникета, они медленно начинают взбираться по винтовой лестнице, кряхтя, подбадривая друг друга, пугаясь темных мест, борясь с одышкой, переспрашивая одна другую, а грудинка у вас, вознося хвалы Господу и Пречистой Деве, грозясь повернуть назад и выглядывая в смотровые щели.У уфф, слава Богу. Мы и понятия не имели, что это так высоко.Зовут их Энн Карнс и Флоренс Маккейб. Энн Карнс страдает радикулитом и растирается от него лурдской водой, которую ей дала одна леди, а та получила бутылочку от одного монаха-пассиониста[]. У Флоренс Маккейб каждую субботу на ужин свиные ножки и бутылка двойного пива. Антитезис,  молвил профессор, кивая дважды.  Девы-весталки. Так и вижу их. Но что же наш друг там мешкает?Он обернулся.Стая стремглав летящих мальчишек неслась вниз по ступеням, разлетаясь во все стороны, вопя, размахивая белыми листами газет. За ними на лестнице появился Майлс Кроуфорд, в нимбе шляпы вокруг малиновой физиономии, продолжая беседовать с Дж.Дж.ОМоллоем. Нагоняйте,  крикнул ему профессор и помахал рукой.Затем он снова зашагал рядом со Стивеном.ВОЗВРАЩЕНИЕ БЛУМА Да-да,  сказал он,  я их вижу.Мистер Блум, весь запыхавшийся, попавший в оголтелый водоворот мальчишек-газетчиков возле редакций Айриш католик и Дублин пенни джорнэл, воззвал: Мистер Кроуфорд! Минуточку! "Телеграф"! Специальный выпуск, скачки! Ну, в чем дело?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд, замедляя шаг.Выкрик газетчика раздался перед самым носом мистера Блума: Ужасная трагедия в Рэтмайнсе! Ребенка защемило тисками!ИНТЕРВЬЮ С РЕДАКТОРОМ Все об этой рекламе,  начал мистер Блум, проталкиваясь к ступеням, отдуваясь и вынимая вырезку из кармана.  Я только что говорил с мистером Ключчи. Он сказал, что закажет на два месяца. А там посмотрит. Но он еще хочет заметку в Телеграфе, в субботнем розовом, чтобы привлечь внимание.Я уже говорил советнику Наннетти, он хочет такую же, как была в Килкенни пипл, если еще не слишком поздно. Я бы мог ее взять в Национальной Библиотеке. Понимаете, дом ключей. Его фамилия Ключчи, получается игра слов. Но он, можно считать, обещал, что закажет. Но он только хочет, чтобы это немножко раздуть Что мне ему передать, мистер Кроуфорд?П.М.Ж. Передайте, что он может поцеловать меня в жопу!  отрезал Майлс Кроуфорд, сделав выразительный жест.  Вот так в натуре и передайте.Слегка нервничает. Надо поосторожней. Все двинулись выпить. Рука об руку. Морская фуражка Ленехана поспешает на дармовщинку. Как всегда подольстился. Интересно кто всех подбил молодой Дедал что ли. Сегодня на нем вполне приличные башмаки. В последний раз как я его видел у него пятки высвечивали. И где-то вляпался в грязь. Беззаботный малый. Что же он делал в Айриштауне? Что же,  сказал мистер Блум, снова переводя взгляд на редактора.  Если я достану эскиз, стоит, по-моему, поместить маленькую заметку. Думаю, он даст это объявление. Я ему передамП.М.Б.И.Ж. Он может поцеловать мою благородную ирландскую жопу[]!  громогласно объявил Майлс Кроуфорд.  Совершенно в любое время, так вот и передайте.И покуда мистер Блум стоял, взвешивая положение и нерешительно улыбаясь, он двинулся дальше своей подергивающейся походкой.В ПОИСКАХ ССУДЫ  [], Джек,  сказал он, поднося руку к подбородку.  Я и сам вот посюда. Тоже крупные передряги. Не далее как на прошлой неделе разыскивал, кто бы дал поручительство под мой вексель. Мне очень жаль, Джек. Будь хоть малейшая возможность. Если бы мог где-нибудь найти, я бы со всей душой.Дж.Дж.ОМоллой кисло поморщился и молча зашагал дальше. Они нагнали остальных и пошли рядом с ними. И когда они съели свою грудинку и хлеб и вытерли все двадцать пальцев о бумагу от хлеба, тогда они подошли поближе к перилам. Тут кое-что для вас,  пояснил профессор Майлсу Кроуфорду.  Две дублинские старушки на вершине колонны Нельсона.НУ И КОЛОННА!  ВОТ ЧТО СКАЗАЛА ПЕРВАЯ ИЗ ВЗОБРАВШИХСЯ Это свежо,  одобрил Майлс Кроуфорд.  Это материал. Выбрались на гулянье сапожников в Дагл. Две старые плутовки, а дальше что? Но они боятся, что колонна упадет,  продолжал Стивен.  Они глядят на крыши и спорят о том, где какая церковь: голубой купол в Рэтмайнсе, Адама и Евы, святого Лаврентия ОТула. Но, когда смотрят, у них начинает кружиться голова, так что они задирают платьяЛЕГКАЯ НЕОБУЗДАННОСТЬ ЭТИХ ЖЕНЩИН Полегче,  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд.  Без поэтических вольностей. Мы тут в епархии архиепископа. И усаживаются на свои полосатые исподние юбки, взирая вверх на статую однорукого прелюбодея[]. Однорукий прелюбодей!  воскликнул профессор.  Мне это нравится. Я уловил мысль.

Они ставят между собой пакет со сливами и начинают их поедать одну за другой, утирая платочками сливовый сок, стекающий изо рта, и не спеша выплевывая косточки через перила.В конце у него вдруг вырвался громкий молодой смех. Услышав его, Ленехан и мистер ОМэдден Берк обернулись и, помахав им, повернули наискосок в сторону Муни. Это все?  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд.

ИТАКИЙЦЫ БОЖАТСЯ, ЧТО ИХ ПЕН ЧЕМПИОНКА Вы мне напоминаете Антисфена[],  сказал профессор,  ученика софиста Горгия. О нем рассказывают, что никак не могли решить, кого он яростнее хулил, других или же себя самого. Он был сыном аристократа и рабыни. И он написал книгу, в которой отнял пальму первенства по красоте у аргивянки Елены и передал ее бедной Пенелопе.Бедная Пенелопа.

Наемные экипажи, кабриолеты, ломовые телеги, почтовые фургоны, собственные кареты, повозки для газированных минеральных вод с громыхающими ящиками бутылок громыхали, катили, влекомые лошадьми,  стремительно.КАК?  И АНАЛОГИЧНО  ГДЕ? А как вы это назовете?  осведомился Майлс Кроуфорд.  И где они взяли сливы?ИЗ ВЕРГИЛИЯ, ГОВОРИТ ПЕДАГОГ.

Нет,  отвечал Стивен.  Я это назову: Вид на Палестину с горы Фасги[], или Притча о сливах . Я понимаю,  сказал профессор.Он звучно рассмеялся. Понимаю,  повторил он с явным удовольствием.  Моисей и земля обетованная.

Такая фосфоресценция, голубовато-зеленоватая. Для мозга очень полезно.От угла дома Батлера рядом с памятником он глянул вдоль Бэйчлорз-уок.Дедалова дочка еще все там, возле Аукционов Диллона. Какую-нибудь старую мебель продают. Узнал ее сразу по глазам совершенно отцовские. Слоняется ждет его. Всегда дом разваливается после смерти матери. А у него пятнадцать детей.

Подрывает здоровье.Когда он ступил на мост ОКоннелла, клуб дыма, пышно распускаясь, поднялся над парапетом. Баржа пивоварни с экспортным портером. В Англию. Я слышал он от морского воздуха скисает. Интересно бы как-нибудь получить пропуск через Хэнкока да посмотреть эту пивоварню. Целый особый мир.Кругом бочки с портером, красота. Но крысы и туда забираются.

Конечно, если бы мы обо всем знали.Глянув вниз, он увидел, как, шумно хлопая крыльями, меж мрачных стен набережной кружат чайки. Свежо на море. А если я брошусь вниз? Сын Рувима Дж. наверняка наглотался этих помоев полное брюхо. Переплатил шиллинг и восемь пенсов. Хе-хе. Забавная у него манера вдруг вставить историю ни с того ни с сего. И рассказывать их умеет.Чайки, кружа, снижались. Ищут себе поживу. А ну-ка.Он бросил в стаю скатанный бумажный комок. Илия грядет, скорость тридцать два фута в сек. Не обманулись. Комок, оставленный без внимания, закачался на затухающей волне, уплыл под устои моста. Не такие уж полные дураки. Когда я в тот день черствый пирог выбросил за борт Короля Эрина небось подобрали в полсотне ярдов за кормой. Соображают. Они кружили, хлопая крыльями.Унылая тощая чайка,Куда ты летишь, отвечай-ка!Вот так поэты и пишут, надо чтоб одинаковые звуки. Да но у Шекспира рифм нет  белый стих. Это поток языка. Мысли.

А бедные птахи.Он снова остановился, купил у старушки с яблоками два сладких пирожка на пенни, разломал на кусочки и бросил в Лиффи[]. Видали? Чайки налетели бесшумно, две, потом остальные, ринулись вниз, набрасываясь на добычу.Готово. Начисто расхватали.Явственно ощущая их пронырливую жадность, он отряхнул мелкие крошки с ладоней. Небось не ждали такого. Манна небесная. Они все кормятся рыбьим мясом вся эта морская птица чайки гагары. Лебеди из Анны Лиффи сюда иногда заплывают покрасоваться. О вкусах не спорят.

Уж он не стал бы?Нет, нет.Мистер Блум зашагал вперед, оторвав от реки встревоженный взгляд. Не надо об этом думать. Уже больше часу. На часах портового управления шар внизу. Время по Дансинку. Отличная эта книжица сэра Роберта Болла[], так увлекательно. Параллакс. Никогда толком не мог понять. А вот как раз священник. Можно бы у него спросить. Пар это греческое: параллель, параллакс. Метим псу хвост так она это называла пока я ей не объяснил про переселение. Ну и дичь!Улыбка мистера Блума ну и дичь досталась двум окнам портового управления. По сути она права. Выдумывают пышные названия обычным вещам.Звучности ради. Она остроумием не отличается. Бывает и грубой. Может выболтать что у меня на уме. И все-таки не уверен. Скажем она придумала, что у Бена Долларда не бас-баритон, а бас-бормотон. Потому что когда поет, половину звуков глотает и ни слова не разберешь. Чем это не остроумно. Ему раньше дали прозвище Большой Бен. Совсем не так остроумно как бас-бормотон никакого сравнения. Прожорлив как альбатрос. Уплел подчистую цельный говяжий филей. И в выпивке удержу не знает, налижется как последний обормот. Бас-обормот-он. Вот и опять подходит.Навстречу ему вдоль сточной канавы медленно двигалась цепочка людей, одетых в белое, на каждом рекламная доска с ярко-алой полосой поперек.Распродажа. Похожи на этого священника утром: мы грешники, мы страдали. Он прочитал алые буквы на их пяти белых высоких шляпах: ..-.. Уиздом Хили. "" приотстал, вытащил ломоть хлеба из-под своей доски, сунул в рот и принялся жевать на ходу. Наше главное блюдо. Три монеты в день, и тащись вдоль этих канав, улица за улицей. Только на хлеб с похлебкой, чтоб ноги не протянуть. Они не от Бойла  нет  они от Макглэйда. Но этим торговлю не оживишь. Я ему предлагал устроить рекламную повозку: застекленный фургон и в нем две шикарные девицы сидят, пишут письма, а кругом всякие тетрадки, конверты, промокашки. Вот это бы привлекло внимание, я ручаюсь.Шикарные девицы пишут что-то такое  это сразу бросается в глаза. Всякому до смерти любопытно, а что это она пишет. Станешь, уставившись на пустое место  тут же вокруг тебя двадцать человек. Боятся, не упустить бы чего.Женщины тут же. Любопытство. Соляной столп. Конечно, он отказался, потому что не он первый придумал. Или еще я предложил пузырек для чернил с обманным пятном из целлулоида. Его-то рекламные идеи под стать тому объявлению о паштетах Сливи, прямо под некрологами, раздел холодного мяса.Вам не требуется их лизать. Что? Наши конверты. Хэлло! Джонс, можно вас на минутку?

Адова работа была получать по счетам в монастырях. Монастырь Транквилла. Там была очень милая монашка, на редкость приятное лицо. Клобук вполне шел к ее небольшой головке.Сестра? Сестра? Уверен что у нее была несчастная любовь по глазам ясно.Ужасно неловко когда надо о делах с такой женщиной. В то утро я ее оторвал от молитв. Но рада была пообщаться с миром. Сегодня у нас великий день[], сказала она. Праздник Богоматери Кармельской. Тоже приятное название: карамель. Она знала думаю знала судя по тому как она. Если бы вышла замуж она изменилась бы. Похоже у них и вправду было туго с деньгами. Но при всем том готовили только на лучшем масле. Никакого свиного сала. Мне всегда потом плохо как поешь слишком жирного. Они любят подмасливаться и внутри и снаружи. Молли его пробовала, подняла вуаль. Сестра? Пэт Клэффи, дочка ростовщика. Говорят колючую проволоку придумала какая-то монашка.Он пересек Уэстморленд-стрит, когда мимо прошаркал устало "" с апострофом. Торговля велосипедами Ровер. Гонки сегодня. Сколько же лет с тех пор?

Десять лет назад: он умер в девяносчетвертом да все верно большой пожар у Арнотта. Вэл Диллон тогда был лорд-мэром[]. Обед в Гленкри[]. Советник Боб ОРейли вылил себе портвейн в суп еще до того как все начали. И давай Боббоббоб хлебать по зову внутреннего советника. Весь оркестр заглушил. За то что уже нам досталось да будем мы Богу. Милли была еще совсем крошкой.А Молли надела то платье слоново-серое с вышитыми лягушками. Мужского покроя, пуговицы сама обтянула. Она его не любила потому что я ногу растянул в первый день как она надела его. Как будто платье виной. На пикнике с ее хором это было, у горы Шугарлоф. Старому Гудвину цилиндр уделали чем-то липким. Мухам тоже пикник. Потом она уж не носила таких платьев. Оно как перчатка ей всюду было в обтяжку, и в плечах и в бедрах.Тогда только-только начинала полнеть. Ели пирог с крольчатиной. Все на нее заглядывались.Счастливые дни. Счастливее чем сейчас. Уютная комнатка с красными обоями. От Докрелла, шиллинг и девять пенсов рулон. Купанье Милли по вечерам. Американское мыло тогда купил: бузиновое. Вода в ее ванночке хорошо пахла. Какая смешная она была когда вся в пене. И стройненькая.Сейчас фотография. У бедного папы было ателье дагерротипов[]. Рассказывал мне про это. Наследственное увлечение.Он шел по обочине тротуара.Поток жизни. Как того парня звали что смахивал на священника и вечно проходя косился на наши окна? Слабые глаза, женщина. Снимал в доме Цитрона на Сент-Кевин-пэрейд. Как-то на пен. Пенденнис[]? Память сдает. Пен?Правда уж столько лет прошло. Наверно трамвайный шум действует. Уж если он не мог вспомнить как зовут старосту дневной смены которого каждый день видит.А тенора звали Бартелл дАрси, он тогда только начинал[]. Провожал ее домой с репетиций. Самодовольный тип с нафабренными усами. Дал ей песню Южные ветры[].Какой был ветер в ту ночь когда я зашел за ней было то собрание ложи[] насчет лотерейных билетов после концерта Гудвина в ратуше, то ли в банкетном то ли в дубовом зале. Он, и я следом. Листок с ее нотами у меня вырвало из рук, застрял в ограде лицея. Хорошо еще не. Такая мелочь может ей отравить все впечатление от вечера. Впереди профессор Гудвин под руку с ней. Весьма нетвердо ступая, старый пьянчужка. Его прощальные концерты.Абсолютно последнее выступление на сцене. То быть может на месяц иль быть может навек[]. Помню она хохотала на ветру укутанная в высокий воротник. А помнишь как рванул ветер на углу Харкорт-роуд. Ух! Бр-р! Взметнул все ее юбки, боа обвилось вокруг старины Гудвина, тот чуть не задохся. Она раскраснелась от ветра. Помнишь когда вернулись домой. Мы разгребли угли в очаге поджарили ей на ужин ломти бараньего седла с любимым ее кисло-сладким соусом. Подогрели ром. Мне было видно от очага как она в спальне расшнуровывает корсет. Белый.С мягким шорохом корсет упал на постель. В нем всегда оставалось ее тепло. А ей было всегда приятно из него высвободиться. Потом сидела на постели почти до двух вынимала из волос шпильки. Милли уютно свернулась в гнездышке. Счастливое время. Счастливое время. В эту ночь О, мистер Блум, как поживаете? О, как поживаете, миссис Брин? Что толку жаловаться. Как там Молли? Я ее не видела целую вечность. Превосходно,  весело отозвался мистер Блум.  А Милли, знаете, получила место в Моллингаре. Да что вы! Ведь это для нее большой шаг? Да, она там у одного фотографа. Все идет как по маслу. А как все ваши подопечные? На аппетит не жалуются,  ответила миссис Брин.А сколько их у нее? Кругом вроде никого. Я вижу, вы в черном. У вас не Нет-нет,  сказал мистер Блум.  Просто я с похорон.Теперь целый день так будет, я чувствую. Кто умер, когда да отчего умер. Не отвяжешься. Какое несчастье,  сказала миссис Брин.  Надеюсь, это не кто-нибудь из близких?Раз уж так вызовем у нее сочувствие. Дигнам,  сказал мистер Блум.  Из старых моих друзей. Бедняга, он умер скоропостижно. Кажется, сердечный приступ. Похороны были сегодня утром.Твои похороны завтраПока ты бредешь во-ржиТрампам тамтамТрампам[] Как это грустно, терять старых друзей,  женственно-меланхолически выразил взор миссис Брин.И хватит об этом. Спокойно, просто: про мужа. А как ваш господин и повелитель?Миссис Брин возвела к небу свои большие глаза. Все-таки это у ней осталось еще. Ах, ради Бога, не будем!  сказала она.  Гремучим змеям, и тем его стоит остерегаться. Сейчас он сидит вон там со своими кодексами, ищет закон против диффамации. Одно мучение с ним. Минутку, я сейчас покажу вам.Горячий пар телячьего супа, дух свежевыпеченных сладких булочек, пудингов плыли из кафе Гаррисона. От крепкого полдневного запаха у мистера Блума защекотало в глотке. Собираются делать выпечку, масло, мука высший сорт, сахар из Демерары, или уже отведывают с чайком. Или это от нее?Босоногий мальчишка торчал у решетки, впивая запахи. Пытается притупить грызущий голод. Это ему удовольствие или страдание? Обед за пенни. Вилка и нож прикованы на цепочке к столу.Открывает сумочку, потертая кожа. Шляпная булавка: с такими вещами надо поосторожней. Может попасть кому-нибудь в глаз в трамвае. Роется. Все раскрыто. Деньги. Хочешь  бери. Они готовы с ума сойти если потеряют хоть шестипенсовик. Мировой скандал. Муж рвет и мечет. Где десять шиллингов что я дал тебе в понедельник? Ты что, всех родственничков своих кормишь?Платок замусоленный, пузырек от лекарства. Упало что-то таблетка. Что она там? Наверно, сейчас новолуние,  сказала она.  В это время с ним всегда плохо. Знаете, что он в эту ночь сделал?Рука ее перестала рыться. Глаза смотрели пристально на него, тревожно расширенные, но улыбающиеся. Что же?  спросил мистер Блум.Пускай говорит. Смотри ей прямо в глаза. Я тебе верю. Можешь мне доверять. Разбудил меня ночью,  сказала она.  Ему приснился кошмарный сон.Несваре. Сказал, что по лестнице поднимается пиковый туз. Пиковый туз!  изумился мистер Блум.Она вынула из сумочки сложенную вдвое открытку. Вот, прочтите,  сказала она.  Он получил ее этим утром. Что это такое?  спросил мистер Блум, разглядывая открытку.  К.К.? К.К.: ку-ку[],  сказала она.  Кто-то над ним издевается, мол, он спятил. Это стыд и позор, кто бы ни сделал это. Разумеется,  сказал мистер Блум.Она со вздохом забрала у него открытку. И сейчас он собрался в контору мистера Ментона. Он говорит, что намерен вчинить иск на десять тысяч фунтов.Она сложила открытку, сунула ее в свою неприглядную сумочку и защелкнула замочек.Тот же костюм синего шевиота что два года назад, только ворс выцветает.Прошли его лучшие времена. Волосы растрепались над ушами. И эта неуклюжая шляпка, три старые виноградные грозди, чтобы хоть малость скрасить. Убогая роскошь. А ведь раньше одевалась со вкусом. Морщинки у рта. Всего на год или около того старше Молли.Но посмотри как эта женщина ее оглядела проходя. Жестоко. Пристрастный пол.Он продолжал смотреть на нее, пряча во взгляде разочарование. Острый суп из телятины и бычьих хвостов с пряностями. Я тоже проголодался. Крошки пирога на отворотах ее костюма; следы сахарной пудры на щеке. Пирог с ревенем и плотной начинкой из разных фруктов. И это бывшая Джози Пауэлл. У Люка Дойла, давным-давно. Долфинсбарн, шарады. К.К.: ку-ку.Переменим тему. А вам случается видеть миссис Бьюфой?  спросил мистер Блум. Майну Пьюрфой?  переспросила она.Это я подумал про Филипа Бьюфоя. Клуб театралов. Мэтчен часто вспоминает свой мастерский удар. А воду-то я спустил? Да. Последний акт. Да. Сейчас по дороге я как раз заходила узнать, не разрешилась ли она уже. Она в родильном доме на Холлс-стрит. Доктор Хорн ее туда поместил.Вот уже три дня схватки. О!  сказал мистер Блум.  Я так ей сочувствую. Да,  продолжала миссис Брин.  А дома и без того детишек полно. Эти роды у нее очень трудные, мне так сестра сказала. О!  сказал мистер Блум.Его глубокий полный жалости взгляд вбирал ее слова. Язык соболезнующе пощелкал. Це! Це! Я так ей сочувствую,  повторил он.  Бедная женщина! Три дня! Ведь это просто ужасно.Миссис Брин согласно кивнула. У нее началось во вторникМистер Блум тронул легонько выступ ее плечевой кости, предупреждая: Посторонитесь немного! Пускай этот человек пройдет.Костлявая фигура, приближаясь со стороны реки, машисто вышагивала по тротуару, застывшим взглядом уставясь в солнечный круг через монокль на грубой тесемке. Крохотная шапочка обтягивала голову так туго, как будто вжималась в череп. На руке в такт шагам болтались сложенный плащ, трость и зонтик. Заметьте-ка,  сказал мистер Блум.  Фонарные столбы он всегда обходит по мостовой. Смотрите! А кто это, если не секрет?  спросила миссис Брин.  У него не все дома? Его зовут Кэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл,  ответил мистер Блум, улыбнувшись.  Смотрите! Имен у него хватает,  сказала она.  Таким вот Дэнис станет когда-нибудь.Внезапно она прервала себя. Ага, вот и он,  сказала она.  Мне надо идти к нему. Всего хорошего. Передавайте Молли привет, не забудете? Обязательно,  сказал мистер Блум.Обходя встречных, она подошла к витринам. Дэнис Брин в ветхом сюртуке и синих парусиновых туфлях, шаркая ногами, вышел из кафе Гаррисона, крепко прижимая к сердцу две толстенные книги. Словно с луны свалился. Ископаемое создание. Нисколько не удивившись ее появлению, он тут же очень серьезно принялся говорить, тыча вперед свою грязно-серую бороду и подрагивая отваливающейся челюстью.Мешуге[]. Совсем свихнувшийся.Мистер Блум продолжал свой путь легкой походкой, глядя, как впереди в лучах солнца мелькают туго обтянутый череп и болтающаяся плащезонтрость.Щеголь хоть куда. Полюбуйтесь! Опять вылез за тротуар. Еще один способ идти по жизни. И тот второй, тронутый волосан в отрепьях. Должно быть тяжко ей с ним приходится.К.К.: ку ку. Готов поклясться это Олф Берген или же Ричи Гулдинг[]. Спорю на что угодно они это выдумали для смеха, сидя в пивной Скотч хаус.Собрался в контору Ментона. Тот выпучит на открытку рачьи глаза. На галерке дикий восторг.Он миновал редакцию Айриш таймс. Может там новые ответы лежат. Хотел бы на все ответить. Удобная система для преступников. Шифр. Сейчас у них обед. Там клерк в очках, он не знает меня. Да ладно пусть полежат дозреют.И так хватило возни, сорок четыре уже пришло. Требуется опытная машинистка для помощи джентльмену в его литературных трудах. Я назвала тебя противным мой миленький потому что мне совсем не нравится тот свет. Пожалуйста объясни мне смысл. Пожалуйста напиши какими духами твоя жена. Объясни мне кто сотворил мир. У них манера закидывать тебя вопросами. А эта другая, Лиззи Твигг[]. Моим литературным опытам посчастливилось заслужить похвалу знаменитого поэта А.Э. (мистера Джор.Рассела). Некогда волосы как следует причесать, прихлебывает жидкий чай за книжкой стихов.Для небольших объявлений это лучшая газета, всем даст очко. Сейчас и в провинции закрепилась.

Миссис Мириэм Дэндрейд у которой я покупал ношеное белье черное и старые покрывала в отеле Шелборн. Разводка из Южной Америки. На ноготь не проявила смущения когда я копался в ее белье. Как будто я это мебель. Потом ее видел на приеме у вице-короля когда Стаббс королевский лесничий провел меня туда вместе с Хиланом из Экспресса[]. Доедали остатки после высшего общества.Плотный ужин. Я сливы там полил майонезом спутал с заварным кремом. У нее бы от стыда уши целый месяц горели. С такой надо быть не хуже быка.Прирожденная куртизанка.

В жизнь  через каторжные работы. Идеи насчет обезболивания: королеве Виктории применяли. Девять у нее было. Добрая несушка. Старушка в ботинке жила детей у ней куча была. Говорят у нее был туберкулез[]. Давно уж пора чтобы занялись этим, а не заливали бы про как там про серебристое лоно да задумчивое мерцание. Морочат головы дурачкам. А тут бы легко образовалось крупное дело полное обезболивание потом каждому новорожденному из налоговых сумм начисляется пять фунтов под сложные проценты до совершеннолетия пять процентов это будет сто шиллингов да те самые пять фунтов помножить на двадцать по десятичной системе подтолкнуло бы людей откладывать деньги сто десять и сколько-то еще до двадцати одного года это надо на бумаге выходит кругленькая сумма больше чем сразу кажется.Конечно не мертворожденным. Их даже не регистрируют. Потерянный труд.Забавное было зрелище, они обе рядом, животы выпячены. Молли и миссис Мойзел. Собрание матерей. Чахотка проходит на время а потом снова. Какими плоскими они вдруг кажутся после этого. Глядят умиротворенно. Бремя с души. Миссис Торнтон была милейшая старушка. Они все мои детки, так она говорила. Прежде чем их кормить, первую ложку себе в рот. У-у, да это просто ням-ням. Сын Тома Уолла изуродовал ей руку. Его первое приветствие публике. Голова с отборную тыкву. Старый ворчун доктор Моррен.

А врачи очень гуманные, почти все.Перед большими высокими дверями Ирландского парламента вспорхнула стая голубей. Резвятся после кормежки. Ну что, на кого б нам попробовать? Я вон на того, в черном. Так, пошел. Так, удачно. Должно быть, интересные ощущения, когда с воздуха. Эпджон, я и Оуэн Голдберг на деревьях возле Гус Грин, когда играли в мартышек[]. Они меня прозвали деляга.Отряд полиции показался с Колледж-стрит, следуя шеренгой в затылок.Гусиным шагом. Лица, разгоряченные плотной едой, пот из-под шлемов, помахивают дубинками. Только что поели, заправили под ремни по доброй порции супа. Как завидна судьба полисмена[]. Они разбились на группы и, отсалютовав, двинулись на свои посты. Отпустили пастись. Лучший момент для нападения  сразу же после пудинга. С правой прямо ему в обед. Еще один отряд, шагая вразброд, обогнул ограду колледжа Тринити, направляясь к полицейскому участку. Нацелились на кормушки. Готовьсь к атаке на кавалерию. Готовьсь к атаке на суп.Он перешел улицу под озороватым перстом Томми Мура[]. Правильно сделали, что поставили ему памятник над писсуаром: слияние вод. Для женщин тоже должны устроить такие места. А то забегают в кондитерские. Надо мол шляпку поправить. Нет на всем белом свете долины такой . Знаменитая песня Джулии Моркан[]. Сохранила голос до самого конца. А Майкл Болф был ее учитель, кажется?Он проводил взглядом широкую накидку последнего полицейского. С такими клиентами лучше не связываться. Джеку Пауэру дано коснуться тайн[]: папаша у него сыщик. Если парень заставил их понервничать при аресте, то уж потом в кутузке ему покажут райские кущи. Но в конце концов их тоже нельзя винить при такой работке какая им достается особенно молодым. В день когда Джо Чемберлен получал степень в Тринити тот конный полисмен уж отработал свое жалованье сполна. Уж тут ничего не скажешь! Как его конь за нами гремел копытами по Эбби-стрит! Счастье что я сообразил занырнуть к Маннингу, а то крупно бы влип. Но как он грохнулся, черт возьми. Наверняка раскроил себе череп о булыжники. Не стоило мне там путаться с этими медиками. Да с новичками из Тринити в квадратных шляпах. Сами на рожон лезут. Но зато познакомился с этим юношей, с Диксоном[], что потом мне в Скорбящей забинтовал ранку от укуса[]. Сейчас он на Холлс-стрит где миссис Пьюрфой.Колесо в колесе[]. До сих пор полицейские свистки в ушах. Все мигом наутек.Потому он ко мне и привязался. Вы задержаны. На этом вот месте и началось.

Подзуживал зеленых юнцов чтоб выведывать а сам все время за деньги работал на тайную полицию. Потом от него быстренько отделались. Понятно почему эти в штатском всегда обхаживают служанок. Легко заприметить человека привыкшего носить форму.Полюбезничает с ней у черного хода. Слегка потискает. А потом следующий номер программы. Скажи а кто этот господин что все захаживает сюда? А молодой хозяин что-нибудь говорил? Подглядывает в замочную скважину.Подсадная утка. Юный пылкий студент дурачится, вертится возле ее пухлых рук, пока она гладит. Это не твои, Мэри?

Устраиваются как у себя дома.А подайте-ка нам вон те абрикосы то бишь персики. Не за горами тот день.Солнце гомруля восходит на северо-западе.Он шел дальше, и улыбка тускнела на его лице, меж тем как тяжелое облако медленно наползало на солнце, закрывая тенью горделивый фасад Тринити. Катили в разные стороны трамваи, съезжаясь, разъезжаясь, трезвоня. Слова бесполезны. Ничего не меняется, изо дня в день: полицейские маршируют взад-вперед, трамваи туда-обратно. Те двое чудиков бродят по городу. Дигнам отдал концы. Майна Пьюрфой на койке с раздутым брюхом стонет чтоб из нее вытащили ребенка. Каждую секунду кто-то где-то рождается. Каждую секунду кто-нибудь умирает. Пять минут прошло как я кормил птиц. Три сотни сыграли в ящик. Другие три сотни народились, с них обмывают кровь, все омыты в крови агнца, блеют бееее.Исчезнет полгорода народу, появится столько же других, потом и эти исчезнут, следующие являются, исчезают. Дома, длинные ряды домов, улицы, мили мостовых, груды кирпича, камня. Переходят из рук в руки. Один хозяин, другой. Как говорится, домовладелец бессмертен. Один получил повестку съезжать  тут же на его место другой. Покупают свои владения на золото, а все золото все равно у них. Где-то тут есть обман. Сгрудились в городах и тянут веками канитель.

Как две капли воды. Это лицо всюду меня преследует. Совпадение, конечно. Сто раз бывает что думаешь о человеке и не встречаешь его. Идет как во сне. Никто не узнает его. Должно быть сегодня заседание в муниципалитете. Говорят за все время что он церемониймейстер ни разу мундира не надевал. А Чарли Болджер всегда выезжал на громадном коне, в треуголке, выбритый, напудренный и надутый.Какой у него удрученный вид. Яйцо тухлое съел. Мешки под глазами, как привидение. Я в таком горе. Брат великого человека: брат своего брата.Славно бы он выглядел на казенном скакуне. Наверняка улизнет в ДХК пить кофе да играть в шахматы. Для его брата люди были как пешки.

У них в роду все со сдвигом.Сумасшедшая Фанни и вторая сестра, миссис Дикинсон[], у которой лошади с красной упряжью. Держится прямо, в точности как хирург Макардл.

Может это Лиззи Твигг с ним. А.Э.: что бы это значило? Наверно инициалы. Альберт Эдвард[], Артур Эдмунд, Альфонс Эб Эд Эль Эсквайр. Что он такое нес? Концы света с шотландским акцентом. Щупальца, осьминог. Что-то оккультное  символизм. Разглагольствует. Этой-то все сойдет. Слова не скажет. Для помощи джентльмену в его литературных трудах.Глаза его проводили рослую фигуру в домотканой одежде, борода и велосипед, рядом внимающая женщина. Идут из вегетарианской столовой. Там фрукты одни да силос. Бифштекс ни-ни. Если съешь глаза этой коровы будут преследовать тебя до скончания всех времен. Уверяют так здоровей. А с этого одни газы да вода. Пробовал. Целый день только и бегаешь. Брюхо пучит как у обожравшейся овцы. Сны всю ночь снятся. Почему это они называют то чем меня кормили бобштекс? Бобрианцы. Фруктарианцы[]. Чтобы тебе показалось будто ты ешь ромштекс. Дурацкие выдумки. И пересолено. Готовят на соде. Просидишь у крана всю ночь.У ней чулки висят на лодыжках. Терпеть этого не могу: настолько безвкусно выглядит. Эта литературная публика, они все в облаках витают.Туманно эфирные символисты. Эстеты. Не удивлюсь если вдруг докажут что такой вот род пищи он как бы и рождает поэзию какие-то что ли волны в мозгу. Вот взять любого из тех полисменов у которых все рубахи в поту после бараньей похлебки: попробуй из него выжми хоть полстрочки стихов. Да он вообще не знает что такое стихи. Для этого нужен особый настрой.Туманно эфирная чайка,Куда твой полет, отвечай-ка!Он перешел улицу на углу Нассау-стрит и остановился перед витриной магазина Йейтс и сын, разглядывая цены биноклей. А может завернуть к Харрису, поболтать малость с молодым Синклером? Вот благовоспитанный юноша. Наверное обедает. Пора починить мои старые очки. Стекла фирмы Герц шесть гиней. Немцы пролезают всюду. Продают на льготных условиях чтобы захватить рынок. Сбивают цены. Может случайно повезет найти пару в бюро забытых вещей при вокзале. Поражаешься чего только люди не оставляют в раздевалках и поездах. О чем они думают? И женщины. Просто удивительно.Когда ехал в Эннис в прошлом году подобрал сумку что дочка того фермера позабыла и передал ей на пересадке в Лимерик. И за деньгами не являются.На крыше банка там у них маленькие часы чтобы проверять эти бинокли.Веки его приспустились до нижнего краешка зрачков. Нет, не вижу. Если представить их там тогда почти видишь. Все равно не вижу.Он повернулся к солнцу и, стоя между витринными навесами, вытянул в направлении к нему правую руку. Давно собирался попробовать. Так и есть: целиком. Кончик его мизинца закрыл весь солнечный диск. Должно быть тут фокус где сходятся все лучи. Жаль что нет темных очков. Интересно. Сколько было разговоров о пятнах на солнце когда мы жили на Ломбард-стрит. Эти пятна  это огромные взрывы. В этом году будет полное затмение: где-то в конце осени.Ну вот, как только я про это подумал так шар упал. Время по Гринвичу.Эти часы управляются по электрическим проводам из Дансинка[]. Стоило бы как-нибудь туда съездить в первую субботу месяца. Если бы получить рекомендацию к профессору Джоли или что-нибудь разузнать про его семью.Тоже должно подействовать: всегда приятно для самолюбия. Лесть где ее совершенно не ждешь. Аристократ гордится происхождением от любовницы короля. Достославная прародительница. Главное, налегай на лесть. Ласковое теля двух маток сосет. А не так, чтобы вошел и брякнул с порога то что сам знаешь не по твоей части: а что такое параллакс? Проводите-ка этого господина к выходу.Эх.Он бессильно уронил руку.Никогда об этом ничего не узнают. Пустая затрата времени. Газовые шары вращаются, сливаются, разлетаются. И так без конца эта карусель. Газ: потом твердые частицы: потом возникает мир: потом остывает: потом несется в пространстве одна мертвая оболочка, заледенелая корка, вроде ананасного леденца. Луна. Она сказала что сейчас новолуние. Кажется это верно.Он проходил мимо ателье   . Вот смотри. Полнолуние было в ту ночь когда мы в воскресенье две недели назад значит в точности сейчас новолуние. Шли по берегу Толки. Неплохо для лунной ночи в Фэрвью. Она напевала. Юный май и луна, как сияет она, о, любовь[]. Он рядом с ней, по другую сторону. Локоть, рука. Он. И в траве светлячок свой зажег огонек, о, любовь. Коснулись. Пальцы. Вопрос. Ответ.Да.Стоп. Стоп. Что было то было. Должно было.Мистер Блум  его дыхание участилось, а шаг замедлился  миновал Адам-корт.Понемногу уфф тихо не дури тихо успокаиваясь его глаза доносили это улица середина дня вислые плечи Боба Дорена. В своем ежегодном загуле, как сказал Маккой. Пьют чтоб выговориться или почудить или   .Погудят в Куме с дружками да с девками а потом весь остальной год как стеклышко.Ну да. Так я и думал. Нацелился в Эмпайр. Вошел. Ему бы самое лучшее чистой содовой. Там раньше был мюзик-холл Арфа Пэта Кинселлы до того как Уитбред стал управляющим в театре Куинз. Отличный малый.

В женской юбке, из-под которой длиннейшие красные подштанники. Сидели пьянчуги, пили, хохотали, брызжа слюной, захлебывались. Поддай жару, Пэт. Побагровелые  пьяная потеха  гогот и дым от курева. Сними-ка этот белый колпак. Глаза у него как ошпаренные. Где-то теперь он? Где-нибудь нищенствует. Арфа дивная голодом нас уморила[].Я был тогда счастливей. Хотя был ли это я? И сейчас я это я ли?Двадцать восемь мне было. Ей двадцать три. Когда переехали с Западной Ломбард-стрит что-то сломалось. После Руди никогда уже не получала от этого удовольствия. Времени не вернешь назад. Воду не удержишь в ладонях.А хотел бы? Вернуться назад. К самому началу. Хотел бы? Так ты несчастлив в семейной жизни, мой бедненький противный мальчишка? Хочет мне пуговицы пришивать. Надо ответить. Напишу ей в библиотеке.Грэфтон стрит яркопестрыми навесами дразнила чувства его. Набивной муслин, шелколеди, величественные матроны, звяканье сбруи и глухозвук стукопыт по раскаленным булыжникам. Какие толстые ноги у этой в белых чулках. Хорошо бы дождь их заляпал грязью как следует. Чистопородная деревенщина. Все толстомясые припожаловали. В таких у женщины всегда неуклюжие ноги. И у Молли не выглядят стройными.Беззаботной походкой он шел мимо витрин шелковой торговли Брауна Томаса. Водопады лент. Воздушные китайские шелка. Наклоненный сосуд струил потоком из своего разверстого зева кроваво-красный поплин: сверкающая кровь. Это сюда гугеноты завезли.[].    []! Тара-тара. Замечательный хор. Тара .

В занавесках иголки.Он слегка отвернул левый рукав. Царапина: уже почти зажила. Нет все-таки не сегодня. Еще ведь надо вернуться за тем лосьоном. А может на ее день рождения? Июниюль, авгусентябрь восьмое. Еще почти три месяца. А может это ей вовсе и не понравится. Женщины не любят подбирать булавки.Говорят оборвется лю.Блестящие шелка, нижние юбки на тонких медных прутах, шелковые чулки, разложенные расходящимися лучами.Что толку о старом. Так надо было.

В поцелуях, объятиях, все, всюду  среди высоких летних лугов, на перепутанной примятой траве, в сырых подъездах многоквартирных домов, на диванах, на скрипучих кроватях. Джек, милый! Ненаглядная! Поцелуй меня, Регги! Мой мальчик! Любимая!С неутихающим волнением в сердце он подошел к столовой Бертона и толкнул дверь. От удушливой вони перехватило дыхание. Пахучие соки мяса, овощная бурда.

Юноша с бледным лоснящимся лицом усердно стакан нож вилку ложку вытирает салфеткой. Новая порция микробов. Мужичина, заткнувши за воротник всю в пятнах соуса детскую салфетку, булькая и урча, в глотку ложками заправляет суп. Другой выплевывает назад на тарелку: хрящи не осилил  зубов нету разгрыгрыгрызть. Филе, жареное на угольях. Глотает кусками, спешит разделаться. Глаза печального пропойцы. Откусил больше чем может прожевать. И я тоже такой? Что видит взор его и прочих[]. Голодный всегда зол. Работают челюстями. Осторожно! Ох! Кость! В том школьном стихотворении Кормак последний ирландский король-язычник подавился и умер в Слетти к югу от Война[]. Интересно что он там ел. Что-нибудь этакое.Святой Патрик обратил его в христианство. Все равно целиком не смог проглотить. Ростбиф с капустой. Порцию тушеной баранины.Человечий дух. У него подступило к горлу. Заплеванные опилки, тепловатый и сладковатый дым сигарет, вонь от табачной жвачки, от пролитого пива, человечьей пивной мочи, перебродившей закваски.Я тут не смогу проглотить ни куска. Вон малый затачивает ножик об вилку готовый пожрать все что глаз видит, старик ковыряет в последних зубенках.Легкая отрыжка, сыт, пережевывает жвачку. До и после. Благодарственная молитва после еды.

Соль пропадает.Служитель в развязавшемся фартуке с грохотом собирал липкие тарелки.Рок, главный пристав, стоя у стойки, сдувал со своего пива пенистую корону. Отлично исполнил: она расплылась желтым у его сапога. Один из обедающих, поставив локти на стол, подняв вилку и нож, уставился поверх запятнанного листа газеты на подъемник с блюдами. Поджидает второе. А сосед ему что-то рассказывает с набитым ртом. Сочавственный слушатель.Застольная беседа. Чавчавстенько встречав-чавкаемся по чавк-вергам. А? Да неужто?Мистер Блум в нерешительности приложил два пальца к губам. Взгляд его говорил: Не здесь. Не вижу его.Прочь. Не выношу свиней за столом.Он попятился к двери. Лучше перекусить у Дэви Берна. Сойдет чтобы заморить червячка. На какое-то время хватит. Завтрак был плотный. Мне бифштекс с картошкой. Пинту портера.Тут каждый сам за себя, зубами и ногтями. Глотай. Кусай. Глотай.

С Эйлсбери-роуд, с Клайд-роуд, из ремесленных кварталов, из северной богадельни, лорд-мэр в роскошной карете, дряхлая королева в кресле на колесиках. У меня пустая тарелка. Я за вами, вот моя казенная чашка. Как у фонтана сэра Филипа Крэмптона[]. Микробов смахивайте платком.Следующий натрясет своим новую кучу. Отец ОФлинн их на смех всех поднял в тот же миг. Устраивают свары. Каждый лезет вперед. Детишки подрались кому выскребать котел. Суповой котел тут нужен величиной с Феникс-парк. И гарпуном из него добывать цельные четверти туш и бока солонины. Ненавидят всех кто вокруг. В гостинице Городской герб она это называла табльдот.Суп, жаркое, десерт. Никогда не знаешь чьи мысли пережевываешь. А кто будет мыть потом все тарелки и вилки? Может к тому времени все начнут питаться таблетками. Зубы все хуже будут и хуже.По сути вегетарианцы во многом правы что из земли растет все то вкусней и полезней конечно от чеснока воняет итальянцами-шарманщиками, хрусткий лук грибы трюфли. И потом ведь животные страдают. Птицу надо ощипать выпотрошить. Бедная скотина на рынке дожидается пока ей раскроят череп.Му у. Несчастные дрожащие телята. Ме-е. Валкие телки. Жаркое из телятины с овощами. В ведрах у мясников колышутся легкие. Подайте-ка вон ту грудину что на крюке. Плюх. Кровавая жуть. Освежеванные овцы с остекленелыми глазами свисают подвешенные за окорока, овечьи морды обернуты окровавленной бумагой, кровавые сопли капают с носов на опилки. Осердье и требуху выносят. Поосторожней с теми кусками молодой человек.При чахотке прописывают свежую еще теплую кровь. Всегда нужна кровь.Подстерегающие. Лизать ее жаркодымящуюся густоприторную. Алчущие призраки[].Ох как проголодался.Он вошел к Дэви Берну. Вполне пристойное заведение. Он не болтлив.Бывает и поднесет стаканчик. Но это если год високосный, не чаще чем раз в четыре. Однажды обменял мне чек на наличные.Чего бы взять в такое время? Он вынул часы. Давай сообразим. Имбирного лимонаду с пивом? Привет, Блум,  сказал Флинн Длинный Нос, сидевший в своем углу[]. Привет, Флинн. Как дела? Полный порядок Надо сообразить. Возьму стаканчик бургонского и еще надо сообразить.Сардины на полках. Посмотришь и уже ощущение вкуса. Сандвич? Ветчинкер и сыновья с горчицей и с хлебом. Паштет. Как живется в доме без паштетов Сливи? Ну и дурацкая реклама! И дали прямо под некрологами. Вот уж точно тоскливо. Паштет из Дигнама. Для людоедов, с рисом и ломтиками лимона.Белых миссионеров не едят, слишком солоны. Как острого засола свинина. Я думаю вождю выделяются почетные части. Жестковаты наверно от усиленных упражнений. Все жены собрались вокруг смотрят что будет. Как-то раз негритянский царек. Кушал патера в летний денек . А с ними жизнь словно рай. Ну и намешали всего. Хрящик горло требуха и гнилые потроха вместе навалено и мелко нарублено. Загадочная картинка: найдите мясо. Кошер.Молоко и мясо вместе нельзя. Теперь то же самое называется гигиена. Пост Йом Кипур: весенняя чистка внутренностей[]. Война и мир зависят от чьего-то пищеварения. Религии. Индейки и гуси на Рождество. Избиение младенцев. Ешь пей и веселись. А потом толпы в приемный покой за помощью. Головы перевязаны: сыр все переваривает кроме себя самого[]. Был сух стал сыр. У вас есть сандвичи с сыром? Да, сэр.И хорошо бы немного маслин, если есть у них. Лучше всего итальянские.Добрым стаканом бургонского все запить. Пойдет как по маслу. Том Кернан отлично готовит. Салат всегда на чистом оливковом масле. Свеженький как огурчик. Старается. Милли мне подала отбивную с веточкой петрушки.Добавить одну луковицу. Бог создал пищу, а дьявол поваров[]. Краб по-дьявольски. Жена здорова? Спасибо, вполне Так значит сандвич с сыром. У вас есть горгонзола? Да, сэр.Длинный Нос потягивал свой грог. Случается ей петь последнее время?Поглядеть только на его губы. Мог бы сам себе насвистывать в ухо. И уши лопухами, под стать. Музыка. Он в ней понимает как свинья в апельсинах. Но при всем том, стоит ему расписать. Вреда не будет. Даровая реклама. В этом месяце у нее ангажемент на большое турне. Возможно, вы уже слышали. Нет, не слыхал. Ну, это шикарно. А кто это устраивает?Принесли заказ. Сколько с меня? Семь пенсов, сэр Благодарю, сэр.Мистер Блум разрезал свой сандвич на тонкие ломтики. Летний денек .Так то проще чем в их туманно-кефирном стиле. Он кой-что проглотил и подъем ощутил . Горчицы не угодно ли, сэр? Да, спасибо.Он усеял каждый ломтик желтыми каплями. Подъем ощутил . Ага, готово. И кой-чем он достал потолок. Устраивает?  переспросил он.  Вы знаете, дело задумано на паях.Совместное участие в прибылях и издержках. А, припоминаю теперь,  сказал Длинный Нос, запустив себе руку в карман и почесывая в паху.  Кто же мне это говорил? И кажется, с этим связан Буян Бойлан?Жар от горчицы теплым толчком заставил вздрогнуть сердце мистера Блума.Он поднял глаза и увидел, как на него желчно уставился циферблат. Два. В трактирах на пять минут вперед. Время идет. Часы тикают. Два. Пока еще нет.В груди у него что-то тоскливо поднялось, потом упало, опять поднялось тоскливо, тоскующе.Вина.Он посмаковал благотворную влагу и, резко приказав горлу отправить ее, аккуратным движением поставил стакан. Да,  сказал он.  Действительно, это он организатор.Риска нет: мозгов нет.Длинный Нос сопел и почесывался. Блоха за хорошим плотным обедом. Джек Муни мне говорил, он цапнул хороший куш на боксерском матче[], когда Майлер Кео победил того солдатика в Портобельских казармах. Он малыша этого держал в графстве Карлоу, ей-богу, так он мне говорилНадеюсь, эта капля росы не упадет прямо ему в стакан. Нет, втянул обратно. Почти что месяц держал, смекаете, до самого матча. И чтоб одни сырые утиные яйца ел, ей-богу, пока не будет распоряжений. А выпивки чтоб ни капли, это подумать, а? Ну, Буян  дошлый мужик, ей-богу.Из двери за стойкой появился Дэви Берн в рубашке с засученными рукавами, утирая губы салфеткой. Румяная серость. Улыбка радости играет на его  каком-то там  лице[]. Сверх меры елейно-масляный. Сыт, пьян и нос в табаке,  приветствовал его Флинн.  Вы нам не подскажете ставочку на Золотой кубок? Я этим не занимаюсь, мистер Флинн,  отвечал Дэви Берн.  Никогда не ставлю ни единого гроша. И правильно делаете,  сказал Флинн Длинный Нос.Мистер Блум поглощал ломтики сандвича, свежий, тонкого помола хлеб, испытывая небесприятное отвращение от жгучей горчицы и зеленого сыра, пахнущего ногами. Вино освежало и смягчало во рту. Нет вяжущего привкуса.В такую погоду у него лучше букет, когда не холодно.Приятное спокойное место. Красивая деревянная панель на стойке.Красивые линии. Нравится это закругление. И ни за что бы не стал этим заниматься,  продолжал Дэви Берн.  Эти самые лошадки уже стольких пустили по миру.У трактирщика своя ставка. Патент на торговлю в розлив пивом, вином и крепкими. Орел  я выигрываю, решка  ты проиграл. Как есть истина,  подтвердил Длинный Нос.  Если только ты не в сговоре. Честного спорта теперь не сыщешь. Иногда Ленехан подсказывает верные ставки. Сегодня советует на Корону. А фаворит  Мускат, лорда Хауарда де Уолдена, выиграл в Эпсоме. Жокей  Морни Кэннон. Две недели назад я мог получить семь к одному, если б поставил на Сент-Аманту. Да неужели?  сказал Дэви Берн.Он отошел к окну и, взяв расчетную книжку, принялся ее листать. Вот те крест, мог,  говорил Длинный Нос, сопя.  Просто редкостная кобылка. От Сент-Фрускена, хозяин  Ротшильд. Выиграла в самую грозу, уши заткнули ей. Голубой камзол и желтый картуз. Да тут черт принес Бена Долларда верзилу с его Джоном ОГонтом. Он меня и отговорил. И пропало.Сокрушенно он прихлебнул из стакана, побарабанил по нему пальцами. Пропало,  повторил с тяжким вздохом.Не переставая жевать, мистер Блум созерцал его вздох. Вот уж где олух царя небесного. Сказать ему на какую лошадь Ленехан? Знает уже. Лучше бы позабыл. Пойдет, еще больше проиграет. У дурака деньги не держатся. Снова капля повисла. Как бы это он целовал женщину со своим насморком. Хотя может им это нравится. Нравится же когда колючая борода. У собак мокрые носы. В гостинице Городской герб у старой миссис Риордан был скай-терьер, у которого вечно бурчало в брюхе. Молли его ласкала у себя на коленях. Ах ты собачка, ты мой гавгавгавчик!Вино пропитывало и размягчало склеившуюся массу из хлеба горчицы какой-то момент противного сыра. Отличное вино. Лучше его чувствуешь когда не хочется пить. Конечно это ванна так действует. Ладно слегка перекусили.Потом можно будет часов в шесть. Шесть. Шесть. Тогда же будет все. Она.Вино мягким огнем растекалось по жилам. Мне так не хватало этого.Совсем было сник. Глаза его неголодно оглядывали полки с жестянками: сардины, яркие клешни омаров. Каких только диковин не приспособили в пищу.Из раковин моллюсков шпилькой, с деревьев, улиток из земли французы едят, из моря на крючок с приманкой. Тупая рыба в тысячу лет ничему не научится.Если заранее не знаешь опасно отправлять в рот что попало. Ядовитые ягоды.Боярышник. Округлость всегда привлекательна. А яркая окраска отпугивает.Один предупредит другого и так далее. Сначала испробовать на собаке.Привлекает запахом или видом. Искусительный плод. Мороженое в стаканчиках.Сливки. Инстинкт. Те же апельсиновые плантации. Нужно искусственное орошение. Бляйбтройштрассе. А как же тогда устрицы. Мерзкий вид. Как густой плевок. Грязные раковины. Вдобавок чертовски трудно открыть. Кто их придумал есть? И кормятся разной дрянью, в сточных водах. Шампанское и устрицы с Ред бэнк. Имеет сексуальный эффект. Афроди. Он был сегодня утром в Ред бэнк. Может устрицы не станет жалкий омлет небось в постели атлет да нет в июне ни устриц ни буквы эр. Но есть и кто любят этакое. Дичь с душком. Заяц в горшке. За двумя зайцами погонишься. Китайцы едят яйца которым полсотню лет уже стали сине-зеленые. Обеды из тридцати блюд.Каждое по отдельности безвредно а может когда смешается. Идея для детектива с отравлением. Кто это был кажется эрцгерцог Леопольд. Нет не он нет он или это был Отто который из Габсбургов[]? Словом кто это был который имел привычку поедать перхоть с собственной головы? Самый дешевый завтрак в городе. Конечно аристократы а потом остальные подражают чтоб не отстать от моды. Милли тоже нефть и мука. Сырое тесто я сам люблю. Из пойманных устриц половину выкидывают обратно чтобы не сбить цену. Будет дешево, никто не купит. Икра. Разыгрывают из себя вельмож. Рейнвейн в зеленых бокалах. Роскошный кутеж. Леди такая-то. Шея напудрена, жемчуга. .   []. Требуют особенных блюд, чтоб показать какие сами. Отшельник с горсткой бобов умерить искушения плоти. Хочешь меня узнать поешь со мной. Королевская осетрина. Как указано начальнику полиции, мяснику Коффи дано право торговать олениной из лесов его сият. Полтуши обязан отсылать ему. Я видел как готовили для банкета на кухне королевского архивариуса. Шеф-повар в белом колпаке как раввин. Утку поливали коньяком и поджигали. Савойская капуста     [].Хочешь знать что ты ел непременно надо меню где все было бы написано. Если валишь все в смесь то нельзя будет есть. По себе знаю. Навалил бульонных кубиков Эдвардса. Гусей для них раскармливают до одурения. Омаров варят живьем. Гекомендую вам попгобуйте этой кугопатки. Я бы не отказался официантом в шикарном отеле. Чаевые, вечерние туалеты, полуобнаженные дамы. Вы не отведали бы кусочек этого угря, мисс Дюбеда? О, я бы да. Ясно она бы да. Надо полагать гугенотская фамилия. Помнится, какая-то мисс Дюбеда жила в Киллини. Дю де ля это во французском. Но рыбка-то та же самая может из улова старого Мики Хэнлона с Мур-стрит что лезет из кожи наживая деньгу сам ловит сам потрошит а расписаться на чеке для него такой труд такую состроит мину будто шедевр живописи должен создать.Мэаикраткоекэлэ А Ха. Туп как чурбан, и пятьдесят тысяч капиталу.Бились об оконное стекло две мухи, жужжали, бились.Жар вина на его небе еще удерживался проглоченного. Давят на винокурне бургундский виноград. Это в нем солнечный жар. Как коснулось украдкой мне говорит вспоминается. Прикосновением разбуженные его чувства увлажненные вспоминали. Укрывшись под папоротниками на мысе Хоут под нами спящий залив: небо. Ни звука. Небо. У Львиной Головы цвет моря темно-лиловый.Зеленый у Драмлека. Желто-зеленый к Саттону. Подводные заросли, в траве слегка виднеются темные линии, затонувшие города. Ее волосы лежали как на подушке на моем пальто, я подложил руку ей под затылок жучки в вереске щекотали руку ах ты все на мне изомнешь. Какое чудо! Ее душистая нежно-прохладная рука касалась меня, ласкала, глаза на меня смотрели не отрываясь. В восторге я склонился над ней, ее полные губы раскрылись, я целовал их. Ум-м. Мягким движением она подсунула ко мне в рот печенье с тмином, которое она жевала. Теплая противная масса, которую пережевывал ее рот, кисло-сладкая от ее слюны. Радость: я глотал ее: радость. Юная жизнь, выпятив губки, она прильнула ими к моим. Губы нежные теплые клейкие как душистый лукум. Глаза ее были как цветы, глаза, полные желания, возьми меня. Невдалеке посыпались камешки. Она не пошевелилась. Коза. Больше никого. Высоко в рододендронах Бен Хоута разгуливала как дома коза, роняя свои орешки. Скрытая папоротниками она смеялась в горячих объятиях. Лежа на ней, я целовал ее неистово и безумно: ее глаза, губы, ее открытую шею где билась жилка, полные женские груди под тонкой шерстяной блузкой, твердые соски глядящие вверх. Целуя, я касался ее своим горячим языком.Она целовала меня. Я получал поцелуи. Уже вся поддаваясь она ерошила мои волосы. Осыпаемая моими поцелуями, целовала меня.Меня. И вот я теперь.Бились, жужжали мухи.Опустив глаза вниз, он проследил взглядом безмолвные линии прожилок на дубовой панели. Красота: линии закругляются: округлость это и есть красота. Совершенные формы богинь, Венера, Юнона: округлости, которыми восхищается весь мир. Можно посмотреть на них, библиотечный музей, стоят в круглом холле, обнаженные богини. Способствует пищеварению. Им все равно кто смотрит. На всеобщее обозрение. Никогда не заговорят. По крайней мере с таким как флинн. А допустим она вдруг как Галатея с Пигмалионом что она первое сказала бы? О, смертный! Знай свое место. Вкушать нектар с богами за трапезой золотые блюда амброзия. Не то что наши грошовые завтраки, вареная баранина, морковка и свекла, да бутылка пива. Нектар представь себе что пьешь электричество: пища богов. Прелестные женские формы изваяния Юноны. Бессмертная красота. А мы заталкиваем себе еду в дырку, входная спереди, выходная сзади: еда, кишечные соки, кровь, кал, земля, еда: без этого мы не можем как без топлива паровоз. А у них нет. Не приходило в голову посмотреть. Посмотрю сегодня. Хранитель не заметит.Что нибудь выроню и нагнусь. Погляжу есть ли у нее.Из его мочевого пузыря просочился неслышный сигнал пойти сделать не делать там сделать. Как мужчина в готовности, он осушил свой стакан до дна и вышел, они отдаются и смертным, влекутся к мужскому, ложатся с любовниками-мужчинами, юноша наслаждался с нею, во двор.Когда затих звук его шагов, Дэви Берн от своей книги спросил: А что он такое? Он не в страховом бизнесе? Это дело он давно бросил,  отозвался Флинн Длинный Нос.  Сейчас он рекламный агент во Фримене. На вид-то я его хорошо знаю,  сказал Дэви Берн.  У него что, несчастье? Несчастье?  удивился флинн Длинный Нос.  В первый раз слышу. А почему? Я заметил, он в трауре. Разве?  спросил Флинн Длинный Нос.  А ведь верно, ей-ей. Я у него спросил, как дела дома. Убей бог, ваша правда. В трауре. Я никогда не завожу разговор об этом,  сказал человеколюбиво Дэви Берн,  если вижу, что у джентльмена такое несчастье. Им это только лишний раз напоминает. Точно, что это не жена,  сказал флинн Длинный Нос.  Я его встретил позавчера на Генри-стрит, он как раз выходил из молочной Ирландская ферма, где торгует жена Джона Уайза Нолана, и нес в руках банку сливок для своей драгоценной половины. Она отлично упитанна, я вам доложу. Пышногрудая птичка. А он, значит, трудится во Фримене?  сказал Дэви Берн.Флинн Длинный Нос значительно поджал губы. С рекламок, что он добывает, на сливки не заработаешь. Можете всем ручаться. Это как же так?  спросил Дэви Берн, оставив свою книжку и подходя ближе.Флинн Длинный Нос проделал пальцами в воздухе несколько быстрых пассов фокусника. И подмигнул глазом. Он принадлежит к ложе,  промолвил он. Это вы что, серьезно?  спросил Дэви Берн. Серьезней некуда,  сказал Длинный Нос.  К древнему, свободному и признанному братству[]. Свет, жизнь и любовь, во как. И они его всячески поддерживают. Мне это сказал один, э-э, не важно кто. Но это факт? У, да это отличное братство,  сказал Длинный Нос.  Они вас никогда не оставят в беде. Я знаю одного парня, который к ним пытался попасть, но только к ним попробуй-ка попади. Скажем, женщин они вообще не допускают, и правильно делают, ей-богу.Дэви Берн единым разом улыбнулсязевнулкивнул: Иииааааааахх! Как-то одна женщина,  продолжал Длинный Нос,  спряталась в часы подсмотреть, чем они занимаются. Но, будь я проклят, они как-то ее учуяли и тут же на месте заставили дать присягу Мастеру ложи. Она была из рода Сент-Леже Донерайль[].Дэви Берн, еще со слезами на глазах после сладкого зевка, сказал недоверчиво: Но все-таки факт ли это? Он такой скромный, приличный. Я его часто тут вижу и ни одного разу не было, чтобы он  ну знаете, что-то себе позволил. Сам Всемогущий его не заставит напиться,  энергично подтвердил Длинный Нос.  Как чует, уже по-крупному загудели, тут же смывается. Не заметили, как он посмотрел на часы? Хотя да, вас не было. Его позовешь выпить, так он первое что сделает, это вытащит свои часы и по времени решит, чего ему надо принять внутрь. Всегда так делает, вот те крест. Бывают некоторые такие,  сказал Дэви Берн.  Но он человек надежный, вот что я вам скажу. Мужик неплохой,  опять согласился Длинный Нос, шмыгнув носом.  Про него знают, что он и кошельком поможет при случае. Каждому надо по заслугам. Без спору, есть у Блума хорошее. Но вот одну штуку он ни за что не сделает.Его рука изобразила как бы росчерк пера подле стакана с грогом. Я знаю,  сказал Дэви Берн. Черным по белому  ни за что[],  сказал Длинный Нос.Вошли Падди Леонард и Бэнтам Лайонс. Следом появился Том Рочфорд, поглаживая по бордовому жилету ладонью. Почтение, мистер Берн. Почтение, джентльмены. Они остановились у стойки. Кто ставит?  спросил Падди Леонард. Как кто, не знаю, а я на мели,  ответил Флинн Длинный Нос. Ладно, чего берем?  спросил Падди Леонард. Я возьму имбирный напиток,  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс. Чего-чего?  воскликнул Падди Леонард.  Это с каких же пор, мать честная? А ты, Том? Как там канализация работает?  спросил Флинн Длинный Нос, прихлебывая.Вместо ответа Том Рочфорд прижал руку к груди и громко икнул. Вас не затруднит дать стаканчик воды, мистер Берн?  попросил он. Сию минуту, сэр.Падди Леонард оглядел своих собутыльников. Ну и дела пошли,  сказал он.  Вы только полюбуйтесь, чему я выпивку ставлю. Вода и имбирная шипучка. И это парни, которые слизали б виски с волдыря на ноге. Вот у этого за пазухой какая-то чертова лошадка на Золотой кубок. Удар без промаха. Мускат, что ли?  спросил Флинн Длинный Нос.Том Рочфорд высыпал в свой стакан какой-то порошок из бумажки. Проклятый желудок,  сказал он перед тем, как выпить. Сода хорошо помогает,  посоветовал Дэви Берн.Том Рочфорд кивнул и выпил. Так что, Мускат? Я молчу!  подмигнул Бэнтам Лайонс.  Сам на это дело пускаю кровные пять шиллингов. Да скажи нам, если ты человек, и черт с тобой,  сказал Падди Леонард.  Сам-то ты от кого узнал?Мистер Блум, направляясь к выходу, поднял приветственно три пальца. До скорого!  сказал Флинн Длинный Нос.Остальные обернулись. Вот это он самый, от кого я узнал,  прошептал Бэнтам Лайонс. Тьфу,  произнес с презрением Падди Леонард.  Мистер Берн, сэр, так значит, вы дайте нам два маленьких виски Джеймсон и И имбирный напиток,  любезно закончил Дэви Берн. Вот-вот,  сказал Падди Леонард.  Бутылочку с соской для младенца.Мистер Блум шагал в сторону Доусон-стрит, тщательно прочищая языком зубы. Верно что-то зеленое: вроде шпината. С помощью рентгеновских лучей можно бы.На Дьюк лейн прожорливый терьер вырыгнул на булыжники тошнотворную жвачку из косточек и хрящей и с новым жаром набросился на нее.Неумеренность в пище. С благодарностью возвращаем, полностью переварив содержимое. Сначала десерт потом оно же закуска. Мистер Блум предусмотрительно обошел. Жвачные животные. Это ему на второе. Они двигают верхней челюстью. Интересно сумеет ли Том Рочфорд что-нибудь провернуть с этим своим изобретением. Зря трудится втолковывая этому Флинну ему бы только в глотку залить. У тощего мужика глотка велика. Должны устроить специальный зал или другое место где изобретатели могли б на свободе изобретать. Правда конечно туда бы все чокнутые сбежались.Он стал напевать, удлиняя торжественным эхом последние ноты каждого такта: ,   [].Получше стало. Бургонское. Славно подняло самочувствие. Кто первый начал вино гнать? Какой-нибудь сердяга впавший в тоску. Пьяная удаль.Сейчас надо в национальную библиотеку за этой Килкенни пипл. Сияющие чистотой унитазы, ждущие своего часа, в витрине Уильяма Миллера: оборудование для ванн и уборных,  вернули прежний ход его мыслям. Да, это могли бы: и проследить весь путь, иногда проглоченная иголка выходит где-нибудь из ребер через несколько лет, путешествует по всему телу изменяется желчные протоки селезенка брызжет печень желудочный сок кольца кишок как резиновые трубки. Вот только горемычному старикашке пришлось бы все это время стоять, выставив нутро напоказ. Ради науки.   .Что бы это значило . Наверно сегодня вечером.О дон Жуан, меня ты пригласилПрийти на ужин сегодня вечеромТа рам тара-там.Нескладно выходит.Ключчи: если уговорю Наннетти на два месяца. Это будет примерно два фунта десять или два фунта восемь. Три мне должен Хайнс. Два одиннадцать.Реклама для Прескотта: два пятнадцать. Итого около пяти гиней.

Чем плохо бы  по английским морским курортам?Брайтон, Маргейт. Гавань при свете луны. Ее голос плывет над водой. Те приморские красотки. Напротив пивной Джона Лонга сонно привалился к стене бродяга, в тяжком раздумье кусая коростовые костяшки пальцев. Мастер на все руки ищет работу. За скромное вознаграждение. Неприхотлив в еде.Мистер Блум повернул за угол у витрины кондитерской Кэтрин Грэй с нераскупленными тортами и миновал книжный магазин преподобного Томаса Коннеллана. Почему я порвал с католической церковью[]. Птичье гнездышко.Женщины там заправляют всем. Говорят во время неурожая на картошку они подкармливали супом детей бедняков, чтобы переходили в протестанты. А подальше там общество куда папа ходил, по обращению в христианство бедных евреев. Одна и та же приманка. Почему мы порвали с католической церковью.Слепой юноша стоял у края тротуара, постукивая по нему тонкой палкой.Трамвая не видно. Хочет перейти улицу. Вы хотите перейти?  спросил мистер Блум.Слепой не ответил. Его неподвижное лицо слабо дрогнуло. Он неуверенно повернул голову. Вы на Доусон-стрит,  сказал мистер Блум.  Перед вами Моулсворт-стрит. Вы хотите перейти? Сейчас путь свободен.Палка, подрагивая, подалась влево. Мистер Блум поглядел туда и снова увидел фургон красильни, стоящий у Парижской парикмахерской Дрейго. Где я и увидел его напомаженную шевелюру как раз когда я. Понурая лошадь. Возчик  у Джона Лонга. Промочить горло. Там фургон,  сказал мистер Блум,  но он стоит на месте. Я вас провожу через улицу. Вам нужно на Моулсворт-стрит? Да,  ответил юноша.  На Южную Фредерик-стрит. Пойдемте,  сказал мистер Блум.Он осторожно коснулся острого локтя  затем взял мягкую ясновидящую руку, повел вперед.Сказать ему что-нибудь. Только не разыгрывать сочувствие. Они не верят словам. Что-нибудь самое обыкновенное. Дождь прошел стороной.Никакого ответа.Пиджак его в пятнах. Наверно не умеет как следует есть. Все вкусы он чувствует по-другому. Кормить приходилось сначала с ложечки. Ручка как у ребенка. Как раньше у Милли. Чуткая. Я думаю он может представить мои размеры по моей руке. А интересно имя у него есть. Фургон. Палка чтоб не задела лошади за ноги скотинка притомилась пусть дремлет. Так. Все как надо. Быка обходи сзади  лошадь спереди. Спасибо, сэр.Знает что я мужчина. По голосу. Все в порядке? Теперь первый поворот налево.Слепой нащупал палкой край тротуара и продолжал путь, занося палку и постукивая ею перед собой.Мистер Блум следовал позади, за незрячими стопами и мешковатым твидовым костюмом в елочку. Бедный мальчик! Но каким же чудом он знал что там этот фургон? Стало быть как-то чувствовал. Может у них какое-то зрение во лбу: как бы некоторое чувство объема. Веса. А интересно почувствует он если что-нибудь убрать. Чувство пустоты. Какое у него должно быть странное представление о Дублине из этого постукивания по камням. А смог бы он идти по прямой, если без палки? Смиренное и бескровное лицо как у того кто готовится стать священником.Пенроуз! Вот как фамилия того парня.Смотри сколько разных вещей они могут делать. Читать пальцами. Настраивать рояли. А мы удивляемся что у них есть какой-то разум. Любой калека или горбун нам сразу кажется умным едва он что-то скажет что мы бы сами могли. Конечно другие чувства обостряются. Могут вышивать. Плести корзины. Люди должны им помогать. Положим я бы подарил Молли корзинку для рукоделья ко дню рождения. А она терпеть не может шитья. Еще рассердится.Темные, так их называют.И обоняние у них наверное сильней. Запахи со всех сторон, слитые вместе. У каждой улицы свой запах. У каждого человека тоже. Затем весна, лето: запахи. А вкусы? Говорят вкус вина не почувствуешь с закрытыми глазами или когда простужен. И если куришь в темноте говорят нет того удовольствия.А скажем с женщинами. Меньше стыда если не видишь. Вон проходит девчонка, задравши нос, мимо Института Стюарта. Глядите-ка на меня. Вот она я, при всех доспехах. Должно быть это странно если не видишь ее. В воображении у него есть какое-то понятие о форме. Голос, разность температур когда он касается ее пальцами должен почти уже видеть очертания, округлости. К примеру, он проводит рукой по ее волосам.Допустим, у нее черные. Отлично. Назовем это черным. Потом он гладит ее белую кожу. Наверно другое ощущение. Ощущение белого.Почта. Надо ответить. Чистая волынка сегодня. Послать ей перевод на два шиллинга или на полкроны. Прими от меня маленький подарок. Вот и писчебумажный магазин рядом. Погоди. Сначала подумаю.Легкими и очень медленными касаниями его пальцы осторожно пощупали волосы, зачесанные назад над ушами. Еще раз. Как тонкие-претонкие соломинки. Затем, столь же легко касаясь, он пощупал кожу у себя на правой щеке. Тут тоже пушистые волоски. Не совсем гладкая. Самая гладкая на животе. Вокруг никого. Только тот поворачивает на Фредерик-стрит. Не иначе, настраивать рояль в танцевальных классах Левенстона. Может быть, это я поправляю подтяжки.Проходя мимо трактира Дорена, он быстро просунул руку между брюками и жилетом и, оттопырив слегка рубашку, пощупал вялые складки на своем животе. Но я же знаю что он беловатый желтый. Надо посмотреть что будет если в темноте.Он вытащил руку и оправил свою одежду.Бедняга! Еще совсем мальчик. Это ужасно. Действительно ужасно. Какие у него могут быть сны, у незрячего? Для него жизнь сон. Где же справедливость если ты родился таким? Все эти женщины и дети что сгорели и потонули в Нью-Йорке во время морской прогулки[]. Гекатомба. Это называется карма такое переселение за твои грехи в прошлой жизни перевоплощение метим псу хвост. Боже мой. Боже, Боже. Жаль конечно  но что-то такое есть почему с ними нельзя по-настоящему сблизиться.Сэр Фредерик Фолкинер[] входит в здание масонской ложи. Важный как Трои[].Успел плотно позавтракать у себя на Эрлсфорт-террас. Со старыми приятелями-судейскими изрядно заложили за воротник. Истории о судах и выездных сессиях, рассказы про синемундирную школу[]. И отвесил я ему десять годиков. Я думаю он бы только скривился от того вина что я пил. Для них из фирменных погребов, бутылки пыльные, на каждой поставлен год. У него есть свои понятия о том что такое справедливость в суде. Старикан с добрыми побуждениями. Полицейские сводки битком набиты делами, это они натягивают себе проценты, фабрикуют преступления из любых пустяков. А он им все такие дела заворачивает обратно. Гроза для ростовщиков. Рувима Дж. уж совсем смешал с грязью. А что, тому только по заслугам если его назовут грязным жидом. Большая власть у судей. Старые сварливые пьяницы в париках. Смотрит зверем. И да помилует Господь твою душу.Гляди, афиша. Благотворительный базар Майрас. Его сиятельство генерал-губернатор. Шестнадцатого. Значит, сегодня. В пользу больницы Мерсера[]. Первое исполнение Мессии было в пользу этой больницы. Да.Гендель. А может сходить туда: Боллсбридж. Заглянуть к Ключчи. Да нет, не стоит уж так приставать к нему. Только отношения портить. Наверняка при входе кто-нибудь попадется знакомый.Мистер Блум вышел на Килдер-стрит. Сюда первым делом. В библиотеку.Соломенная шляпа блеснула на солнце. Рыжие штиблеты. Брюки с манжетами.Так и есть. Так и есть.Его сердце дрогнуло мягко. Направо. Музей. Богини. Он повернул направо.А точно? Почти уверен. Не буду смотреть. У меня лицо красное от вина.Что это я? Чересчур помчался. Да, так и есть. Шагом. И не смотреть. Не смотреть. Идти.Приближаясь к воротам музея размашистым и нетвердым шагом, он поднял глаза. Красивое здание. По проекту сэра Томаса Дина[]. Он не идет за мной?Может быть не заметил меня. Солнце ему в глаза.Его дыхание стало коротким и прерывистым. Быстрей. Прохладные статуи: там спокойствие. Еще минута и я спасен. Нет, он меня не заметил. После двух. У самых ворот.Как бьется сердце!Его зрачки пульсируя неотрывно смотрели на кремовые завитки камня. Сэр Томас Дин был греческая архитектура.Ищу что то я.Торопливую руку сунул быстро в карман, вынул оттуда, прочел, не разворачивая, Агендат Нетаим. Куда же я?Беспокойно ища.Быстро сунул обратно Агендат.Она сказала после полудня.Я ищу это. Да, это. Смотри во всех карманах. Носовой, Фримен. Куда же я? Ах, да. В брюках. Картофелина. Кошелек. Куда?Спеши. Иди спокойно. Еще момент. Как бьется сердце.Рука его искавшая тот куда же я сунул нашла в брючном кармане кусок мыла лосьон забрать теплая обертка прилипшее Ага мыло тут я да. Ворота.Спасен!Эпизод []Деликатно их успокаивая, квакер-библиотекарь вполголоса ворковал: И ведь у нас есть, не правда ли, эти бесценные страницы Вильгельма Мейстера[]. Великий поэт  про своего великого собрата по ремеслу.Колеблющаяся душа, что в смертной схватке с целым морем бед, терзаемая сомнениями и противоречиями, как это бывает в реальной жизни.Он выступил на шаг вперед в контрдансе скрипнув воловьей кожей и на шаг назад в контрдансе по торжественному паркету он отступил[].Безмолвный помощник, приотворив осторожно дверь, сделал ему безмолвный знак. Сию минуту,  сказал он, уходяще скрипнув, хоть уйти медля.  Прекрасный и неприспособленный мечтатель в болезненном столкновении с жестокой реальностью. Постоянно убеждаешься, насколько истинны суждения Гете. Истинны при более глубоком анализе.Двускрипно в куранте унес он анализ прочь. Плешивый, с высшим вниманьем, у двери словам помощника подставил большое ухо: слова выслушал: удалился.Остались двое. Мсье де ла Палисс[],  язвительно усмехнулся Стивен,  был еще жив за четверть часа до смерти. А вы уже отыскали шестерку доблестных медиков[],  вопросил желчным старцем Джон Эглинтон,  которые бы переписали Потерянный рай под вашу диктовку? Он его называет Горести Сатаны.Усмехайся. Усмехайся усмешкой Крэнли.Сперва ее облапилПотом ее огладилА после взял и вдругКатетер ей приладил.Ведь он был просто докторВеселый парень док[] Я думаю, для Гамлета вам понадобится на одного больше. Число семь драгоценно для мистиков. Сияющая седмица[], как выражается У.Б.Блескоглазый с рыжепорослым черепом подле зеленой настольной лампы вглядывался туда где в тени еще темнозеленей брадообрамленное лицо, оллав, святоокий[]. Рассмеялся тихо: смех казеннокоштного питомца Тринити: безответный.Многоголосый Сатана, рыдая[],Потоки слез лия, как ангелы их льют.      []Мои безумства у него в заложниках.Крэнли нужно одиннадцать молодцев из Уиклоу, чтобы освободить землю предков[]. Щербатую Кетлин[] с четырьмя изумрудными лугами: чужак у нее в доме. И одного бы еще, кто бы его приветствовал: аве, равви: дюжина из Тайнахили. Он воркует в тени долины, сзывая их[]. Юность моей души я отдавал ему, ночь за ночью. Бог в помощь. Доброй охоты.Моя телеграмма у Маллигана.Безумство. Поупорствуем в нем. Нашим молодым ирландским бардам,  суровым цензором продолжал Джон Эглинтон,  еще предстоит создать такой образ, который мир поставил бы рядом с Гамлетом англосакса Шекспира, хоть я, как прежде старина Бен[], восхищаюсь им, не доходя до идолопоклонства. Все это чисто академические вопросы,  провещал Рассел из своего темного угла,  о том, кто такой Гамлет  сам Шекспир или Яков Первый или же Эссекс[]. Споры церковников об историчности Иисуса. Искусство призвано раскрывать нам идеи, духовные сущности, лишенные формы[]. Краеугольный вопрос о произведении искусства  какова глубина жизни, породившей его. Живопись Гюстава Моро  это живопись идей[]. Речи Гамлета, глубочайшие стихи Шелли дают нашему сознанию приобщиться вечной премудрости, платоновскому миру идей. А все прочее  праздномыслие учеников для учеников. А.Э. рассказывал в одном интервью, которое он дал какому-то янки. Н-ну, тыща чертей, вы молодчага, проф! Ученые были сначала учениками,  сказал Стивен с высшею вежливостью. Аристотель был в свое время учеником Платона. Смею надеяться, он и остался им,  процедил лениво Джон Эглинтон.  Так и видишь его примерным учеником с похвальной грамотой под мышкой.Он снова рассмеялся, обращаясь к брадообрамленному ответно улыбнувшемуся лицу.Лишенное формы духовное. Отец, Слово и Святое Дыхание. Всеотец, небесный человек, Иэсос Кристос, чародей прекрасного. Логос, что в каждый миг страдает за нас. Это поистине есть то. Я огнь над алтарем. Я жертвенный жир.Данлоп, Джадж, что римлянин был самый благородный, А.Э., Арвал, Несказанное Имя, в высоте небес, К.Х., их учитель, личность которого не является тайной для посвященных. Братья великой белой ложи неусыпно следят, не требуется ли их помощь. Христос с сестрою-невестой, влага света, рожденная от девы с обновленной душой, софия кающаяся, удалившаяся в план Будд. Эзотерическая жизнь не для обыкновенного человека. О.Ч. сначала должен избавиться от своей дурной кармы. Однажды миссис Купер Оукли на мгновение улицезрела астральное нашей выдающейся сестры Е.П.Б.[]Фу, как нехорошо! []! Право, негоже, сударыня, совсем негоже глазеть, когда у дамы выглядывает астральное.Вошел мистер Супер  младой, высокий, легкий и деликатный. Рука его с изяществом держала блокнот  большой, красивый, чистый и аккуратный. Вот этот примерный ученик,  сказал Стивен,  наверняка считает, что размышления Гамлета о будущей жизни его сиятельной души  весь этот ненатуральный, ненужный, недраматичный монолог  такие же плоские, как и у Платона.Джон Эглинтон сказал, нахмурившись, дыша ярым гневом: Я клянусь, что кровь моя закипает в жилах, когда я слышу, как сравнивают Аристотеля с Платоном. А кто из них,  спросил Стивен,  изгнал бы меня из своего Государства[]?Кинжалы дефиниций  из ножен! Лошадность  это чтойность вселошади. Они поклоняются зонам и волнам влечений. Бог  шум на улице: весьма в духе перипатетиков. Пространство  то, что у тебя хочешь не хочешь перед глазами. Через пространства, меньшие красных шариков человечьей крови, пролезали они следом за ягодицами Блейка в вечность, коей растительный мир сей  лишь тень. Держись за здесь и теперь, сквозь которые будущее погружается в прошлое[][].Мистер Супер, полный дружеского расположения, подошел к своему коллеге. А Хейнс ушел,  сообщил он. Вот как? Я ему показывал эту книгу Жюбенвиля[]. Он, понимаете, в полном восторге от Любовных песен Коннахта Хайда. Мне не удалось привести его сюда послушать дискуссию. Он тут же побежал к Гиллу покупать их.Спеши скорей, мой скромный труд,К надменной публике на суд[].Как горький рок, тебя постиг Английский немощный язык. Дым наших торфяников ему одурманил голову,  предположил Джон Эглинтон.Мы, англичане, сознаем. Кающийся вор. Ушел. А я курил его табачок.Мерцающий зеленый камень. Смарагд, заключенный в оправу морей[]. Люди не знают, как могут быть опасны любовные песни,  оккультически предостерегла Расселова яйцевидная аура.  Движения, вызывающие мировые перевороты, рождаются из грез и видений в душе какого-нибудь крестьянина на склоне холма[]. Для них земля не почва для обработки, а живая мать.Разреженный воздух академии и арены рождает грошовый роман, кафешантанную песенку. Франция рождает в лице Малларме изысканнейший цветок развращенности, но вожделенная жизнь  такая, какой живут феаки Гомера, открывается только нищим духом[].При этих словах мистер Супер обратил к Стивену свой миролюбивый взор. Понимаете,  сказал он,  у Малларме есть чудные стихотворения в прозе, Стивен Маккенна мне их читал в Париже[]. Одно из них  о Гамлете[].Он говорит:   ,     -[], понимаете, читая книгу о самом себе. Он описывает, как дают Гамлета во французском городке, понимаете, в провинции. Там выпустили такую афишу.Его свободная рука изящно чертила в воздухе маленькие значки.     []Он повторил новонасупленному челу Джона Эглинтона:   , понимаете. Это так похоже на французов, совершенно в их духе.   Беззаботный нищий[],  закончил Стивен.Джон Эглинтон рассмеялся. Да, это подойдет, пожалуй,  согласился он.  Превосходные люди, нет сомнения, но в некоторых вещах ужасающе близоруки.Торжественно-тупое нагроможденье убийств. Роберт Грин назвал его палачом души[],  молвил Стивен.  Недаром он был сын мясника[], который помахивал своим топором да поплевывал в ладонь.Девять жизней заплачено за одну  за жизнь его отца[]. Отче наш иже еси во чистилище. Гамлеты в хаки стреляют без колебаний[]. Кровавая бойня пятого акта  предвидение концлагеря, воспетого Суинберном[].Крэнли, я его бессловесный ординарец, следящий за битвами издалека.Врагов заклятых матери и дети,Которых кроме нас никто б не пощадилУлыбка сакса или ржанье янки. Сцилла и Харибда. Он будет доказывать, что Гамлет  это история о призраках,  заметил Джон Эглинтон к сведению мистера Супера.  Он, как жирный парень в Пиквикском клубе, хочет, чтоб наша плоть застыла от ужаса[].О, слушай, слушай, слушай![]Моя плоть внимает ему: застыв, внимает.Если только ты А что такое призрак?  спросил Стивен с энергией и волненьем.  Некто, ставший неощутимым вследствие смерти или отсутствия или смены нравов. Елизаветинский Лондон столь же далек от Стратфорда, как развращенный Париж от целомудренного Дублина. Кто же тот призрак, из  [] возвращающийся в мир, где его забыли? Кто король Гамлет?Джон Эглинтон задвигался щуплым туловищем, откинулся назад, оценивая. Клюнуло. Середина июня, это же время дня,  начал Стивен, быстрым взглядом прося внимания.  На крыше театра у реки поднят флаг. Невдалеке, в Парижском саду, ревет в своей яме медведь Саккерсон. Старые моряки, что плавали еще с Дрэйком, жуют колбаски среди публики на стоячих местах[].Местный колорит. Вали все что знаешь. Вызови эффект присутствия. Шекспир вышел из дома гугенотов на Силвер-стрит. Вот он проходит по берегу мимо лебединых садков. Но он не задерживается, чтобы покормить лебедку, подгоняющую к тростникам свой выводок. У лебедя Эйвона иные думы[].Воображение места. Святой Игнатий Лойола, спеши на помощь![] Представление начинается. В полумраке возникает актер, одетый в старую кольчугу с плеча придворного щеголя, мужчина крепкого сложения, с низким голосом. Это  призрак, это король, король и не король[], а актер  это Шекспир, который все годы своей жизни, не отданные суете сует, изучал Гамлета, чтобы сыграть роль призрака. Он обращается со словами роли к Бербеджу[], молодому актеру, который стоит перед ним по ту сторону смертной завесы, и называет его по имени:Гамлет, я дух родного твоего отца,и требует себя выслушать. Он обращается к сыну, сыну души своей, юному принцу Гамлету, и к своему сыну по плоти, Гамнету Шекспиру, который умер в Стратфорде, чтобы взявший имя его мог бы жить вечно. И неужели возможно, чтобы актер Шекспир, призрак в силу отсутствия, а в одеянии похороненного монарха Дании[] призрак и в силу смерти, говоря свои собственные слова носителю имени собственного сына (будь жив Гамнет Шекспир, он был бы близнецом принца Гамлета),  неужели это возможно, я спрашиваю, неужели вероятно, чтобы он не сделал или не предвидел бы логических выводов из этих посылок: ты обездоленный сын  я убитый отец  твоя мать преступная королева, Энн Шекспир, урожденная Хэтуэй? Но это копанье в частной жизни великого человека,  нетерпеливо вмешался Рассел.Ага, старик, и ты?[] Интересно лишь для приходского писаря. У нас есть пьесы. И когда перед нами поэзия Короля Лира  что нам до того, как жил поэт? Обыденная жизнь  ее наши слуги могли бы прожить за нас, как заметил Вилье де Лиль[].Вынюхивать закулисные сплетни: поэт пил, поэт был в долгах. У нас есть Король Лир  и он бессмертен.Лицо мистера Супера  адресат слов  выразило согласие.Стреми над ними струи вод, тебе подвластных,Мананаан, Мананаан, Мак-Лир[]А как, любезный, насчет того фунта, что он одолжил тебе, когда ты голодал?О, еще бы, я так нуждался.Прими сей золотой.Брось заливать! Ты его почти весь оставил в постели Джорджины Джонсон, дочки священника. Жагала сраму.А ты намерен его отдать?О, без сомнения.Когда же? Сейчас?Ну нет пока.Так когда же?Я никому не должен. Я никому не должен.Спокойствие. Он с того берега Война[]. С северо-востока. Долг за тобой.Нет, погоди. Пять месяцев. Молекулы все меняются. Я уже Другой я. Не тот, что занимал фунт.Неужто? Ах-ах-ах![]Но я, энтелехия[], форма форм, сохраняю я благодаря памяти, ибо формы меняются непрестанно.Я, тот что грешил и молился и постился.Ребенок, которого Конми спас от порки.Я, я и я. Я.А.Э. Я ваш должник. Вы собираетесь бросить вызов трехсотлетней традиции?  язвительно вопросил Джон Эглинтон.  Вот уж ее призрак никогда никого не тревожил. Она скончалась  для литературы, во всяком случае,  прежде своего рождения. Она скончалась,  парировал Стивен,  через шестьдесят семь лет после своего рождения. Она видела его входящим в жизнь и покидающим ее. Она была его первой возлюбленной. Она родила ему детей. И она закрыла ему глаза, положив медяки на веки, когда он покоился на смертном одре.Мать на смертном одре. Свеча. Занавешенное зеркало. Та, что дала мне жизнь, лежит здесь, с медяками на веках, убранная дешевыми цветами.  .Я плакал один.Джон Эглинтон глядел на свернувшегося светлячка в своей лампе. Принято считать, что Шекспир совершил ошибку,  произнес он,  но потом поскорее ее исправил, насколько мог. Вздор!  резко заявил Стивен.  Гений не совершает ошибок. Его блуждания намеренны, они  врата открытия.Врата открытия распахнулись, чтобы впустить квакера-библиотекаря, скрипоногого, плешивого, ушастого, деловитого. Строптивицу,  возразил строптиво Джон Эглинтон,  с большим трудом представляешь вратами открытия. Какое, интересно, открытие Сократ сделал благодаря Ксантиппе? Диалектику,  отвечал Стивен,  а благодаря своей матери  искусство рожденья мыслей[]. А чему научился он у своей другой жены, Мирто ( ![]), у Эпипсихидиона Сократидидиона[], того не узнает уж ни один мужчина, тем паче женщина. Однако ни мудрость повитухи, ни сварливые поучения не спасли его от архонтов[] из Шинн Фейн и от их стопочки цикуты. Но все-таки Энн Хэтуэй?  прозвучал негромкий примирительный голос мистера Супера.  Кажется, мы забываем о ней, как прежде сам Шекспир.С задумчивой бороды на язвительный череп переходил его взгляд, дабы напомнить, дабы укорить, без недоброты, переместившись затем к тыкве лысорозовой лолларда[], подозреваемого безвинно. У него было на добрую деньгу ума[],  сказал Стивен,  и память далеко не дырявая. Он нес свои воспоминания при себе, когда поспешал в град столичный, насвистывая Оставил я свою подружку[]. Не будь даже время указано землетрясением[], мы бы должны были знать, где это все было  бедный зайчонок, дрожащий в своей норке под лай собак, и уздечка пестрая, и два голубых окна. Эти воспоминания, Венера и Адонис, лежали в будуаре у каждой лондонской прелестницы. Разве и вправду строптивая Катарина неказиста? Гортензио называет ее юною и прекрасной[]. Или вы думаете, что автор Антония и Клеопатры, страстный пилигрим[], вдруг настолько ослеп, что выбрал разделять свое ложе самую мерзкую мегеру во всем Уорикшире?Признаем: он оставил ее, чтобы покорить мир мужчин. Но его героини, которых играли юноши, это героини юношей. Их жизнь, их мысли, их речи  плоды мужского воображения. Он неудачно выбрал? Как мне кажется, это его выбрали. Бывал наш Вилл и с другими мил, но только Энн взяла его в плен.Божусь, вина на ней[]. Она опутала его на славу, эта резвушка двадцати шести лет[]. Сероглазая богиня[], что склоняется над юношей Адонисом, нисходит, чтобы покорить[], словно пролог счастливый к возвышенью[], это и есть бесстыжая бабенка из Стратфорда, что валит в пшеницу своего любовника, который моложе нее.А мой черед? Когда?Приди! В рожь,  уточнил мистер Супер светло и радостно, поднимая новый блокнот свой радостно и светло.И с белокурым удовольствием для всеобщего сведения напомнил негромко:Во ржи густой слила устаПрелестных поселян чета[].Парис: угодник, которому угодили на славу.Рослая фигура в лохматой домотканине поднялась из тени и извлекла свои кооперативные часы. К сожалению, мне пора в Хомстед.Куда ж это он? Почва для обработки. Как, вы уходите?  вопросили подвижные брови Джона Эглинтона.  А вечером мы увидимся у Мура? Там появится Пайпер[]. Пайпер?  переспросил мистер Супер.  Пайпер уже вернулся?Питер Пайпер с перепою пересыпал персики каперсами. Не уверен, что я смогу. Четверг. У нас собрание[]. Если только получится уйти вовремя.Йогобогомуть в меблирашках Доусона. Изида без покрова. Их священную книгу на пали мы как-то пытались заложить. С понтом под зонтом, на поджатых ногах, восседает царственный ацтекский Логос, орудующий на разных астральных уровнях, их сверхдуша, махамахатма. Братия верных, герметисты, созревшие для посвященья в ученики, водят хороводы вокруг него, ожидают, дабы пролился свет. Луис Х.Виктори, Т.Колфилд Ирвин. Девы Лотоса ловят их взгляды с обожаньем, шишковидные железы их так и пылают. Он же царствует, преисполненный своего бога. Будда под банановой сенью. Душ поглотитель и кружитель. Души мужчин, души женщин, душно от душ. С жалобным воплем кружимые, уносимые вихрем, они стенают, кружась.В глухую квинтэссенциальную ничтожность,В темницу плоти ввергнута душа. Говорят, что нас ожидает литературный сюрприз,  тоном дружеским и серьезным промолвил квакер-библиотекарь.  Разнесся слух, будто бы мистер Рассел подготовил сборник стихов наших молодых поэтов[]. Мы ждем с большим интересом.С большим интересом он глянул в сноп ламповых лучей, где три лица высветились, блестя.Смотри и запоминай.Стивен глянул вниз на безглавую шляпенцию, болтающуюся на ручке тросточки у его колен. Мой шлем и меч. Слегка дотронуться указательными пальцами. Опыт Аристотеля[]. Одна или две? Необходимость есть то, в силу чего вещам становится невозможно быть по-другому.

Мне понравился Погонщик Колема. Да, у него, пожалуй, имеется эта диковина, гениальность. Так вы считаете, в нем есть искра гениальности? Йейтс восхищался его двустишием: Так в черной глубине земли Порой блеснет античный мрамор. В самом деле? Я надеюсь, вы все же появитесь сегодня.Мэйлахи Маллиган тоже придет. Мур попросил его привести Хейнса. Вы уже слышали остроту мисс Митчелл насчет Мура и Мартина? О том, что Мур  это грехи молодости Мартина? Отлично найдено, не правда ли? Они вдвоем напоминают Дон Кихота и Санчо Пансу. Как любит повторять доктор Сигерсон, наш национальный эпос еще не создан. Мур  тот человек, который способен на это. Наш дублинский рыцарь печального образа. В шафранной юбке? ОНил Рассел? Ну как же, он должен говорить на великом древнем наречии. А его Дульсинея? Джеймс Стивенс пишет весьма неглупые очерки. Пожалуй, мы приобретаем известный вес[].Корделия. []. Самая одинокая из дочерей Лира[].Глухомань. А теперь покажи свой парижский лоск. Покорнейше благодарю, мистер Рассел,  сказал Стивен, вставая.  Если вы будете столь любезны передать то письмо мистеру Норману[] О, разумеется. Он его поместит, если сочтет важным. Знаете, у нас столько корреспонденции. Я понимаю,  отвечал Стивен.  Благодарю вас.Дай тебе Бог. Свиная газетка. Отменно быколюбива. Синг тоже обещал мне статью для Даны. Но будут ли нас читать?Сдается мне, что будут. Гэльская лига хочет что-нибудь на ирландском[].Надеюсь, что вы придете вечером. И прихватите Старки.Стивен снова уселся.Отделясь от прощающихся, подошел квакер-библиотекарь. Краснея, его личина произнесла: Мистер Дедал, ваши суждения поразительно проясняют все.С прискрипом переступая туда-сюда, сближался он на цыпочках с небом на высоту каблука[], и, уходящими заглушаем, спросил тихонько: Значит, по вашему мнению, она была неверна поэту?Встревоженное лицо предо мной. Почему он подошел? Из вежливости или по внутреннему озарению[]? Где было примирение,  молвил Стивен,  там прежде должен был быть разрыв. Это верно.Лис Христов[] в грубых кожаных штанах, беглец, от облавы скрывавшийся в трухлявых дуплах. Не имеет подруги, в одиночку уходит от погони. Женщин, нежный пол, склонял он на свою сторону, блудниц вавилонских, судейских барынь, жен грубиянов-кабатчиков. Игра в гусей и лисицу. А в Нью-Плейс  обрюзглое опозоренное существо, некогда столь миловидное, столь нежное, свежее как юное деревце, а ныне листья его опали все до единого, и страшится мрака могилы, и нет прощения. Это верно. Значит, вы полагаетеЗакрылась дверь за ушедшим.Покой воцарился вдруг в укромной сводчатой келье, покой и тепло, располагающие к задумчивости.Светильник весталки.Тут он раздумывает о несбывшемся: о том, как бы жил Цезарь, если бы поверил прорицателю  о том, что бы могло быть  о возможностях возможного как такового  о неведомых вещах  о том, какое имя носил Ахилл, когда он жил среди женщин[].Вокруг меня мысли, заключенные в гробах, в саркофагах, набальзамированные словесными благовониями. Бог Тот, покровитель библиотек, увенчанный луной птицебог. И услышал я глас египетского первосвященника. Книг груды глиняных в чертогах расписных .Они недвижны. А некогда кипели в умах людей. Недвижны: но все еще пожирает их смертный зуд: хныча, нашептывать мне на ухо свои басни, навязывать мне свою волю. Бесспорно,  философствовал Джон Эглинтон,  из всех великих людей он самый загадочный. Мы ничего не знаем о нем, знаем лишь, что он жил и страдал. Верней, даже этого не знаем. Другие нам ответят на вопрос[]. А все остальное покрыто мраком. Но ведь Гамлет  там столько личного, разве вы не находите?  выступил мистер Супер.  Я хочу сказать, это же почти как дневник, понимаете, дневник его личной жизни. Я хочу сказать, меня вовсе не волнует, кто там, понимаете, преступник или кого убилиОн положил девственно чистый блокнот на край стола, улыбкою заключив свой выпад. Его личный дневник в подлиннике.      .   []. А ты это посыпь английской солью, малютка Джон[].И глаголет малютка Джон Эглинтон: После того, что нам рассказывал Мэйлахи Маллиган, я мог ожидать парадоксов. Но должен предупредить: если вы хотите разрушить мое убеждение, что Шекспир это Гамлет, перед вами тяжелая задача.Прошу немного терпения.Стивен выдержал тяжелый взгляд скептика, ядовито посверкивающий из-под насупленных бровей. Василиск.     []. Мессир Брунетто[], благодарю тебя за подходящее слово. Подобно тому, как мы  или то матерь Дана[]?  сказал Стивен,  без конца ткем и распускаем телесную нашу ткань, молекулы которой день и ночь снуют взад-вперед,  так и художник без конца ткет и распускает ткань собственного образа. И подобно тому, как родинка у меня на груди по сей день там же, справа, где и была при рождении, хотя все тело уж много раз пересоткано из новой ткани,  так в призраке неупокоившегося отца вновь оживает образ почившего сына. В минуты высшего воодушевления, когда, по словам Шелли, наш дух словно пламенеющий уголь[], сливаются воедино тот, кем я был, и тот, кто я есмь, и тот, кем, возможно, мне предстоит быть. Итак, в будущем, которое сестра прошлого, я, может быть, снова увижу себя сидящим здесь, как сейчас, но только глазами того, кем я буду тогда.Сие покушение на высокий стиль  не без помощи Драммонда из Хоторндена[]. Да-да,  раздался юный голос мистера Супера.  Мне Гамлет кажется совсем юным. Возможно, что горечь в нем  от отца, но уж сцены с Офелией  несомненно, от сына.Пальцем в небо. Он в моем отце. Я в его сыне. Вот родинка, которая исчезнет последней,  отозвался Стивен со смехом.Джон Эглинтон сделал пренедовольную мину. Будь это знаком гения,  сказал он,  гении шли бы по дешевке в базарный день. Поздние пьесы Шекспира, которыми так восхищался Ренан[], проникнуты иным духом. Духом примирения,  шепнул проникновенно квакер-библиотекарь. Не может быть примирения,  сказал Стивен,  если прежде него не было разрыва.Уже говорил. Если вы хотите узнать, тени каких событий легли на жуткие времена Короля Лира, Отелло, Гамлета, Троила и Крессиды,  попробуйте разглядеть, когда же и как тени эти рассеиваются. Чем сердце смягчит человек, Истерзанный в бурях мира, Бывалый как сам Одиссей. Перикл, что был князем Тира[]?Глава под красношапкой остроконечной, заушанная, слезоточивая. Младенец, девочка, у него на руках, Марина. Тяга софистов к окольным тропам апокрифов  величина постоянная,  сделал открытие Джон Эглинтон.  Столбовые дороги скучны, однако они-то и ведут в город.Старина Бэкон: уж весь заплесневел. Шекспир  грехи молодости Бэкона[].Жонглеры цифрами и шифрами шагают по столбовым дорогам[]. Пытливые умы в великом поиске. Какой же город, почтенные мудрецы? Обряжены в имена: А.Э.  эон; Маги  Джон Эглинтон. Восточнее солнца, западнее луны[]:   -[]. Парочка, оба в сапогах, с посохами.Сколько миль до Дублина?Трижды пять и пять.Долго ли при свечке нам до него скакать?[] По мнению господина Брандеса,  заметил Стивен,  это первая из пьес заключительного периода. В самом деле? А что говорит мистер Сидней Ли, он же Симон Лазарь, как некоторые уверяют? Марина,  продолжал Стивен,  дитя бури. Миранда  чудо, Пердита  потерянная[]. Что было потеряно, вернулось к нему: дитя его дочери. Перикл говорит: Моя милая жена была похожа на эту девочку. Спрашивается, как человек полюбит дочь, если он не любил ее мать? Искусство быть дедушкой[],  забормотал мистер Супер.    [] Для человека, у которого имеется эта диковина, гениальность, лишь его собственный образ служит мерилом всякого опыта, духовного и практического.Сходство такого рода тронет его. Но образы других мужей, ему родственных по крови, его оттолкнут. Он в них увидит только нелепые потуги природы предвосхитить или скопировать его самого[].Благосклонное чело квакера-библиотекаря осветилось розовою надеждой. Я надеюсь, мистер Дедал разовьет и дальше свою теорию на благо просвещения публики. И мы непременно должны упомянуть еще одного комментатора-ирландца  Джорджа Бернарда Шоу. Нельзя здесь не вспомнить и Фрэнка Харриса: у него блестящие статьи о Шекспире в Сатердей ривью.Любопытно, что и он также настаивает на этом неудачном романе со смуглой леди сонетов[]. Счастливый соперник  Вильям Херберт, граф Пембрук. Но я убежден, что если даже поэт и оказался отвергнутым, это более гармонировало  как бы тут выразиться?  с нашими представлениями о том, чего не должно быть.Довольный, он смолк, вытянув кротко к ним плешивую голову  гагачье яйцо, приз для победителя в споре.Супружеская речь звучала бы у него суровым библейским слогом. Любишь ли мужа сего, Мириам? Данного тебе от Господа Твоего? И это не исключено,  отозвался Стивен.  У Гете есть одно изречение, которое мистер Маги любит цитировать. Остерегайся того, к чему ты стремишься в юности, ибо ты получишь это сполна в зрелые лета[]. Почему он посылает к известной [], к той бухте, где все мужи бросали якорь[], к фрейлине со скандальною славой еще в девичестве, какого-то мелкого лордишку, чтобы тот поухаживал вместо него? Ведь он уже сам был лордом в словесности[], и успел стать отменным кавалером, и написал Ромео и Джульетту". Так почему же тогда? Вера в себя была подорвана прежде времени. Он начал с того, что был повержен на пшеничном поле (виноват, на ржаном),  и после этого он уже никогда не сможет чувствовать себя победителем и не узнает победы в бойкой игре, в которой веселье и смех  путь к постели. Напускное донжуанство его не спасет. Его отделали так, что не переделать. Кабаний клык его поразил туда, где кровью истекает любовь[][]. Пусть даже строптивая и укрощена, ей всегда еще остается невидимое оружие женщины. Я чувствую за его словами, как плоть словно стрекалом толкает его к новой страсти, еще темней первой, затемняющей даже его понятия о самом себе. Похожая судьба и ожидает его  и оба безумия совьются в единый вихрь.Они внимают. И я в ушные полости им лью. Его душа еще прежде была смертельно поражена, яд влит в ушную полость заснувшего. Но те, кого убили во сне, не могут знать, каким же способом они умерщвлены, если только Творец не наделит этим знанием их души в будущей жизни. Ни об отравлении, ни о звере с двумя спинами, что был причиной его, не мог бы знать призрак короля Гамлета, не будь он наделен этим знанием от Творца своего. Вот почему его речь (его английский немощный язык) все время уходит куда-то в сторону, куда-то назад.Насильник и жертва, то, чего он хотел бы, но не хотел бы[], следуют неотлучно за ним, от полушарий Лукреции[] цвета слоновой кости с синими жилками к обнаженной груди Имогены[], где родинка как пять пурпурных точек.Он возвращается обратно, уставший от всех творений, которые он нагромоздил, чтобы спрятаться от себя самого, старый пес, зализывающий старую рану. Но его утраты  для него прибыль, личность его не оскудевает, и он движется к вечности, не почерпнув ничего из той мудрости, которую сам создал, и тех законов, которые сам открыл. Его забрало поднято[]. Он призрак, он тень сейчас, ветер в утесах Эльсинора, или что угодно, зов моря, слышный лишь в сердце того, кто сущность его тени, сын, единосущный отцу. Аминь!  раздался ответный возглас от дверей.Нашел ты меня, враг мой![]Антракт .Охальная физиономия с постной миной соборного настоятеля: Бык Маллиган в пестром шутовском наряде продвигался вперед, навстречу приветственным улыбкам. Моя телеграмма. Если не ошибаюсь, ты тут разглагольствуешь о газообразном позвоночном?  осведомился он у Стивена.Лимонножилетный, он бодро слал всем приветствия, размахивая панамой словно шутовским жезлом.Они оказывают ему теплый прием.   ,    [].Орава зубоскалов: Фотий, псевдомалахия, Иоганн Мост[].Тот, Кто зачал Сам Себя при посредничестве Святого Духа и Сам послал Себя Искупителем между Собой и другими. Кто взят был врагами Своими на поругание, и обнаженным бичеван, и пригвожден аки нетопырь к амбарной двери и умер от голода на кресте, Кто дал предать Его погребению, и восстал из гроба, и отомкнул ад, и вознесся на небеса где и восседает вот уже девятнадцать веков одесную Самого Себя но еще воротится в последний день судити живых и мертвых когда все живые будут уже мертвы[].    [].Он воздевает руки. Завесы падают. О, цветы! Колокола, колокола, сплошной гул колоколов. Да, именно так,  отвечал квакер-библиотекарь.  Очень Ценная и поучительная беседа. Я уверен, что у мистера Маллигана тоже имеется своя теория по поводу пьесы и по поводу Шекспира. Надо учитывать все стороны жизни.Он улыбнулся, обращая свою улыбку поровну во все стороны.Бык Маллиган с интересом задумался. Шекспир?  переспросил он.  Мне кажется, я где-то слыхал это имя.Быстрая улыбка солнечным лучиком скользнула по его рыхлым чертам. Ну, да!  радостно произнес он, припомнив.  Это ж тот малый, что валяет под Синга[].Мистер Супер обернулся к нему. Вас искал Хейнс,  сказал он.  Вы не видали его? Он собирался потом с вами встретиться в ДХК. А сейчас он направился к Гиллу покупать Любовные песни Коннахта Хайда. Я шел через музей,  ответил Бык Маллиган.  А он тут был? Соотечественникам великого барда,  заметил Джон Эглинтон,  наверняка уже надоели наши замечательные теории. Как я слышал, некая актриса в Дублине вчера играла Гамлета в четыреста восьмой раз. Вайнинг утверждал, будто бы принц был женщиной. Интересно, еще никто не догадался сделать из него ирландца? Мне помнится, судья Бартон[] занимается разысканиями на эту тему. Он  я имею в виду его высочество, а не его светлость  клянется святым Патриком. Но замечательнее всего  этот рассказ Уайльда,  сказал мистер Супер, поднимая свой замечательный блокнот.  Портрет В.Х., где он доказывает, что сонеты были написаны неким Вилли Хьюзом, мужем, в чьей власти все цвета. Вы хотите сказать, посвящены Вилли Хьюзу?  переспросил квакер-библиотекарь.Или Хилли Вьюзу? Или самому себе, Вильяму Художнику. В.Х.: угадай, кто я[]? Да-да, конечно, посвящены,  признал мистер Супер, охотно внося поправку в свою ученую глоссу.  Понимаете, тут, конечно, сплошные парадоксы, Хьюз и , то есть, он режет, и , цвета, но это для него настолько типично, как он это все увязывает. Тут, понимаете, самая суть Уайльда. Воздушная легкость.Его улыбчивый взгляд с воздушною легкостью скользнул по их лицам.Белокурый эфеб. Выхолощенная суть Уайльда[].До чего же ты остроумен. Пропустив пару стопочек на дукаты магистра Дизи.Сколько же я истратил? Пустяк, несколько шиллингов.На ватагу газетчиков. Юмор трезвый и пьяный[].Остроумие. Ты отдал бы все пять видов ума, не исключая его, за горделивый юности наряд[], в котором он, красуясь, выступает. Приметы утоленного желанья[].Их будет еще мно. Возьми ее для меня. В брачную пору. Юпитер, охлади их любовную горячку[]. Ага, поворкуй с ней.Ева. Нагой пшеничнолонный грех. Змей обвивает ее своими кольцами, целует, его поцелуй  укус. Вы думаете, это всего только парадокс?  вопрошал квакер-библиотекарь.  Бывает, что насмешника не принимают всерьез, как раз когда он вполне серьезен.Они с полной серьезностью обсуждали серьезность насмешника.Бык Маллиган с застывшим выражением лица вдруг тяжко уставился на Стивена. Потом, мотая головой, подошел вплотную, вытащил из кармана сложенную телеграмму. Проворные губы принялись читать, вновь озаряясь восторженною улыбкой. Телеграмма!  воскликнул он.  Дивное вдохновение! Телеграмма!Папская булла!Он уселся на краешек одного из столов без лампы и громко, весело прочитал: Сентиментальным нужно назвать того, кто способен наслаждаться, не обременяя себя долгом ответственности за содеянное []. Подпись: Дедал.Откуда ж ты это отбил? Из бардака? Да нет. Колледж Грин. Четыре золотых уже пропил? Тетушка грозится поговорить с твоим убогосущным отцом.Телеграмма! Мэйлахи Маллигану, Корабль, Нижняя Эбби-стрит. О, бесподобный комедиант! В попы подавшийся клинкианец!Он бодро сунул телеграмму вместе с конвертом в карман и зачастил вдруг простонародным говорком: Вот я те и толкую[], мил человек, сидим это мы там, я да Хейнс, преем да нюним, а тут те вдобавок эту несут. И этакая нас разбирает тоска по адскому пойлу, что, вот те крест, тут и монаха бы проняло, самого даже хилого на эти дела. А мы как бараны торчим у Коннери  час торчим, потом два часа, потом три, да все ждем, когда ж нам достанется хотя бы по пинте на душу.Он причитал: И вот торчим мы там, мой сердешный, а ты в ус не дуешь да еще рассылаешь такие бумаженции что у нас языки отвисли наружу на целый локоть как у святых отцов с пересохшей глоткой кому без рюмашки хуже кондрашки.Стивен расхохотался.Бык Маллиган быстро наклонился к нему с предостерегающим жестом. Этот бродяга Синг тебя всюду ищет, чтобы убить,  сообщил он.  Ему рассказали, что это ты обоссал его дверь в Гластуле. И вот он рыскает везде в поршнях, хочет тебя убить. Меня!  возопил Стивен.  Это был твой вклад в литературу.Бык Маллиган откинулся назад, донельзя довольный, и смех его вознесся к темному, чутко внимавшему потолку. Ей-ей, прикончит!  заливался он.Грубое лицо[], напоминающее старинных чудищ, на меня ополчалось, когда сиживали за месивом из требухи на улице Сент-Андре-дезар. Слова из слов ради слов, []. Ойсин с Патриком. Как он повстречал фавна в Кламарском лесу, размахивающего бутылкой вина.   ![] Мордует ирландский язык.Блуждая, повстречал он образ свой. А я  свой. Сейчас в лесу шута я встретил[]. Мистер Листер,  позвал помощник, приоткрыв дверь. где всякий может отыскать то, что ему по вкусу. Так судья Мэдден[] в своих Записках магистра Вильяма Сайленса отыскал у него охотничью терминологию Да-да, в чем дело? Там пришел один джентльмен, сэр,  сказал помощник, подходя ближе и протягивая визитную карточку.  Он из Фримена и хотел бы просмотреть подшивку Килкенни пипл за прошлый год. Пожалуйста-пожалуйста-пожалуйста. А что, этот джентльмен?Он взял деловитую карточку, глянул, не рассмотрел, отложил, не взглянув, посмотрел снова, спросил, скрипнул, спросил: А он? А, вон там!Стремительно в гальярде он двинулся прочь, наружу. В коридоре, при свете дня, заговорил он велеречиво, исполнен усердия и доброжелательства, с сознанием долга, услужливейший, добрейший, честнейший из всех сущих квакеров. Вот этот джентльмен? Фрименс джорнэл? Килкенни пипл?Всенепременно. Добрый день, сэр. Килкенни Ну, конечно, имеетсяТерпеливый силуэт слушал и ждал. Все ведущие провинциальные Нозерн виг, Корк икземинер, Эннискорти гардиан. За тысяча девятьсот третий. Желаете посмотреть?Ивенс, проводите джентльмена Пожалуйте за этим служи Или позвольте, я сам Сюда Пожалуйте, сэрУслужливый и велеречивый, возглавлял шествие он ко всем провинциальным газетам, и темный пригнувшийся силуэт поспешал за его скорым шагом.Дверь затворилась. Это тот пархатый!  воскликнул Бык Маллиган.Резво вскочив, он подобрал карточку. Как там его? Ицка Мойше[]? Блум.И тут же затараторил: Иегова, сборщик крайней плоти, больше не существует. Я этого встретил в музее, когда зашел туда поклониться пеннорожденной Афродите. Греческие уста, что никогда не изогнулись в молитве. Мы каждый день должны ей воздавать честь. О, жизни жизнь, твои уста воспламеняют[].Неожиданно он обернулся к Стивену. Он знает тебя. И знает твоего старикана. Ого, я опасаюсь, что он погречистей самих греков[]. Глаза его, бледного галилеянина, были так и прикованы к ее нижней ложбинке. Венера Каллипига. О, гром сих чресл! фавн преследует дев, те же укрыться спешат. Мы бы хотели послушать дальше,  решил Джон Эглинтон с одобрения мистера Супера.  Нас заинтересовала миссис Ш. Раньше мы о ней думали (если когда-нибудь приходилось) как об этакой верной Гризельде, о Пенелопе у очага[]. Антисфен, ученик Горгия,  начал Стивен,  отнял пальму первенства в красоте у племенной матки Кюриоса Менелая, аргивянки Елены, у этой троянской кобылы, в которой квартировал целый полк героев,  и передал ее скромной Пенелопе. Он прожил в Лондоне двадцать лет, и были времена, когда он получал жалованья не меньше чем лорд-канцлер Ирландии. Жил он богато.Его искусство, которое Уитмен назвал искусством феодализма[], скорее уж было искусством пресыщения. Паштеты, зеленые кубки с хересом, соусы на меду, варенье из розовых лепестков, марципаны, голуби, начиненные крыжовником, засахаренные коренья. Когда явились арестовать сэра Уолтера Рэли[], на нем был наряд в полмиллиона франков и, в том числе, корсет по последней моде.Ростовщица Элиза Тюдор[] роскошью своего белья могла бы поспорить с царицей Савской. Двадцать лет он порхал между супружеским ложем с его чистыми радостями и блудодейною любовью с ее порочными наслаждениями. Вы знаете эту историю Маннингема[] про то, как одна мещаночка, увидев Дика Бербеджа в Ричарде Третьем, позвала его погреться к себе в постель, а Шекспир подслушал и, не делая много шума из ничего, прямиком взял корову за рога.Тут Бербедж является, устраивает стук у врат[], а Шекспир и отвечает ему из-под одеял мужа-рогоносца: Вильгельм Завоеватель царствует прежде Ричарда Третьего . И милая резвушка миссис Фиттон оседлай и воскликни: О![] и его нежная птичка, леди Пенелопа Рич[], и холеная светская дама годится актеру, и девки с набережной, пенни за раз.Кур ля-Рен.   .     . ?  ?[]-Сливки высшего света. И мамаша сэра Вильяма Дэвенанта из Оксфорда[], у которой для каждого самца чарка винца.Бык Маллиган, подняв глаза к небу, молитвенно возгласил: О, блаженная Маргарита Мария Ксамцускок![] И дочь Генриха-шестиженца[] и прочие подруги из ближних поместий[], коих воспел благородный поэт Лаун-Теннисон. Но как вы думаете, что делала все эти двадцать лет бедная Пенелопа в Стратфорде за ромбиками оконных переплетов?Действуй, действуй[]. Содеянное. Вот он, седеющий шатен, прогуливается в розарии ботаника Джерарда на Феттер-лейн[]. Колокольчик, что голубей ее жилок[]. Фиалка нежнее ресниц Юноны[]. Прогуливается. Всего одна жизнь нам дана. Одно тело. Действуй. Но только действуй. Невдалеке  грязь, пахучий дух похоти, руки лапают белизну.Бык Маллиган с силою хлопнул по столу Джона Эглинтона. Так вы на кого думаете?  спросил он с нажимом. Допустим, он  брошенный любовник в сонетах. Брошенный один раз, потом другой. Однако придворная вертихвостка его бросила ради лорда, ради его бесценнаямоялюбовь[].Любовь, которая назвать себя не смеет. Вы хотите сказать,  вставил Джон бурбон Эглинтон,  что он, как истый англичанин, питал слабость к лордам[].У старых стен мелькают молнией юркие ящерицы. В Шарантоне я наблюдал за ними. Похоже, что так,  отвечал Стивен,  коль скоро он готов оказать и ему и всем другим и любому невспаханному одинокому лону[] ту святую услугу, какую конюх оказывает жеребцу. Быть может, он, совсем как Сократ, имел не только строптивую жену, но и мать-повитуху. Но та-то строптивая вертихвостка не нарушала супружеского обета. Две мысли терзают призрака: нарушенный обет и тупоголовый мужлан, ставший ее избранником, брат покойного супруга. У милой Энн, я уверен, была горячая кровь. Соблазнившая один раз соблазнит и в другой.Стивен резко повернулся на стуле. Бремя доказательства не на мне, на вас,  произнес он, нахмурив брови.  Если вы отрицаете, что в пятой сцене Гамлета он заклеймил ее бесчестьем,  тогда объясните мне, почему о ней нет ни единого упоминания за все тридцать четыре года, с того дня, когда она вышла за него, и до того, когда она его схоронила. Всем этим женщинам довелось проводить в могилу своих мужчин: Мэри  своего благоверного Джона, Энн  бедного дорогого Вилли, когда тот вернулся к ней умирать, в ярости, что ему первому, Джоан  четырех братьев, Джудит  мужа и всех сыновей, Сьюзен  тоже мужа, а дочка Сьюзен, Элизабет[], если выразиться словами дедушки, вышла за второго[], убравши первого на тот свет. О да, упоминание есть. В те годы, когда он вел широкую жизнь в королевском Лондоне, ей, чтобы заплатить долг, пришлось занять сорок шиллингов у пастуха своего отца[].Теперь объясните все это. А заодно объясните и ту лебединую песнь, в которой он представил ее потомкам.Он обозрел их молчание.На это Эглинтон:Так вы о завещанье[].Юристы, кажется, его уж разъяснили.Ей, как обычно, дали вдовью часть.Все по законам.В них он был знаток,Как говорят нам судьи.А Сатана в ответ ему,Насмешник:И потому ни слова нет о нейВ наброске первом, но зато там естьПодарки и для внучки, и для дочек,И для сестры, и для друзей старинныхИ в Стратфорде, и в Лондоне.И потому, когда он все ж включил(Сдается мне, отнюдь не добровольно)Кой что и ей, то он ей завещалСвою, притом не лучшую,Кровать[][].ЗавещалЕйкроватьВторосортВтороватьКровещал.Тпру! В те времена у прелестных поселян бывало негусто движимого имущества,  заметил Джон Эглинтон,  как, впрочем, и ныне, если верить нашим пьесам из сельской жизни. Он был богатым землевладельцем,  возразил Стивен.  Он имел собственный герб, земельные угодья в Стратфорде, дом в Ирландском подворье. Он был пайщиком в финансовых предприятиях, занимался податными делами, мог повлиять на проведение закона в парламенте. И почему он не оставил ей лучшую свою кровать, если он ей желал мирно прохрапеть остаток своих ночей? Были, наверное, две кровати, одна получше, а другая  так, второй сорт,  подал тонкую догадку мистер Второсорт Супер.      [],  суперсострил Бык Маллиган и повлек улыбание. У древних упоминаются знаменитые постели. Сейчас попробую вспомнить,  наморщил лоб Второсорт Эглинтон, улыбаясь постельно. У древних упоминается[],  перебил его Стивен,  что Стагирит, школьник-шалопай и лысый мудрец язычников, умирая в изгнании, отпустил на волю и одарил своих рабов, воздал почести предкам и завещал, чтобы его схоронили подле останков его покойной жены. Друзей же он просил позаботиться о своей давней любовнице (вспомним тут новую Герпиллис, Нелл Гвинн) и позволить ей жить на его вилле. А вы тоже считаете, что он умер так?  спросил мистер Супер слегка озабоченно.  Я имею в виду Он умер, упившись в стельку[],  закрыл вопрос Бык Маллиган.  Кварта эля  королевское блюдо[]. Нет, вот я лучше расскажу вам, что изрек Доуден[]! А что?  вопросил Суперэглинтон.Вильям Шекспир и Ко[], акционерное общество. Общедоступный Вильям. Об условиях справляться: Э.Доуден, Хайфилд-хаус Бесподобно!  вздохнул с восхищением Бык Маллиган.  Я у него спросил, что он думает насчет обвинения в педерастии, взводимого на поэта.А он воздел кверху руки и отвечает: Мы можем единственно лишь сказать, что в те времена жизнь била ключом[]. Бесподобно!Извращенец. Чувство прекрасного совлекает нас с путей праведных,  сказал грустнопрекрасный Супер угловатому Углинтону.А непреклонный Джон отвечал сурово: Смысл этих слов нам может разъяснить доктор[]. Невозможно, чтобы и волки были сыты, и овцы целы.Тако глаголеши? Неужели они будут оспаривать у нас, у меня пальму первенства в красоте? А также и чувство собственности,  заметил Стивен.  Шейлока он извлек из собственных необъятных карманов. Сын ростовщика и торговца солодом, он и сам был ростовщик и торговец зерном, попридержавший десять мер зерна во время голодных бунтов. Те самые личности разных исповеданий, о которых говорит Четтл[] Фальстаф и которые засвидетельствовали его безупречность в делах,  они все были, без сомнения, его должники. Он подал в суд на одного из своих собратьев-актеров за несколько мешков солода и взыскивал людского мяса фунт[] в проценты за всякую занятую деньгу[]. А как бы еще конюх и помощник суфлера  смотри у Обри[] так быстро разбогател? Что бы ни делалось, он со всего имел свой навар. В Шейлоке слышны отзвуки той травли евреев, что разыгралась после того, как Лопеса[], лекаря королевы, повесили и четвертовали, а его еврейское сердце, кстати, вырвали из груди, пока пархатый еще дышал; в Гамлете и Макбете  отзвуки восшествия на престол шотландского философуса[], любившего поджаривать ведьм. В Бесплодных усилиях любви он потешается над гибелью Великой Армады. Помпезные его хроники плывут на гребне восторгов в духе Мафекинга[]. Судят ли иезуитов из Уорикшира[] тут же привратник поносит теорию двусмысленности. Вернулся ли Отважный мореход с Бермудских островов[] пишется тут же пьеса, что восхитила Ренана, и в ней  Пэтси Калибан, наш американский кузен. Слащавые сонеты явились вслед за сонетами Сидни. А что до феи Элизабет, или же рыжей Бесс[], разгульной девы, вдохновившей Виндзорских проказниц, то уж пускай какой-нибудь герр из Неметчины всю жизнь раскапывает глубинные смыслы на дне корзины с грязным бельем.Что ж, у тебя совсем недурно выходит. Вот только еще подпусти чего-нибудь теолого-филологологического. , , , []. Докажите, что он был еврей,  решился предложить Джон Эглинтон.  Вот ваш декан[] утверждает, будто он был католик. [].  В Германии,  отвечал Стивен,  из него сделали образцового французского лакировщика итальянских скандальных басен. Несметноликий человек[],  сметливо припомнил мистер Супер.  Кольридж его назвал несметноликим..            [] Святой Фома,  начал Стивен   [],  пробурчал Монах Маллиган, опускаясь в кресло.И запричитал с жалобным подвываньем.  !  ![] Теперь не иначе пропали мы[]! Как пить дать пропали!Все внесли по улыбке. Святой Фома[],  сказал, улыбаясь, Стивен,  чьи толстопузые тома мне столь приятно почитывать в оригинале, трактует о кровосмесительстве с иной точки зрения нежели та новая венская школа, о которой говорил мистер Маги.В своей мудрой и своеобычной манере он сближает его со скупостью чувств.Имеется в виду, что, отдавая любовь близкому по крови, тем самым как бы скупятся наделить ею того, кто дальше, но кто, быть может, жаждет ее.Евреи, которым христиане приписывают скупость[], больше всех наций привержены к единокровным бракам. Но обвинения эти  по злобе. Те же христианские законы, что дали евреям почву для накопления богатств (ведь им, как и лоллардам[], убежищем служили бури[]), оковали стальными обручами круг их привязанностей[]. Грех это или добродетель  лишь старый Никтоотец[] откроет нам в Судный день. Но человек, который так держится за то, что он именует своими правами на то, что он именует себе причитающимся,  он будет цепко держаться и за то, что он именует своими правами на ту, кого он именует своей женой. И пусть никакой окрестный сэр смайл[] не пожелает вола его, или жены его, или раба, или рабыни его, или осла его[]. Или ослицы его,  возгласил антифонно Бык Маллиган. С нашим любезным Биллом сурово обошлись,  любезно заметил мистер Супер, сама любезность. С какой волей?[] мягко вмешался Бык Маллиган.  Мы рискуем запутаться. Воля к жизни,  пустился в философию Джон Эглинтон,  была волею к смерти для бедной Энн, вдовы Вилла. ![] помолился Стивен.Воли к действию уж нетИ в помине много лет[] И все же она положена, охладелая, на эту, на второсортную кровать: поруганная царица[], хотя б вы и доказали, что в те дни кровать была такой же редкостью, как ныне автомобиль, а резьба на ней вызывала восторги семи приходов. На склоне дней своих она сошлась с проповедниками (один из них останавливался в Нью-Плейс и получал кварту хереса за счет города; однако не следует спрашивать, на какой кровати он спал) и прослышала, что у нее есть душа. Она прочла, или же ей прочли, книжицы из его котомки, предпочитая их Проказницам, и, облегчаясь в ночной сосуд, размышляла о Крючках и Петлях для Штанов Истинно Верующего и о Наидуховнейшей Табакерке, что Заставляет Чихать Наиблагочестивейшие Души[]. Венера изогнула свои уста в молитве. Жагала сраму: угрызения совести. Возраст, когда распутство, выдохшись, начинает себе отыскивать бога. История подтверждает это,    [].  Один возраст жизни сменяется другим. Однако мы знаем из высокоавторитетных источников, что худшие враги человека  его домашние и семья[]. Мне кажется, Рассел прав. Какое нам дело до его жены, до отца? Я бы сказал, что семейная жизнь существует только у поэтов семейного очага. Фальстаф не был человеком семейного очага. А для меня тучный рыцарь  венец всех его созданий.Тощий, откинулся он назад. Робкий, отрекись от сородичей своих[], жестоковыйных праведников[]. Робкий, в застолье с безбожниками он тщится избегать чаши[]. Так ему наказал родитель из Ольстера, из графства Антрим[].Навещает его тут в библиотеке ежеквартально. Мистер Маги, сэр, вас там желает видеть какой-то господин. Меня? Он говорит, что он ваш отец, сэр.Подайте ка мне Вордсворта[]. Входит Маги Мор Мэтью, в грубом сукне косматый керн[], на нем штаны с гульфиком на пуговицах, чулки забрызганы грязью десяти лесов, и ветка яблони-дичка в руках[].А твой? Он знает твоего старикана. Вдовец.Спеша из веселого Парижа в нищенскую лачугу к ее смертному ложу, на пристани я коснулся его руки. Голос, звучавший неожиданной теплотой. Ее лечит доктор Боб Кении. Взгляд, что желает мне добра. Не зная меня, однако. Отец,  произнес Стивен, пытаясь побороть безнадежность,  это неизбежное зло. Он написал знаменитую пьесу вскоре после смерти отца[]. Но если вы станете утверждать, что он, седеющий муж с двумя дочерьми на выданье, в возрасте тридцати пяти лет,       [], и добрых пятидесяти по своему опыту,  что он и есть безусый студиозус из Виттенберга, тогда вам придется утверждать, что его старая мать, уже лет семидесяти, это похотливая королева. Нет. Труп Джона Шекспира не скитается по ночам. Он с часу и на час гниет[]. Отец мирно почиет, сложивши бремя отцовства и передав сие мистическое состояние сыну. Каландрино[], герой Боккаччо, был первым и последним мужчиной, кто чувствовал, будто бы у него ребенок. Мужчина не знает отцовства в смысле сознательного порождения. Это  состоянье мистическое, апостольское преемство от единорождающего к единородному[]. Именно на этой тайне, а вовсе не на мадонне[], которую лукавый итальянский разум швырнул европейским толпам, стоит церковь, и стоит непоколебимо, ибо стоит, как сам мир, макро и микрокосм,  на пустоте. На недостоверном, невероятном. Возможно, что  [], родительный субъекта и объекта,  единственно подлинное в мире. Возможно, что отцовство  одна юридическая фикция. Где у любого сына такой отец, что любой сын должен его любить и сам он любого сына?Куда это тебя понесло, черт побери?Знаю. Заткнись. Ступай к черту. На то у меня причины.. . . [].Или ты обречен этим заниматься? Телесный стыд разделяет их настолько прочной преградой, что мировые анналы преступности, испещренные всеми иными видами распутств и кровосмесительств, почти не сообщают о ее нарушениях. Сыновья с матерями, отцы с дочерьми, лесбиянки-сестры, любовь, которая назвать себя не смеет, племянники с бабушками, узники с замочными скважинами, королевы с быками-рекордистами[]. Сын, пока не родился, портит фигуру; рождаясь, приносит муки, потом разделение привязанности, прибавку хлопот. И он мужчина: его восход  это закат отца, его молодость  отцу на зависть, его друг  враг отца.Я додумался до этого на рю Мсье-ле-Пренс[]. Что в природе их связывает? Миг слепой похоти.А я отец? А если бы был?Сморщенная неуверенная рука. Африканец Савеллий, хитрейший ересиарх из всех зверей полевых[], утверждал, что Сам же Отец  Свой Собственный Сын. Бульдог Аквинский[], которого ни один довод не мог поставить в тупик, опровергает его. Отлично: если отец, у которого нет сына, уже не отец, то может ли сын, у которого нет отца, быть сыном? Когда Ратлендбэконсаутхемптоншекспир[] или другой какой-нибудь бард с тем же именем из этой комедии ошибок написал Гамлета, он был не просто отцом своего сына, но, больше уже не будучи сыном, он был и он сознавал себя отцом всего своего рода, отцом собственного деда, отцом своего нерожденного внука, который, заметим в скобках, так никогда и не родился[], ибо природа, как полагает мистер Маги, не терпит совершенства[].Глаза эглинтоньи, вмиг оживившись, искорку удовольствия метнули украдкой. Весел и радостен пуританина взгляд, хоть игл полн тон.Польстить. Изредка. Но польстить. Сам себе отец,  пробормотал сам себе Сынмаллиган.  Постойте-постойте. Я забеременел. У меня нерожденное дитя в мозгу. Афина-Паллада! Пьеса! Пьеса, вот предмет[]! Дайте мне разрешиться.Он стиснул свой чреволоб акушерским жестом. Что до его семьи,  продолжал Стивен,  то имя матери его живет в Арденском лесу[]. Ее смертью навеяна у него сцена с Волумнией в Кориолане[]. Смерть его сына-мальчика  это сцена смерти юного Артура в Короле Иоанне. Гамлет, черный принц, это Гамнет Шекспир. Кто были девушки в Буре, в Перикле, в Зимней сказке  мы уже знаем. Кто была Клеопатра, котел с мясом в земле Египетской, и кто Крессида, и кто Венера[], мы можем догадываться. Но есть и еще один член его семейства, чей след  на его страницах. Интрига усложняется,  заметил Джон Эглинтон.Библиоквакер-прыгун вернулся, припрыгивая на цыпочках, личина его подрагивает, суетливо подпрыгивает, поквакивает.Дверь затворилась. Келья. Огни.Они внимают. Трое. Они.Я. Ты. Он. Они.Начнемте ж, судари.Стивен. У него было три брата, Гилберт, Эдмунд, Ричард. Гилберт рассказывал в старости неким благородным господам, как однова случись Господин Кассир пожаловали ему вот не соврать дармовой билет и как видал он там в этом самом Лонноне свово брательника что сочиняет пиесы господина Виля в камеди со знатною потасовкой а у того здоровый детина сидел на закорках. Колбаса, что продавали в партере, преисполнила Гилбертову душу восторгом. Он сгинул бесследно  но некий Эдмунд и некий Ричард присутствуют в сочинениях любящего Вильяма.Магиглинджон. Имена! Что значит имя?[]Супер. Ричард, понимаете, это же мое имя. Я надеюсь, у вас найдется доброе словечко для Ричарда, понимаете, уж ради меня.Смех.Бык Маллиган (, ).Тут промолвил медик ДикСвоему коллеге Дэви[]Стивен. В его троице черных Биллов, злокозненных смутьянов, Яго, Ричард-горбун[] и Эдмунд в Короле Лире, двоим присвоены имена злых дядюшек. И кстати еще, эту последнюю пьесу он писал или собирался писать в то самое время, когда его брат Эдмунд умирал в Саутуорке.Супер. Я надеюсь, что на орехи попадет Эдмунду. Я не хочу, чтобы Ричард, мой тезкаСмех.Квакерлистер ( ). Но тот, кто незапятнанное имя мое крадет[]Стивен (). Он запрятал свое имя, прекрасное имя, Вильям[], в своих пьесах, дав его где статисту, где клоуну, как на картинах у старых итальянцев художник иногда пишет самого себя где-нибудь в неприметном уголку. Но он выставил его напоказ в Сонетах, где Вильям преизобилует. Как для Джона оГонта[], его имя дорого для него, столь же дорого, как щит и герб, ради которых он пресмыкался, на черном поясе золотое копье с серебряным острием, [],  и дороже, чем слава величайшего в стране потрясателя сцены[]. Что значит имя? Этот вопрос каждый задает себе в детстве, когда впервые пишет то имя, которое, как объясняют ему, есть его имя.Звезда, сияющая и днем[], огнедышащий дракон, поднялась в небесах при его рождении. Она одиноко сияла средь бела дня, ярче, чем Венера ночью, а по ночам светила над дельтой Кассиопеи, созвездия, что раскинулось среди звезд, изображая его инициал. Его взгляд останавливался на ней, стоящей низко над горизонтом, восточной медведицы, когда в полночный час он проходил летними дремлющими полями, возвращаясь из Шоттери[] и из ее объятий.Они оба довольны. Я тоже.Только не говори им, что ему было девять лет, когда она исчезла.И из ее объятий.Ждешь, пока тебя улестят и обольстят[]. Эх ты, тихоня. Кто тебя станет обольщать?Читай в небесах. Аутонтиморуменос. Бус Стефануменос[]. Где же твое созвездие? Стиви-Стиви, съел все сливы. ..:  . :  .      ..[]. Но что же это было, мистер Дедал?  спросил квакер-библиотекарь.  Какое-нибудь небесное явление? Ночью  звезда,  отвечал Стивен.  Днем же  облачный столп[].О чем еще сказать?Стивен окинул взглядом свою шляпу, трость, башмаки.Стефанос[], мой венец. Мой меч. А эти башмаки его только уродуют ноги. Надо купить пару. Носки дырявые. И носовой платок надо. Вы неплохо обыгрываете его имя,  признал Джон Эглинтон.  А ваше собственное довольно странно. Как мне кажется, оно объясняет ваш эксцентрический склад ума.Я, Маги и Маллиган.Легендарный искусник[]. Человек-сокол. Ты летал. Куда же? Нью-хейвен  Дьепп, низшим классом. Париж и обратно. Зуек. Икар.  []. Упал, барахтается в волнах, захлебывается. Зуек, вот ты кто[]. Быть зуйком.Мистер Супер в тихом воодушевлении поднял блокнот: Это очень интересно, потому что мотив брата, понимаете, встречается и в древнеирландских мифах. Как раз то, о чем вы говорите. Трое братьев Шекспиров. И то же самое у Гриммов, понимаете, в сказках. Там всегда третий брат  настоящий супер-герой, он женится на спящей принцессе, и все такое.Супер из супер-братьев. Хороший, получше, супер.Библиоквакер припрыгал и стал подле. Мне бы хотелось полюбопытствовать,  начал он,  о ком это вы из братьев Как я понял, вы намекаете, что были предосудительные отношения с одним из братьев Или, может быть, это я забегаю вперед?Он поймал себя с поличным  поглядел на всех  смолк.Помощник позвал с порога: Мистер Листер! Отец Дайнин просит[] Ах, отец Дайнин! Сейчас-сейчас!Быстрым шагом час-час с бодрым скрипом час-час он час-час удалился.Джон Эглинтон стал в позицию. Ну что ж,  произнес он.  Посмотрим, что у вас найдется сказать про Ричарда и Эдмунда. Вероятно, вы их приберегли напоследок? Ожидать, чтобы вы запомнили двух благородных родичей[], дядюшку Ричи и дядюшку Эдмунда,  парировал Стивен,  как видно, значит ожидать слишком многого. Братьев забывают так же легко, как зонтики.Зуек.Где брат твой[]? У аптекаря. Мой оселок[]. Он, потом Крэнли, потом Маллиган  а теперь эти. Речи, речи. Но действуй же. Действуй речью. Они насмешничают, проверяя тебя. Действуй. Отвечай на действия.Зуек.Я устал от собственного голоса, голоса Исава. Полцарства за глоток[].Вперед. Вы скажете, что это просто имена из тех хроник, откуда он брал себе материал для пьес. А почему тогда он выбрал эти, а не другие? Ричард, горбатый злодей, бастард, приударяет за овдовевшей Энн (что значит имя?), улещает и обольщает ее, злодей  веселую вдову. Ричард-завоеватель, третий брат, царствует после Вильяма-побежденного. И все остальные четыре акта драмы не то что зависят, а прямо-таки висят на этом первом. Ричард  единственный из всех королей, кого Шекспир не ограждает почтенья долгом, суетным как мир[]. Почему побочный сюжет в Короле Лире, где действует Эдмунд, утащен из Аркадии Сидни и пристегнут к кельтской легенде доисторической древности? Уж так делал Вилл,  вступился Джон Эглинтон.  Это не значит, что мы сегодня должны склеивать скандинавскую сагу с обрывком романа Мередита.  -?  как сказал бы Мур. У него и Богемия находится на берегу моря[], а Одиссей цитирует Аристотеля. Почему?  продолжал Стивен, сам отвечая себе.  Потому что тема брата-обманщика, брата-захватчика, брата-прелюбодея или же брата, в котором все это сразу, была тем для Шекспира, чем нищие не были: тем, что всегда с собой[]. Мотив изгнания, изгнания из сердца, изгнания из дома, звучит непрерывно, начиная с Двух веронцев и до того момента, когда Просперо ломает жезл свой, зарывает в землю и топит книги в глубине морской[]. Этот мотив раздваивается в середине его жизни, продолжается в другом, повторяется, протасис, эпитасис, катастасис, катастрофа[]. Он повторяется вновь, когда герой уже на краю могилы, а его замужняя дочь Сьюзен, вся в папочку, обвиняется в прелюбодействе[]. Однако он-то и был тот первородный грех, что затемнил его понятия, расслабил волю и вселил в него упорную тягу ко злу[]. Таковы точные слова господ епископов Манутских.Первородный грех, и как первородный грех содеян он был другим, грехами которого он также грешил. Он кроется между строками последних слов, им написанных, он застыл на его надгробии[], под которым не суждено было покоиться останкам его жены. Время над ним не властно. Красота и безмятежность не вытеснили его. В тысячах видов он рассеян повсюду в мире, созданном им, в Много шума из ничего, дважды  в Как вам это понравится, в Буре, в Гамлете, в Мере за меру  и во всех прочих пьесах, коих я не читал.Он рассмеялся, чтобы ум его сбросил оковы его ума. Истина посредине,  подытожил судия Эглинтон.  Он призрак и он принц. Он  все во всем[]. Именно так,  подтвердил Стивен.  Мальчишка из первого акта  это зрелый муж из акта пятого. Все во всем. В Цимбелине, в Отелло он сводник и рогоносец. Он действует и отвечает на действия. Влюбленный в идеал или в извращенье, он, как Хозе, убивает настоящую Кармен. Его неумолимый рассудок  это Яго, одержимый рогобоязнью и жаждущий, чтобы мавр в нем страдал, не зная покоя. Р-рога! Р-рога!  Рык Маллиган прорычал похабно.  Опасный звук! Приводит он мужей в испуг![]Темный купол уловил и откликнулся. Да, Яго! Что за характер!  воскликнул неиспугавшийся Джон Эглинтон. Когда все уже сказано, остается лишь согласиться с Дюма-сыном. (Или с Дюма-отцом?) После Господа Бога больше всех создал Шекспир[]. Мужчины не занимают его[], и женщины тоже,  молвил Стивен.  Всю жизнь свою проведя в отсутствии, он возвращается на тот клочок земли, где был рожден и где оставался всегда, и в юные и в зрелые годы, немой свидетель. Здесь его жизненное странствие кончено, и он сажает в землю тутовое дерево[]. Потом умирает. Действие окончено. Могильщики зарывают Гамлета-отца и Гамлета-сына. Он наконец-то король и принц: в смерти, с подобающей музыкой. И оплакиваемый  хотя сперва ими же убитый и преданный  всеми нежными и чувствительными сердцами, ибо будь то у дублинских или датских жен, жалость к усопшим  единственный супруг, с которым они не пожелают развода. Если вам нравится эпилог, всмотритесь в него подольше: процветающий Просперо  вознагражденная добродетель, Лиззи[] дедушкина крошка-резвушка и дядюшка Ричи[] порок, сосланный поэтическим правосудием в места, уготованные для плохих негров. Большой занавес. Во внешнем мире он нашел воплощенным то, что жило как возможность в его внутреннем мире.Метерлинк говорит: Если сегодня Сократ выйдет из дому, он обнаружит мудреца, сидящего у своих дверей. Если нынче Иуда пустится в путь, этот путь его приведет к Иуде []. Каждая жизнь  множество дней, чередой один за другим. Мы бредем сквозь самих себя, встречая разбойников, призраков, великанов, стариков, юношей, жен, вдов, братьев по духу, но всякий раз встречая самих себя. Тот драматург[], что написал фолио мира сего, и написал его скверно (сначала Он дал нам свет, а солнце  два дня спустя), властелин всего сущего, кого истые римляне из католиков зовут  , бог-палач, вне всякого сомнения, есть все во всем в каждом из нас, он конюх и он мясник, и он был бы также сводником и рогоносцем, если б не помешало то, что в устроительстве небесном[], как предсказал Гамлет, нет больше браков и человек во славе, ангел-андрогин, есть сам в себе и жена. Эврика!  возопил Бык Маллиган.  Эврика!Вдруг счастливо просияв, он вскочил и единым махом очутился у стола Эглинтона. Вы позволите?  спросил он.  Господь возговорил к Малахии.Он принялся что-то кропать на библиотечном бланке.Будешь уходить  захвати бланков со стойки. Кто уже в браке[],  возвестил мистер Супер, сладостный герольд,  пусть так и живут, все, кроме одного. Остальные пускай по-прежнему воздерживаются.В браке отнюдь не состоя, он засмеялся, глядя на Эглинтона Иоанна, искусств бакалавра[], холостяка.Не имея ни жены, ни интрижки, повсюду опасаясь сетей, оба еженощно смакуют Укрощение строптивой с вариантами и комментариями. Вы устроили надувательство,  без околичностей заявил Джон Эглинтон Стивену.  Вы нас заставили проделать весь этот путь, чтобы в конце показать банальнейший треугольник. Вы сами-то верите в собственную теорию? Нет,  отвечал Стивен незамедлительно. А вы не запишете все это?  спросил мистер Супер.  Вам нужно из этого сделать диалог, понимаете, как те платонические диалоги, что сочинял Уайльд[].Джон Эклектикон улыбнулся сугубо. В таком случае,  сказал он,  я не вижу, почему вы должны ожидать какой-то платы за это, коль скоро вы сами в это не верите. Доуден верит, что в Гамлете имеется какая-то тайна, но больше ничего говорить не желает. Герр Бляйбтрой[], тот господин, с которым Пайпер встречался в Берлине, развивает версию насчет Ратленда и думает, что секрет таится в стратфордском памятнике. Пайпер говорил, будто бы он собирается нанести визит нынешнему герцогу и доказать ему, что пьесы были написаны его предком. Это будет такой сюрприз для его сиятельства. Однако он верит в свою теорию.Верую, Господи, помоги моему неверию[]. То есть, помоги мне верить или помоги мне не верить? Кто помогает верить? []. А кто  не верить? Другой малый. Вы единственный из всех авторов Даны, кто требует звонкой монеты[]. И я не уверен насчет ближайшего номера. Фред Райен хочет, чтобы ему оставили место для статьи по экономике.Фредрайн. Две звонких монеты он мне ссудил. Чтоб ты снялся с мели.Экономика. За одну гинею,  сказал Стивен,  вы можете опубликовать эту беседу.Бык Маллиган перестал, посмеиваясь, кропать и, посмеиваясь, поднялся.Чинным голосом, с медоточивым коварством он известил: Нанеся визит барду Клинку в его летней резиденции на верхней Мекленбург-стрит[], я обнаружил его погруженным в изучение   [], в обществе двух гонорейных леди, Нелли-Свеженькой и Розали, шлюхи с угольной пристани.Он оборвал себя. Пошли, Клинк. Пошли, скиталец Энгус с птицами[].Пошли, Клинк. Ты уже все доел после нас. О, я, разумеется, позабочусь о требухе и объедках для тебя.Стивен поднялся.Жизнь  множество дней. Этот кончится. Мы вас увидим вечером,  сказал Джон Эглинтон.   []. Мур надеется, что Мэйлахи Маллиган будет там.Бык Маллиган раскланялся панамой и бланком. Мсье Мур,  сказал он,  просвещающий ирландскую молодежь по французской части. Я там буду. Пошли. Клинк, бардам надлежит выпить. Ты можешь ступать прямо?ПосмеивающийсяНакачиваться до одиннадцати. Вечернее развлечение ирландцев[].ПаяцСтивен двигался за паяцемОднажды была у нас дискуссия в национальной библиотеке. Шекс. Потом.Идет спина пая: за ней шагаю я. Наступаю ему на пятки.Стивен, попрощавшись, как в воду опущенный, двигался за паяцем, шутом, ладнопричесанным, свежевыбритым, из сводчатой кельи на свет дневной, грохочущий и бездумный.Что ж я постиг?

Мне так и чуялся пот монашьих причинных мест[].Он смачно сплюнул.Забыл: что он никоим образом не забыл как его выпорол этот паршивый Люси[]. И еще: он бросил     []. И почему не было других детей? И первенцем была девочка?Задним умом. Беги, возвращайся.Суровый затворник все еще там (имеет свой кусок пирога) и сладостный юнец, миньончик[], федоновы шелковистые кудри приятно гладить[].Э э Я тут вот хотел забыл сказать э-э Лонгворт и Маккерди Аткинсон[] там тоже былиПак Маллиган, легко приплясывая, стрекотал:Заслышу ль ругань в переулкеИль встречу шлюху на прогулке,Как сразу мысль на этом фонеОб Ф.Маккерди Аткинсоне,Что с деревянною ногой,С ним тут же рядышком другой,Чья вкус винца не знает глотка, Маги, лишенный подбородка.У них жениться духу нет,И онанизм  весь их секрет[].Фиглярствуй дальше. Познай сам себя. Остановился ниже меня, насмешливо мерит взглядом. Я останавливаюсь. Шут ты кладбищенский,  посетовал Бык Маллиган:  Синг уже перестал ходить в черном, чтоб быть как люди. Черны только вороны, попы и английский уголь.Прерывистый смешок слетел с его уст. Лонгворт чуть ли не окочурился,  сообщил он,  из-за того, что ты написал про эту старую крысу Грегори[]. Ах ты, надравшийся жидоиезуит из инквизиции! Она тебя пристраивает в газету, а ты в благодарность разносишь ее писульки к этакой матери. Разве нельзя было в стиле Йейтса?Он продолжал спускаться, выделывая свои ужимки и плавно балансируя руками: Прекраснейшая из книг, что появились у нас в стране на моем веку[].Невольно вспоминаешь Гомера.Он остановился у подножия лестницы. У меня зародилась пьеса! Бесовское измышление[]!  объявил он торжественно.Зал с мавританскими колоннами, скрещивающиеся тени. Окончен мавританский танец девятерых в шляпах индексов.Мелодичным голосом, с гибкими интонациями. Бык Маллиган принялся зачитывать свою скрижаль:Каждый сам себе жена,или Медовый месяц в руке(национальное аморалите в трех оргазмах)сочинение Мудака МаллиганаОн обратил к Стивену ликующее мурло: Я опасаюсь, что маскировка слишком прозрачна. Но слушай же.Он продолжал читать, : Действующие лица:ТОБИ ДРОЧИНЬСКИЙ (задроченный полячок)МАНДАВОШ (лесной разбойник)МЕДИК ДИК и МЕДИК ДЭВИ (двое за одного)МАТУШКА ГРОГАН (водородица)НЕЛЛИ СВЕЖЕНЬКАЯ и РОЗАЛИ (шлюха с угольной пристани).Он шел впереди Стивена, похохатывая, болтая головой туда и сюда  и весело обращался к теням, душам людей: О, та ночь в Кэмден-холл, когда дочери Эрина[] должны были поднимать юбки, чтобы переступить через тебя, лежащего в своей винноцветной, разноцветной и изобильной блевотине! Невиннейший из сыновей Эрина,  откликнулся Стивен,  ради которого когда-либо юбки поднимались.Почти у самого выхода, ощутив чье-то присутствие сзади, он посторонился.Расстаться. Подходящий момент. Ну, а куда? Если сегодня Сократ выйдет из дому, если нынче Иуда пустится в путь. Какая разница? Предрешенное пространство ожидает меня в предрешенное время  неотменимо.Моя воля  и его воля, лицом к лицу. Между ними бездна.Человек прошел между ними, вежливо кланяясь. Еще раз здравствуйте,  отвечал Бык Маллиган.Портик.Здесь я следил за птицами, гадая по их полету[]. Энгус с птицами. Они улетают, прилетают. Этой ночью и я летал. Летал с легкостью. Люди дивились. А потом квартал девок. Он мне протягивал нежную как сливки дыню.Входи. Ты увидишь. Странствующий жид,  прошептал Бык Маллиган в комическом ужасе.  Ты не заметил его глаза? Он на тебя смотрел с вожделением. Страшусь тебя, о старый мореход[]. Клинк, ты на краю гибели. Обзаводись поясом целомудрия.Оксенфордские нравы[].День. Тачка солнца над дугой моста[].Темная спина двигалась впереди. Шаги леопарда, спустился, проходит воротами, под остриями решетки.Они шли следом.Продолжай оскорблять меня. Говори.Приветливый воздух подчеркивал выступы стен[] на Килдер-стрит. Ни одной птицы. Из труб над домами подымались два хрупких пера, раскидывались оперением и под веющей мягкостью мягко таяли.Прекрати сражаться. Мир цимбелиновых друидов, мистериальный: просторная земля  алтарь.Хвала богам![] Пусть дым от алтарейНесется к небу!Эпизод []Начальник дома[], высокопреподобный Джон Конми, О.И., сойдя по ступенькам своего крыльца, опустил плоские часы обратно во внутренний карман. Без пяти три. Прекрасное время для прогулки в Артейн. Значит, как фамилия мальчика? Дигнам. Да.     []. С этим следовало к брату Свону[]. Письмо мистера Каннингема. Да. Оказать ему эту услугу, если можно. Добрый католик, соблюдает обряды, помогает в сборах на церковь.Одноногий матрос, продвигаясь вперед ленивыми бросками своих костылей, прорычал какие-то звуки. Возле монастыря сестер милосердия он оборвал броски и протянул фуражку за подаянием к высокопреподобному Джону Конми, О.И. Отец Конми благословил его под щедрыми лучами солнца, памятуя, что в кошельке у него только серебряная крона.Отец Конми свернул к Маунтджой-сквер. Мысли его ненадолго задержались на солдатах и матросах, которые лишились конечностей под пушечными ядрами и доживают остаток дней в нищенских приютах, а также на словах кардинала Уолси[]: Если бы я служил Богу своему, как я служил своему королю. Он бы не покинул меня в дни старости . Он шел под деревьями, в тени играющей зайчиками листвы, навстречу же ему приближалась супруга мистера Дэвида Шихи, Ч.П. Благодарю вас, просто прекрасно. А вы, святой отец?Отец Конми себя чувствовал поистине превосходно. Он собирался в Бакстон на воды. А как ее сыновья, у них все хорошо в Бельведере? Правда? Отец Конми был поистине очень рад это слышать. А как сам мистер Шихи? Еще в Лондоне. Ну да, конечно, парламент ведь еще заседает. Какая прекрасная погода, право, на редкость. Да, это весьма возможно, что отец Бернард Вохен[] возобновит свои проповеди. О да: огромный успех. Поистине необыкновенный человек.Отец Конми был очень рад повидать супругу мистера Дэвида Шихи, Ч.П., и рад, что она так хорошо выглядит. Он попросил передать его наилучшие пожелания мистеру Дэвиду Шихи, Ч.П. Да, он непременно их навестит. Всего доброго, миссис Шихи.Отец Конми приподнял свою шелковую шляпу в прощальном приветствии стеклярусу ее мантильи, чернильно поблескивающему на солнце. И вновь улыбнулся, уходя. Он знал, что его зубы почищены пастой с пальмовым маслом.Отец Конми шел и на ходу улыбался, вспоминая чудаковатые глаза отца Бернарда Вохена и его сочные лондонские словечки. Пилат! Да что ж ты не разогнал весь этот сброд в шею?Но в рвении ему не откажешь. Никоим образом. И, несомненно, приносил много пользы, на свой манер. Этого тоже не отнять. Он говорил, что любит Ирландию и любит ирландцев. Кстати, ведь из хорошей семьи, кто бы подумал?Кажется, из Уэльса.О, берегитесь, чтоб не забыть[]. Письмо к отцу-провинциалу[].Отец Конми остановил трех малышей-школьников на углу Маунтджой-сквер.Да: они были из Бельведера. Из приготовительного, ага. И хорошо себя ведут в школе? О-о. Ну, тогда очень хорошо. А как тебя зовут? Джек Сохен. А тебя? Джер. Галлахер[]. А этого молодого человека? Его звали Бранни Лайнем.Ну, как приятно носить такое красивое имя.Отец Конми, достав письмо из внутреннего кармана, вручил его юному Бранни Лайнему и указал на красный столбик-ящик на углу Фицгиббон-стрит. Смотри, только сам не проскочи в ящик, малыш,  пошутил он.Мальчуганы, шестиглазея на отца Конми, засмеялись: О, сэр! Ну-с, покажи, как ты умеешь опускать письма,  сказал отец Конми.Юный Бранни Лайнем перебежал через дорогу и сунул письмо отца Конми к отцу провинциалу в щель ярко-красного почтового ящика. Отец Конми улыбнулся, кивнул, опять улыбнулся и зашагал по восточной стороне Маунтджой-сквер.Мистер Дэнис Дж.Маджинни, учитель танцев и пр., в цилиндре, в серо-голубом сюртуке с шелковыми лацканами, в белом галстуке, в узких сиреневых брюках, канареечных перчатках и лаковых остроносых штиблетах, выступая с внушительною осанкою, наипочтительнейше свернул на обочину, обгоняя леди Максвелл на углу Дигнамс-корт.А это не миссис Макгиннесс?Миссис Макгиннесс, статная, седовласая, поклонилась отцу Конми с соседнего тротуара, по которому она величаво проплывала. Отец Конми улыбнулся и отдал поклон. Как она поживает?Какая великолепная манера. Есть нечто в ней, прямо как у Марии Стюарт.И только подумать  процентщица. Ну и ну! С такой как бы это сказать?с такой царственной миной.Отец Конми следовал по Грейт-Чарльз-стрит, поглядывая налево на закрытую протестантскую церковь. Преподобный Т.Р.Грин, бакалавр искусств, будет (..)[] читать проповедь. Он у них называется бенефициарием. По-латыни, благодетель. Решил их облагодетельствовать проповедью. Но будем, однако, снисходительны.Непреодолимое неведение[]. Действуют по мере света, им данной.Отец Конми повернул за угол и зашагал по Северной окружной.Удивительно, что нет трамвайной линии на такой важной магистрали.Бесспорно, тут должна быть.С Ричмонд-стрит высыпали гурьбой школьники с ранцами за спиной и все как один приподняли измятые фуражки. Отец Конми несколько раз благосклонно покивал им. Из школы Христианских братьев.С правой стороны до отца Конми донесся запах ладана. Церковь Святого Иосифа, Портленд-роу. Для престарелых и добродетельных особ женского пола.Отец Конми обнажил голову пред совершающимся Святым Таинством. Да, добродетельны  но иногда просто невыносимы.Проходя мимо особняка Олдборо[], отец Конми подумал про этого расточительного аристократа. А теперь тут какая-то контора или нечто подобное.Отец Конми вышел на Северную Стрэнд-роуд, где его приветствовал мистер Вильям Галлахер, стоявший в дверях своей лавки. Отец Конми приветствовал мистера Вильяма Галлахера и ощутил запахи, исходившие от пластов бекона и объемистых кубов масла. Он миновал табачную торговлю Грогана, опершись на которую газетные щиты сообщали об ужасной катастрофе в Нью-Йорке. В Америке то и дело подобные происшествия. Какое несчастье для людей вот так умереть, без приуготовления. Хотя еще остается акт совершенного сокрушения[].Отец Конми прошел мимо трактира Дэниэла Бергина, возле окон которого прислонились к стене двое праздных мужчин. Они поклонились ему и получили ответный поклон.Отец Конми миновал похоронное заведение Г.Дж.ОНила, где Корни Келлехер, жуя сухую травинку, подбивал сумму в своем гроссбухе. Констебль, делавший обход, приветствовал отца Конми, и отец Конми приветствовал констебля. В витрине Юкстеттера, торговца свининой, отец Конми окинул взглядом свиные колбасы, белые, черные и красные, свернутые аккуратными кольцами.Под деревьями Чарлвилл-мэлл отец Конми увидел причаленную торфяную баржу, свесившую голову лошадь в лямках и лодочника в грязной соломенной шляпе, который сидел на барже, покуривая и глядя на ветку тополя над головой. Картина была идиллической  и отец Конми задумался о мудром провидении Творца, создавшего торф в болотах, дабы люди могли его извлекать оттуда и привозить в город и делать из него топливо, согревающее домы бедняков.На мосту Ньюкомен высокопреподобный Джон Конми, О.И., из церкви святого Франциска Ксаверия, что на Верхней Гардинер-стрит, сел в трамвай, идущий от центра.С трамвая, идущего к центру, на мост Ньюкомен сошел преподобный Николае Дадли, викарий церкви святой Агаты, что на Северной Вильям-стрит.На мосту Ньюкомен отец Конми сел в трамвай, идущий от центра, поскольку он не любил ходить пешком по грязной дороге мимо Мад-айленд.Отец Конми уселся в углу вагона, аккуратно засунув синий билетик в глазок одной из своих толстых лайковых перчаток, а четыре шиллинга, шестипенсовик и пять монеток по пенни скользнули в его кошелек с ладони, обтянутой другою толстою лайковою перчаткою. Проезжая мимо церкви, увитой плющом, он размышлял о том, что контролер непременно является тогда, когда по беспечности выбросишь свой билет. Торжественный вид пассажиров казался отцу Конми излишним для такой краткой и дешевой поездки. Отец Конми любил непринужденную обстановку.День был безмятежным. Джентльмен в очках, сидевший напротив отца Конми, перестал что-то объяснять и опустил взгляд. Жена его, подумал отец Конми.Едва заметный зевок чуть-чуть приоткрыл рот жены джентльмена в очках. Она подняла маленький кулачок в перчатке, зевнула опять столь же деликатно, похлопывая себя по губам своим маленьким кулачком, и улыбнулась чуть-чуть, мягко-мягко.Запах ее духов привлек внимание отца Конми. Его внимание также привлекло, что неуклюжий мужчина по другую сторону от нее сидит на самом краешке своего сиденья.Отец Конми, стоя на амвоне, не без труда вложил гостию в рот неуклюжего старика с трясущейся головой.Трамвай остановился на мосту Эннсли и уже трогался снова, когда какая-то старушка неожиданно поднялась к выходу. Кондуктор дернул за веревку звонка, чтобы остановить трамвай для нее. Она вышла с корзинкой и с рыночной плетенкой. Отец Конми видел, как кондуктор помогал ей сойти с этою корзинкою и плетенкой,  и, зная, что она чуть не проехала дальше, чем полагалось за пенни, отец Конми подумал, что она была одной из тех добрых душ, которым всегда надо повторять по два раза, благословляю тебя, дитя мое , что грехи им отпущены, молись за меня[]. Но ведь у них столько тревог в жизни, столько забот, бедные создания.С афишных щитов мистер Юджин Стрэттон ухмылялся отцу Конми толстыми негритянскими губами.Отец Конми подумал о душах всех чернокожих, темнокожих и желтокожих людей, о своей проповеди на тему о святом Петре Клавере, О.И. и африканской миссии, о распространении истинной веры и о миллионах черных, коричневых и желтых душ, что не успели принять крещенья водой, когда их смертный час подкрался яко тать в нощи. Как полагал отец Конми, в той книге бельгийского иезуита[],    [], отстаивалась разумная точка зрения. Ведь все миллионы человеческих душ, что не были (..) обращены в истинную веру, были, тем не менее, души, которые сотворил Господь по Своему образу и подобию. Все это были Божьи души, сотворенные Богом. И отцу Конми казалось жаль, что все они должны быть потеряны, как пустые отходы, если так можно выразиться.На остановке Хоут-роуд отец Конми высадился и, в ответ на прощальный поклон кондуктора, также поклонился ему.Малахайд роуд была безлюдна. Отцу Конми нравились и эта улица и ее название. Веселый звон колоколов над Малахайд плывет[]. Лорд Толбот де Малахайд -по прямой линии наследный лорд-адмирал Малахайда и прилежащих морей. Свадебные колокола, и тут же  набат, к оружию, и она оказывается девицей, супругою и вдовой в один день. То были стародавние дни, пора беззаботных городков, не знавших крамолы, давняя баронская старина.Отец Конми, продолжая путь, подумал о своей небольшой книжке Баронская старина[] и о той книге, которую можно было бы написать о домах иезуитов и о Мэри Рочфорт[], дочери лорда Моулсворта, первой графине Бельведер.Печальная женщина, немолодая уже, одиноко бродила по берегам озера Эннел, Мэри, первая графиня Бельведер, печально бродившая вечерами, и всплеск выдры, нырнувшей в воду, не вызывал у нее ни удивления, ни испуга.Кто мог знать правду? Не лорд Бельведер, снедаемый ревностью, и не ее исповедник, если только она не совершала прелюбодеяния до конца, до      [], с братом своего мужа? Она бы исповедалась лишь наполовину, если бы согрешила не до конца, женщины поступают так. И знали бы только Бог, и она, и он, брат ее мужа.Отец Конми думал о неумолимом плотском влечении, без которого не может, однако, продлиться род людской на земле, и о путях Божиих, которые не суть пути наши.Дон Джон Конми, продолжая идти, перенесся во времена оны. Он был там почитаем и добр. Он хранил в своей памяти исповедальные тайны и улыбался улыбающимся благородным лицам в гостиных с навощенным паркетом, с пышными гроздьями плодов по плафонам. И руки жениха и невесты, благородного и благородной, соединял ладонями дон Джон Конми.Стоял чудный день.Сквозь калитку на поле отцу Конми показались гряды капусты, кочаны кланялись ему, широко разводя нижние листья. Небо показало ему стадо небольших белых облачков, медленно плывущих по ветру. [] говорят французы. Меткое слово и такое уютное.Отец Конми, читая молитвенное правило, следил за барашками облаков над Рэткоффи. Поля Клонгоуза покалывали своей стерней его лодыжки в тонких носках. По вечерам он гулял там, творя молитвы, и слушал возгласы мальчиков, занятых своими играми, юные возгласы в тихом вечернем воздухе.Он был у них ректором  и правил над ними с кротостью.Отец Конми снял перчатки и вынул свой молитвенник с красными уголками.Закладка слоновой кости указывала страницу.Час девятый[]. Это надо было прочесть еще до обеда. Но пришла леди Максвелл.Отец Конми прочитал мысленно Отче наш и Аве Мария и перекрестился.   [].Он шел в спокойствии, неслышно читая службу девятого часа, шагал и шагал, читая, пока не дошел до Реш[] в  :    :      [].Раскрасневшийся юноша выбрался на тропу через просвет в живой изгороди, за ним девушка с поникшими полевыми ромашками в руке. Юноша поспешно приподнял свою шляпу; девушка поспешно поклонилась и старательно принялась снимать с юбки приставший к ней стебелек.Отец Конми степенно благословил обоих и перевернул тоненькую страничку молитвенника. Шин:     :       [].Корни Келлехер захлопнул толстый гроссбух и глянул лениво на сосновую крышку гроба, стоявшую на часах в углу. Он выпрямился, подошел к ней и, повертев вокруг оси, осмотрел ее поверхность и медные украшения. Жуя сухую травинку, он положил крышку на пол и отошел к выходу. Там он надвинул шляпу так, чтобы тень падала на глаза, и прислонился к косяку двери, бесцельно глядя на улицу.Отец Джон Конми на мосту Ньюкомен сел в трамвай в сторону Доллимаунта.Корни Келлехер, сомкнув свои огромные башмаки, в надвинутой на лоб шляпе, глазел по сторонам, жуя сухую травинку.Констебль С, патрульный на обходе, остановился рядом с ним скоротать минутку. Отличный день, мистер Келлехер. Угу,  пробурчал Корни Келлехер. Только вот душно,  сказал констебль.Корни Келлехер пустил дугою сквозь зубы беззвучную струю травяного сока, а щедрая белая ручка бросила монетку из окна на Экклс-стрит. Ну, что хорошенького?  спросил он. Я видел означенного субъекта вчера вечером,  сказал, понизив голос, констебль.Одноногий матрос проковылял за угол аптеки Макконнелла, обогнул тележку мороженщика от Рабайотти и запрыгал на костылях по Экклс-стрит.Приближаясь к Ларри ОРурку, стоявшему у себя в дверях без пиджака, он вызывающе рявкнул: За Англию Резкими раскачивающимися рывками он продвинулся вперед, мимо Кейти и Буди Дедал, остановился и рявкнул: дом и красу[].Бледному, изглоданному заботой лицу Дж.Дж.ОМоллоя было сказано, что мистер Лэмберт на складе, с посетителем.Грузная дама остановилась, вынула медяк из своего кошелька и бросила в протянутую к ней фуражку. Матрос пробурчал благодарность, угрюмо глянул на безучастные окна и, опустив низко голову, сделал еще четыре раскачивающихся рывка вперед.Потом остановился и в сердцах рявкнул: За Англию Двое босоногих мальчишек, сосущих длинные палочки лакрицы, остановились возле него, разинув на искалеченный обрубок свои желтослюнявые рты.Он мощными рывками продвинулся еще вперед, остановился, поднял к окну голову и прорычал низким басом: дом и красу .Веселое щебетанье и посвистыванье за окном еще продолжалось один-два такта и смолкло. Занавеску на окне отодвинули в сторону. Табличка Сдаются квартиры без мебели соскользнула с рамы и упала. Мелькнула щедрая рука, оголенная и полная, выглядывающая, как видно было, из белой комбинации и тесных бретелек нижней юбки. Женская ручка бросила монету сквозь прутья решетки. Она упала на тротуар.Один из мальчишек подбежал, поднял ее и опустил в фуражку певца со словами: Вот она, сэр.Кейти и Буди Дедал ввалились в двери наполненной паром кухни. Ты отнесла книжки?  спросила Буди.Мэгги у плиты дважды потыкала палкой, уминая сероватую массу в булькающих мыльных пузырях, и отерла лоб. За них не дают ничего,  сказала она.Отец Коими шагал по полям в Клонгоузе, стерня покалывала его лодыжки в тонких носках. А ты где пробовала?  спросила Буди. У Макгиннесс.Буди топнула ногой и швырнула на стол свой ранец. Чтоб этой толстомордой ни дна ни покрышки!  выкрикнула она.Кейти подошла к плите и поглядела, прищурившись. А в чугуне что?  спросила она. Рубашки,  сказала Мэгги.Буди сердито крикнула: Черт побери, выходит, есть нечего?Кейти, приподняв крышку котелка подолом своей запачканной юбки, спросила: А в этом что?Густой пахучий пар поднялся в ответ. Суп гороховый,  сказала Мэгги. Это откуда же?  спросила Кейти. Сестра Мэри Патрик,  сказала Мэгги.Служитель позвонил в колокольчик. Брень!Буди уселась за стол и жадно воскликнула: Давай-ка его сюда!Мэгги налила густого желтого супу из котелка ей в тарелку. Кейти, сидевшая напротив Буди, спокойно сказала, на кончике пальца поднося ко рту хлебные крошки: Хорошо, что хоть это есть. А где Дилли? Пошла отца встречать,  ответила Мэгги.Кроша в суп большие кусочки хлеба, Буди добавила: Отца нашего, иже не на небеси.Наливая суп Кейти в тарелку, Мэгги воскликнула: Буди! Ну, как не стыдно!Кораблик, скомканный листок, Илия грядет, легко покачиваясь, плыл вниз по Лиффи, под Окружным мостом, проскакивая стремнины, там, где вода бурлила вокруг устоев, держа на восток, мимо судов и якорных цепей, между старым доком Таможни и набережной короля Георга.Блондинка у Торнтона устилала дно плетеной корзинки хрустящей гофрированной бумагой. Буян Бойлан передал ей бутылку, завернутую в розовую бумажную салфетку, и небольшой флакон. Первым делом вот это,  сказал он. Да, сэр,  ответила блондинка,  а фрукты сверху. Отлично, это будет победный мяч,  сказал Буян Бойлан.Красиво и бережно она уложила пузатые груши, попарно, хвостиками в разные стороны, и между ними спелые рдеющие стыдом персики.Буян Бойлан в новых рыжих штиблетах прохаживался по магазину, напитанному запахами плодов, трогал фрукты, сочные, молодые, морщинистые, и пухлые красные помидоры, подносил к носу, нюхал......, цепочка в белых цилиндрах, устало проследовали перед ним мимо Тэнджер-лейн, влачась к цели.Внезапно он отвернулся от короба с земляникой, вытащил из кармашка золотые часы и поглядел на них, отставив руку на всю длину цепочки. А вы их можете отправить трамваем? Прямо сейчас?Темноспинная фигура в пассаже Мерчентс-арч перебирала книги на лотке уличного торговца. Конечно, сэр. Это в городе? О да,  отвечал Буян Бойлан.  В десяти минутах езды.Блондинка подала карточку и карандаш. Вы не напишете адрес, сэр?Буян Бойлан за конторкой написал адрес и вернул ей карточку. Только пошлите сразу, договорились?  сказал он.  Это для больного. Да, сэр. Я сделаю, сэр.Буян Бойлан весело позвякал деньгами в кармане брюк. И на сколько вы меня разорили?  вопросил он.Тонкие пальчики блондинки пересчитали фрукты.Буян Бойлан заглянул ей за вырез блузки. Юная птичка. Он взял красную гвоздику из высокого бокала. Идет мне?  спросил он фатовато.Блондинка взглянула искоса на него, выпрямилась с независимым видом, на его галстук, слегка съехавший набок, зардевшись. Да, сэр,  сказала она.Наклонившись, она снова пересчитала пузатые груши и зардевшиеся персики.Буян Бойлан заглянул ей за блузку еще более благосклонно, зажав в смеющихся зубах стебель с красным цветком. Я скажу пару слов по вашему телефону, мисси?  спросил он развязно. Ма![] сказал Альмидано Артифони.Через плечо Стивена он рассеянно взирал на шишковатый череп Голдсмита[].Медленно проехали два вагона с туристами, женщины сидели впереди, ухватившись за поручни. Бледнолицые. Руки мужчин без стеснения обвивали их щуплые талии. Они смотрели со стороны Тринити на глухой, весь в колоннах, портал Ирландского банка, где гургургулили голуби.      ,  говорил Альмидано Артифони,   его   .          .  .         , . ,   [].

[],  отвечал Стивен, глядя вниз на обширную штанину. ,  , ?[] говорил Альмидано Артифони.Его тяжелая рука крепко сжала руку Стивена. Взгляд человека. Одно мгновение взгляд всматривался пытливо и тут же быстро перешел на подходивший трамвай из Долки. ,  торопливо и дружески сказал Альмидано Артифони.       . , []. , ,  отозвался Стивен, высвободившейся рукою приподымая шляпу.   [].  ?  спросил Альмидано Артифони.  , ?   ![]Альмидано Артифони, подняв как сигнал свернутые в трубку ноты, в своих обширных штанах устремился вслед за трамваем из Долки. Тщетно стремился он, подавая тщетно сигналы средь толчеи голоногих горцев, протаскивавших музыкальные принадлежности через ворота Тринити.Мисс Данн засунула подальше в стол Женщину в белом[], взятую из библиотеки на Кейпл-стрит, и заправила в свою машинку цветастый лист почтовой бумаги.Слишком тут много всего таинственного. Любит он эту Мэрион или нет?Лучше поменять да взять что-нибудь Мэри Сесил Хэй.Диск скользнул вниз по желобку, немного покачался, затих и показал им в окошечке: шесть.Мисс Данн отстучала по клавишам:  июня .Пять фигур в белых цилиндрах, с рекламными щитами, прозмеились между углом Монипени и постаментом, где не было статуи Вулфа Тона[], повернулись, показав ....., и проследовали назад, откуда пришли.Потом она уставилась на большую афишу с изображением Марии Кендалл[], очаровательной субретки, бездумно откинувшись и черкая в блокноте цифры шестнадцать и заглавные Эс. Горчичные волосы и размалеванные щеки. Что тут симпатичного? Юбчонка с ладонь, и ту еще задирает. Интересно, а он придет сегодня на музыку. Уговорить бы эту портниху, чтоб сделала плиссированную юбку как у Сьюзи Нэгл. Вид до того шикарный. Шаннон и все тузы из яхт-клуба от нее глаз не могли оторвать. Дай бог, повезет, он тут меня не продержит до семи.Телефон резко зазвонил у нее под ухом. Алло. Да, сэр. Нет, сэр. Да, сэр. Я позвоню им после пяти. Только эти два, сэр, в Белфаст и в Ливерпуль. Хорошо, сэр. Значит, я могу уходить после шести, если вы не вернетесь. В четверть седьмого. Да, сэр. Двадцать семь и шесть. Я скажу ему. Да: один фунт, семь и шесть.Она нацарапала на конверте три цифры. Мистер Бойлан! Минутку! Этот господин из Спорта заходил, искал вас.Да, мистер Ленехан. Он сказал, что будет в четыре в Ормонде. Нет, сэр.Да, сэр. Я позвоню им после пяти.Два розовых лица выступили в мерцании слабого огонька. Кто это?  спросил Нед Лэмберт.  Это Кротти, что ли? Рингабелла и Кроссхейвен[],  отозвался голос человека, нащупывающего ногой ступеньки. А, это вы, Джек, здравствуйте!  сказал Нед Лэмберт, приветственно поднимая гибкую рейку к мерцающим сводам.  Идите сюда. Учтите, что там ступеньки.Спичка в поднятой руке священника изошла длинным гибким язычком пламени и была брошена. Ее последняя искорка умерла у их ног  и затхлый воздух сомкнулся вокруг них. Как интересно!  произнес отточенный выговор во мраке. Да, сэр,  подхватил с живостью Нед Лэмберт.  Мы с вами стоим в той самой исторической палате аббатства святой Марии, где на совете шелковый Томас[] объявил о начале мятежа в  году. Это ведь самое историческое место во всем Дублине. ОМэдден Берк собирается вскорости о нем что-нибудь написать. До унии тут помещался старый Ирландский банк, и самый первый еврейский храм тоже тут был, пока они не построили свою синагогу на Аделаид-роуд. Джек, вы ведь тут раньше никогда не были? Нет, не случалось. Он въезжал через Дэйм-уок,  произнес отточенный выговор,  если мне память не изменяет. Замок Киллеров был в Томас-корт[]. Это верно,  сказал Нед Лэмберт.  Совершенно верно, сэр. Если вы будете столь добры,  произнес священник,  то, возможно, в следующий раз вы мне позволите Ну, конечно,  сказал Нед Лэмберт.  Приносите фотоаппарат, когда вам угодно. Я распоряжусь, чтобы эти мешки убрали бы с окон. Вы сможете снимать вот отсюда или отсюда.Он двигался в слабом мигающем свете, постукивая своей рейкой по грудам мешков с зерном и по удобным местам на полу.С вытянутого лица нависали над шахматной доской борода и пристальный взгляд. Я глубоко признателен, мистер Лэмберт,  сказал священник.  Не буду более занимать вашего драгоценного времени Всегда буду рад вам,  сказал Нед Лэмберт.  Заходите, когда угодно.Можно на следующей неделе. Вам видно? Да, да. Всего доброго, мистер Лэмберт. Было приятно познакомиться. Мне тоже очень приятно, сэр,  отвечал Нед Лэмберт.Он проводил гостя к выходу и на дворе зашвырнул свою рейку между колонн. Вместе с Дж.Дж.ОМоллоем они вышли неторопливо на аббатства Марии, где ломовики нагружали на фургоны мешки с альгарробой и с пальмовой мукой, ОКоннор, Вексфорд[].Он остановился прочесть визитную карточку, которую держал в руке. Преподобный Хью К.Лав, Рэткоффи. Адрес в настоящее время:Сент Майклс, Соллинс. Очень славный малый. Он мне сказал, он пишет книгу о Фицджеральдах[]. В истории отлично подкован, ей-богу.Девушка старательно принялась снимать с юбки приставший к ней стебелек. А я подумал, вы тут затеваете новый пороховой заговор,  сказал Дж.Дж.ОМоллой.Нед Лэмберт щелкнул пальцами в воздухе. Фу, черт!  воскликнул он.  Я же забыл ему рассказать про графа Килдерского, после того как тот поджег кафедральный собор в Кэшеле. Знаете эту историю? Чертовски сожалею, что я это сделал, так он сказал, но только готов поклясться, я думал, что архиепископ был там внутри . Хотя ему могло не понравиться. А? Нет, все равно расскажу ему. Это был великий граф, Фицджеральд Мор[]. Они все были горячие головы, эти Джералдайны.Лошади, мимо которых он проходил, беспокойно подергивались в распущенной упряжи. Он шлепнул по чалопегому крупу, что вздрагивал совсем рядом с ним, и прикрикнул: Н-но, балуй!Потом обернулся к Дж.Дж.ОМоллою и спросил: Ну, ладно, Джек. В чем дело? Что там стряслось? Ох, погодите минутку.Держитесь-ка.Откинув далеко голову и разинув рот, он на мгновение застыл неподвижно, после чего громко чихнул. Ап-чхи!  произнес он.  Черт побери! Это пыль от мешков,  вежливо заметил Дж.Дж.ОМоллой. Да нет,  выдохнул Нед Лэмберт,  это я подхватил холодная ночь поза вот дьявол ночь позавчера и такие гуляли сквознякиОн приготовил носовой платок для уже подступающего Я был утром бедный как его зовут Ап-чхи! Вот сатана!Том Рочфорд взял верхний диск из стопки, которую он прижимал к своему бордовому жилету. Видите?  спросил он.  Допустим, сейчас идет шестой номер. Кладу вот сюда, смотрите. Номер На Сцене.У них на глазах он опустил диск в левую щель. Диск скользнул вниз по желобку, слегка покачался и затих, показывая им в окошечке шесть.Юристы былых времен, важные и надменные, отправляя дела закона, взирали, как Ричи Гулдинг прошел из податного управления в гражданский суд с папкою фирмы Гулдинг, Коллис и Уорд, и слышали, как от адмиралтейского отделения королевского суда к суду апелляционному прошуршала пожилая особа женского пола с недоверчивою усмешкою, открывшей вставные зубы, в черной шелковой юбке, весьма пространной. Видите?  повторил он.  Смотрите, последний, что я опустил, теперь там сверху: Прошедшие Номера. Давление. Принцип рычага, понятно?Он показал им растущую стопку дисков на правой стороне. Ловко придумано,  сказал Флинн Длинный Нос, сопя.  Значит, кто опоздал, может видеть, какой сейчас номер и какие уже прошли. Видите?  повторил Том Рочфорд.Он опустил диск для собственного удовольствия  и наблюдал, как тот скользит вниз, качается, затихает и показывает: четыре. Номер На Сцене. Я его сейчас увижу в Ормонде,  сказал Ленехан,  и я его прощупаю.Чтоб путный номер даром не помер. Давай,  одобрил Том Рочфорд.  Скажи ему, я уж тут сам стал буян, так не терпится. Ну, я спать пошел,  сказал бесцеремонно Маккой.  Когда вы вдвоем заведетесьФлинн Длинный Нос склонился над рычагом, сопя. А как вот это действует, Томми?  спросил он. Труляля, голуби,  сказал Ленехан.  До скорой встречи.Он последовал за Маккоем на улицу через крохотный квадрат Крэмптон-корта. Он герой,  сказал он просто. Я знаю,  отозвался Маккой.  Это вы про канаву. Канаву?  сказал Ленехан.  Да это было в люке.Они миновали мюзик-холл Дэна Лаури, где на афише им улыбалась размалеванной улыбкой Мария Кендалл, очаровательная субретка.Идя вниз по тротуару Сайкмор-стрит мимо мюзик-холла Эмпайр, Ленехан представлял Маккою, как было дело. Один из этих чертовых люков прямо как газовая труба, и какой-то бедолага застрял там, причем наполовину уже задохся от канализационных газов. Ну, Том Рочфорд тут же лезет вниз, в чем был, при всем букмекерском параде, только обмотался канатом. И убей бог, он как-то ухитрился обмотать того бедолагу канатом, и обоих вытянули наружу. Геройский поступок,  заключил он.У Дельфина они остановились и пропустили карету скорой помощи, галопом промчавшуюся на Джервис-стрит. Вот сюда,  сказал он, сворачивая направо.  Заскочу к Лайнему поглядеть начальные ставки на Корону. Сколько там на ваших золотых с цепью?Маккой устремил взгляд в темную контору Маркуса Терциуса Мозеса, потом на часы ОНила. Начало четвертого,  сказал он.  А кто жокей? ОМэдден,  ответил Ленехан.  И у кобылки все шансы.Оставшийся на Темпл-бар Маккой легонько столкнул носком банановую кожуру с дороги в канаву. Кто-нибудь будет возвращаться в темноте под хмельком  не успеет оглянуться, сломает шею.Ворота в ограде резиденции распахнулись, открывая проезд кавалькаде вице-короля. Один к одному,  сказал Ленехан, вернувшись.  Я там натолкнулся на Бэнтама Лайонса, он ставил на какую-то пропащую клячу, кто-то ему подсказал, у которой ни малейшего шанса. Нам вот сюда.Они поднялись по ступеням и прошли через пассаж Мерчент-сарч.Темноспинная фигура перебирала книги на лотке уличного торговца. А вот и он,  заметил Ленехан. Интересно, что он покупает,  сказал Маккой, оглядываясь назад. "Леопольде, или История заблумшей души",  сказал Ленехан. Он просто помешан на распродажах,  сказал Маккой.  На днях мы шли с ним по Лиффи-стрит, и он купил книгу у какого-то старика за два шиллинга.Так в этой книге одни гравюры стоили вдвое, там звезды, луна, кометы с хвостами. Что-то насчет астрономии.Ленехан рассмеялся. Сейчас вот я вам одну историйку про хвосты комет,  посулил он.  Выйдемте-ка на солнышко.Они прошли по чугунному мосту и направились по набережной Веллингтона вдоль парапета.Юный Патрик Алоизиус Дигнам вышел из мясной лавки Мангана, бывшей Ференбаха, неся полтора фунта свиных котлет. Устраивали шикарный прием в Гленкри, в колонии для малолетних,  с живостью начал Ленехан.  Знаете, этот ежегодный банкет. По полной парадной форме. Присутствовали и лорд-мэр, тогда это был Вэл Диллон, и сэр Чарльз Камерон, Дэн Доусон говорил речь, а потом был концерт. Бартелл дАрси пел и Бен Доллард Я знаю,  прервал его Маккой.  Моя дражайшая пела там один раз. В самом деле?  сказал Ленехан.Табличка Сдаются квартиры без мебели снова появилась на оконной раме номера  по Экклс-стрит.Он замолк на мгновение, но тут же разразился отрывистым смехом. Да нет, дайте мне рассказать,  снова принялся он.  Делахант с Кэмден-стрит обеспечил весь стол, а ваш покорнейший был за главного виночерпия. Блум тоже там был со своей женой. Выпивки хоть залейся  портвейн, и херес, и кюрасо, и уж мы всему там воздали честь. Разгулялись на славу. От жидкостей  к твердым телам. Холодный филей навалом, паштеты Я знаю,  сказал Маккой.  В тот год, когда моя дражайшая там былаЛенехан с большим жаром обнял его под локоть. Да нет, дайте мне рассказать,  повторил он.  После всей этой увеселительности мы еще устроили легкий полночный завтрак, и когда мы отчалили, то уж было времени хренадцатый час того утра что после ночи.Домой возвращались в дивную зимнюю ночь через гору Фезербед. Блум и Крис Каллинан были на одной стороне кареты, а я с его женой  на другой. Мы там принялись распевать квартеты, дуэты: Взгляни, уж первый луч зари[]. А она изрядно нагрузилась тем делахантовым портвейном. И каждый раз, как эту чертову колымагу тряхнет, она валится прямо на меня. Недурная забава! У ней роскошная парочка, дай ей бог. Во-от такие.Округлив ладони, он отставил их на целый локоть перед собой, наморщил лоб: А я снизу все подтыкал под ней плед и без конца на ней поправлял боа.Улавливаете, о чем я?Руки его рисовали в воздухе полные округлости. От удовольствия он крепко зажмурился, всем телом подался вперед и нежно присвистнул. Одним словом, мальчик стоял навытяжку,  сказал он со вздохом.  А она кобылка норовистая, это точно. Блум между тем все показывал Крису Каллинану и кучеру разные звезды и кометы на небесах: вот тут большая медведица, и Геркулес, и дракон, и всякая прочая дребедень. Но я-то, можно сказать, совсем затерялся в млечном пути. Он знает их все наперечет, я клянусь. Наконец, она высмотрела где-то у черта на куличках самую махонькую-малюсенькую. И спрашивает: А вот это, Польди, какая звездочка ?Приперла Блума в угол, ничего не попишешь. Это вон та, что ли? говорит Крис Каллинан, да, это так себе, маленький тычок в черноте . Ну, тут уж он попал в точку.Ленехан остановился и прислонился к парапету, захлебываясь от тихого смеха. Ох, не могу,  задыхался он.Бледное лицо Маккоя, на миг улыбнувшись, приняло строгое выражение.Ленехан зашагал дальше. Он приподнял свою капитанку и быстрым движением почесал затылок. Под ярким солнцем он искоса бросил взгляд на Маккоя. Блум  человек знающий и культурный,  произнес он серьезно.  Это не какой-нибудь простофиля с улицы понимаете Наш старина Блум, в нем где-то чувствуется артист.Мистер Блум лениво переворачивал страницы Потрясающих разоблачений Марии Монк[], потом Шедевра Аристотеля. Нелепый шрифт, крючковатый.Цветные вклейки: младенцы клубком в кроваво-красных утробах, напоминают свежую бычью печень на бойне. Вот в эту самую минуту их множество таких во всем мире. И все тычутся головенками, хотят выйти оттуда. Каждую минуту рождается где-нибудь младенец. Миссис Пьюрфой.Он отложил обе книжки и глянул на третью: Истории из гетто, Леопольд фон Захер-Мазох. Эту я читал,  сказал он, отодвигая ее.Торговец шлепнул на прилавок два томика. Вот энти славная парочка,  посулил он.Через прилавок разило луком из его гнилозубого рта. Он наклонился, набрал стопку других книг, прижал их к своей расстегнутой жилетке и унес за грязную занавеску.На мосту ОКоннелла многочисленные лица могли наблюдать внушительную осанку и живописный наряд мистера Дэниса Дж.Маджинни, учителя танцев и пр.Мистер Блум, оставшись один, оглядел названия книг. Прекрасные мучительницы, Джеймс Лавберч. Розголюб. Понятно, какого это сорта. Была у меня? Да.Он раскрыл книгу. Кажется, та самая.Женский голос за грязной занавеской. Послушаем. Мужчина.Нет, ей такое не очень нравится. И уже приносил.Он прочитал другое название: Прелести греха. Пожалуй, более в ее вкусе. Давай посмотрим.Раскрыв наугад, он прочел: И все эти доллары, которыми осыпал ее муж, она тратила в магазинах на роскошные платья и самые разорительные безделушки. Ради него! Ради Рауля!Да. То что нужно. Еще посмотрим. Их губы слились в жадном и сладострастном поцелуе, а руки его ласкали ее пышные формы под легким дезабилье .Да. Это пойдет. А в конце. Вы запоздали,  произнес он хриплым голосом, бросая на нее злобный и подозрительный взгляд .Стройная красавица сбросила отороченное собольим мехом манто, явив взору свои роскошные плечи и пышно вздымающиеся округлости. Неуловимая улыбка тронула идеальные очертания ее губ, когда она спокойно повернулась к нему .Мистер Блум перечел еще раз: Стройная красавица Теплота мягко охватила его, расслабляя все тело. Тела в сбившихся одеждах податливо уступают; белки глаз наливаются. Его ноздри расширились, вынюхивая добычу. Испаренья умащенных грудей ( ради него! ради Рауля! ).Терпкий луковый пот подмышек. Склизкость рыбьего клея ( вздымающиеся округлости !). Ощутить! Сжать! Стиснуть, что только сил! Разящий серой львиный помет!Молодость! Молодость!Пожилая особа женского пола, уже давно не первой молодости, покинула здание суда лорда-канцлера и судов королевского, податного и гражданского, прослушав в первом дело о признании невменяемым Поттертона, во втором, в адмиралтейском отделении, в отсутствие одной из сторон  дело об иске владельцев Леди Кэрнс к владельцам барки Мона и в апелляционном суде  перенос слушания дела Харви против Морской страховой компании[].Клокочущий кашель сотряс воздух в книжной лавке, всколыхнув грязную занавеску. Высунулась седая нечесаная голова хозяина с небритым побагровевшим от кашля лицом. Он грубо прочистил горло и выблевал на пол сгусток. Потом наступил на свою харкотину сапогом, растер подошвой и наклонился, показывая голый череп с венчиком скудной растительности.Мистер Блум обозрел череп.Стараясь унять расходившееся дыхание, он сказал: Я возьму вот эту.Продавец поднял глаза, гноящиеся от хронического насморка. "Прелести греха",  произнес он, похлопывая по переплету.  Отличная книжка.Служитель в дверях аукционного зала Диллона опять потряс колокольчиком, дважды, и погляделся в исчерченное мелом зеркало туалетного столика.Дилли Дедал, стоя на тротуаре, слушала звонки колокольчика и возгласы аукционера, доносившиеся из зала. Четыре и девять. Вот чудные занавески.Пять шиллингов. Очень уютные занавески. Новые стоили бы две гинеи. Пять шиллингов, кто больше? Продано за пять шиллингов.Служитель поднял колокольчик и потряс им: Брень!Удар колокола, возвещающий о последнем круге, заставил рвануться гонщиков. В заезде на полмили[] Дж.Э.Джексон, У.Э.Уайли, Э.Монро и Х.Т.Гахан, поводя вытянутыми шеями, обрабатывали вираж возле Университетской библиотеки.Мистер Дедал, теребя длинный ус, появился со стороны Вильямс-роу. Он остановился возле своей дочери. Тебе уже пора,  сказала она. Держись прямо, ради любви Господа Иисуса!  воскликнул мистер Дедал. Или ты, может, изображаешь своего дядюшку Джона, трубача, голова в плечи? Тоскливый бог!Дилли пожала плечами. Мистер Дедал, положив свои ладони на них, отогнул их назад. Держись прямо, девочка,  повторил он,  ты заработаешь себе искривление позвоночника. Ты знаешь, какой у тебя вид?Он неожиданно уронил голову вниз и вперед, поднял плечи горбом и отвесил нижнюю челюсть. Перестань, отец,  сказала Дилли.  На тебя люди смотрят.Мистер Дедал выпрямился и вновь подергал свой ус. Ты достал денег?  спросила Дилли. Где это я достану?  отвечал мистер Дедал.  В Дублине ни одна душа не одолжит мне ни пенни. Нет, ты раздобыл что-то,  проговорила Дилли, глядя ему в глаза. А как это тебе известно?  спросил мистер Дедал, приняв таинственный вид.Мистер Кернан, довольный заключенною сделкой, шагал, гордо приосанившись, по Джеймс-стрит. Вот уж известно,  сказала Дилли.  Ты сейчас был в Скотч-хаусе[]? Нет, я там не был,  промолвил мистер Дедал с улыбкой.  А это тебя монашки так научили дерзить? Держи-ка.Он протянул ей шиллинг. Постарайтесь на это что-нибудь сделать,  сказал он. Я так думаю, ты достал пять,  ответила Дилли.  Дай мне сколько-нибудь побольше. Ну, погоди же,  угрожающе произнес мистер Дедал.  Ты что, тоже как все остальные, да? С тех пор как ваша бедная мать умерла, превратились в свору наглых щенков. Но погодите! Скоро увидите, у меня с вами будет разговор короткий. Разбой среди бела дня! Но я скоро от вас избавлюсь. Вам наплевать, если я лягу в гроб. Все, он умер. Жилец сверху умер[].Он отвернулся и зашагал прочь. Дилли тут же нагнала его и потянула за рукав. Ну что, в чем дело?  произнес он, останавливаясь.Служитель прозвонил в колокольчик у них за спиной. Брень! Язви твою окаянную душу!  воскликнул мистер Дедал, оборачиваясь к нему.Служитель, уловив замечание, снова потряс звучным язычком колокольчика, но потише: Тринь!Мистер Дедал пристально уставился на него. Полюбуйся-ка,  сказал он.  Это поучительно. Надеюсь, он нам милостиво позволит поговорить. Ты ведь достал больше, отец,  сказала Дилли. Я скоро с вами сыграю штуку,  посулил мистер Дедал.  Я с вами со всеми поступлю так, как Иисус с евреями[]. Смотри, вот все, что у меня есть.Я занял два шиллинга у Джека Пауэра и два пенса истратил, чтобы побриться перед похоронами.Он с раздражением вытащил пригоршню медяков. А ты не можешь еще где-нибудь поискать денег?  спросила Дилли.Мистер Дедал подумал и кивнул. Попробую,  сказал он с серьезным видом.  Я уже искал на ОКоннелл-стрит вдоль всей сточной канавы. А теперь попробую вдоль вот этой. Все остришь,  заметила Дилли с кривой усмешкой. Держи,  сказал мистер Дедал, протягивая ей два пенни.  Купи себе стакан молока и булочку или что-нибудь такое. Я скоро приду домой.Он сунул остальные монеты в карман и зашагал прочь.Кавалькада вице-короля показалась в воротах парка, подобострастно приветствуемая полисменами. Я точно знаю, у тебя есть еще шиллинг,  сказала Дилли.Служитель прозвонил громогласно.Мистер Дедал, сопровождаемый трезвоном, удалялся и бормотал себе под нос, жеманно складывая губы сердечком. Монашенки! Милые хрупкие создания! О, ну конечно, они ничего такого!О, ну конечно, они никогда бы не стали! Неужели это сестрица Моника!Довольный сделкой, которую он заключил для фирмы Пулбрук и Робертсон, мистер Кернан гордо вышагивал по Джеймс-стрит, направляясь от солнечных часов к Джеймс-гейт, мимо конторы Шеклтона. Отлично обработал его. Как поживаете, мистер Кримминс? Превосходно, сэр. Я опасался, что вы окажетесь в другом вашем заведении, в Пимлико. Как идут дела? Идут потихоньку.Чудесная погода стоит. Да, чудесная. Для полевых работ это хорошо. А то фермеры вечно ворчат. Пожалуй, я бы выпил глоток вашего отменного джина, мистер Кримминс. Малую порцию джина, сэр. Да, сэр. Что за ужасное происшествие этот взрыв на Генерале Слокаме[]. Ужасно, ужасно! Около тысячи жертв. И душераздирающие сцены. Мужчины, топчущие ногами детей и женщин. Самая настоящая дикость. А что они говорят, какая причина?Внезапное возгорание. Выяснились скандальнейшие обстоятельства. Не было ни одной спасательной шлюпки исправной, и все пожарные шланги оказались дырявыми. Но я одного не пойму, как могла инспекция выпустить такой пароход Ага, вот сейчас вы в самую точку, мистер Кримминс. Знаете почему? Подмазали кого надо. Неужели это правда? Никакого сомнения. Вы только подумайте. И еще говорят, что Америка  это страна свободных людей.Я привык думать, у нас тут плохо.Я улыбнулся ему. Америка , заявил я ему так спокойненько, что это по сути такое? Мусор, выметенный из всех стран, включая и нашу. А что, разве это не верно? Истинный факт.Коррупция, дорогой сэр. Да, еще бы, везде, где пахнет деньгами, найдутся охотники до поживы.Заметил, как он смотрел на мой редингот. Костюм  первейшее дело[]. Самое главное иметь элегантный вид. Действует безотказно. Ба, Саймон!  сказал отец Каули.  Как делишки? Вижу старину Боба,  произнес, останавливаясь, мистер Дедал.Мистер Кернан, задержав шаги у парикмахерской Питера Кеннеди, с большим одобрением оглядел себя в наклонном зеркале. Что говорить, щегольской сюртук. От Скотта с Доусон-стрит. Вполне стоит полсоверена, что я за него отдал Нири. Сшить такой новый не меньше чем три гинеи. А как отлично сидит. Небось от какого-нибудь денди из клуба на Килдер-стрит. Вчера Джон Маллиган, управляющий Гибернийским банком, так на меня уставился, на мосту Карлайл, как будто хотел припомнить.Хо хо! С этими господами нужно держать марку. Коммивояжер-джентльмен.Рыцарь больших дорог[]. Так как, мистер Кримминс, не окажете ли вы нам снова честь вашим заказом, сэр. Чаша, что веселит, но не опьяняет, как говорится в старой пословице.Мимо Северной стены и набережной сэра Джона Роджерсона, мимо судов и якорных цепей, плывя на запад, проплывал кораблик, скомканный листок, покачиваясь на волне от парома. Илия грядет.Мистер Кернан бросил прощальный взгляд на свое отражение. В лице багрянец, да. Седеющие усы. Вернувшийся из Индии офицер. Браво расправив плечи, он двинулся вперед, обутые в гетры ноги легко несли коренастый торс. Это там не брат Лэмберта, Сэм? А? Никак, он. Просто чертовски похож.Нет. Ветровое стекло автомобиля блеснуло на солнце. Из-за вспышки. Но чертовски похож.Хо хо! Жаркие пары можжевелового сока согревали его дыхание и внутренности. Славно пропустил рюмочку джина. Фалды его редингота подмигивали под ярким солнцем в такт его грузной походке.Вон там Эммет был повешен и четвертован[]. Черная засаленная веревка.Собаки еще слизывали кровь с улицы, когда жена лорда-наместника проезжала там в своем экипаже.Минутку. А похоронили его где, у святого Мичена? Хотя нет, ведь было в Гласневине погребение, в полночь. Внесли тело через потайную дверь в стене. Теперь и Дигнам там. Помер, не успели оглянуться. Что поделаешь.Лучше здесь повернуть. Обогну.Мистер Кернан повернул и начал спускаться по наклонной Уотлинг-стрит, где на углу был зал ожидания для посетителей Гиннесса. У складов Дублинской винокуренной компании стояли дрожки без седока и без кучера, вожжи привязаны к колесу. Это же чертовски опасно. Какая-нибудь деревенская дубина из Типперери подвергает опасности жизни граждан. Стоит лошади понести.Дэнис Брин со своими фолиантами, устав ждать больше часу в конторе Джона Генри Ментона, увлекал свою жену через мост ОКоннелла, направляясь в контору Коллиса и Уорда.Мистер Кернан подошел к Айленд-стрит.Времена смуты[]. Надо бы попросить у Неда Лэмберта воспоминания сэра Ионы Баррингтона[]. Когда смотришь на всю эту старину сейчас, с неким ретроспективным упорядочением. Картеж у Дэли.

Конечно, они боролись за неправое дело. Им выпал злой и смутный век[]. Прекрасное стихотворение Инграма. Они были настоящие люди чести. Бен Доллард с таким чувством поет эту балладу. Мастерское исполнение.При осаде Росса отец погиб[].По набережной Пембрук проследовал кортеж мелкой рысью, форейторы мерно подскакивали  скок-скок  на седлах, на седлах. Рединготы. Кремовые зонтики.Мистер Кернан заторопился, тяжело отдуваясь.Его Сиятельство! Вот ведь не повезло! Какой-то секундой опоздал! Вот черт! Такая жалость!Стивен Дедал наблюдал сквозь подернутое паутиной окно, как пальцы ювелира ощупывали потускневшую от времени цепочку. Пыль подернула паутиной окно и полки витрины. От пыли потемнели усердные пальцы с ястребиными когтями. Пыль дремала на тусклых завитках бронзы и серебра, на ромбиках киновари, на рубинах, изъеденных проказой винно-темных камнях.Все это рождено во мгле червивой земли, холодные искорки, огоньки зла, светящие во тьме. Где падшие архангелы срывали звезды со своего чела[].Грязные свиные рыла, руки, роют и роют, хватают и тащат их.Она пляшет в зловонном сумраке, где смешан дух чеснока и горящей смолы.Ржавобородый матрос, прихлебывая ром из кувшинчика, глядит на нее во все глаза. Долгая, вскормленная морем немая похоть. Она пляшет, кружится, трясет своими окороками, на толстом брюхе подпрыгивает рубин размером с яйцо.Старый Рассел еще потер камень старым куском замши, повернул его и поднес к концу своей Моисеевой бороды. Дедушка орангутанг любуется украденным сокровищем.А ты разве не откапываешь старые образы из могильной земли? Бредовые словеса софистов: Антисфен. Искусство усыплять ум.

Существа без сущности. Постой! А вечное биенье в тебе, помимо тебя[]. Все распеваешь о своем сердце. Я между ними. Где это?

Сводник и мясник, так я сказал. Еще бы! Но погоди малость. Оглядись.Да, совершенно верно. Большие, замечательные, прославленной точности[].Совершенная правда, сэр. В понедельник утром, как вы сказали[].Стивен спускался по Бедфорд-роу, ясеневой рукояткой трости постукивая себя по лопатке. В витрине у Клохисси взгляд его привлекла выцветшая гравюра  года, изображающая боксерский матч между Хиненом и Сейерсом.За канатами глазели на ринг сделавшие ставки зрители в допотопных шляпах.Тяжеловесы в тесных набедренниках любезно протягивали друг другу шарообразные кулаки. Они тоже бьются  сердца героев.Он повернул за угол и остановился возле накренившегося лотка с книгами. Каждая по два пенса,  сказал торговец.  На шесть пенсов четыре.Потрепанные страницы. Ирландский пчеловод. Жизнь и чудеса кюре из Арса[]. Карманный путеводитель по Килларни.Тут бы могли валяться и мои школьные награды, которые снесли в заклад. ,  ,  [].Отец Конми, закончив читать малые часы, шел через деревушку Донникарни, шепча вечерние молитвы.Слишком хорош переплет, что бы это такое? Восьмая и девятая книги Моисеевы[]. Тайна всех тайн. Печать царя Давида. Захватанные страницы:читали и перечитывали. Кто здесь проходил до меня? Как размягчить потрескавшуюся кожу на руках. Рецепт для приготовления уксуса из белого вина. Как добиться любви женщины. Вот это для меня. Сложив руки, произнести трижды следующее заклинание:     !   ! ! [].Кто это написал? Заговоры и заклинания блаженнейшего аббата Питера Саланки, обнародованные для всех истинно верующих. Не хуже, чем заговоры любого другого аббата, чем бормотанье Иоахима. Спустись, плешивец, не то мы будем прясть твою шерсть. Ты что тут делаешь, Стивен?Дилли, высокие плечики и заношенное платьице.Закрой ка живее книгу. Чтоб не увидела. А ты что делаешь?  сказал Стивен.Лицо Стюарта, бесподобного Чарльза, обрамленное гладкими прядями[].Горевшее румянцем, когда, сидя у огня, она в него подбрасывала старые башмаки. Я ей рассказывал о Париже. Любила подольше поваляться в постели, укрывшись старым тряпьем, без конца теребя свой браслетик под золото, подарок Дэна Келли.  . Что это у тебя?  спросил Стивен. На другом лотке купила за пенни,  сказала Дилли с нервным смешком.  Она годится на что-нибудь?Говорят у нее мои глаза. Таким вот и видит меня взор прочих? Живым, смелым и отчужденным. Тень моего ума.Он взял у нее из рук книгу с оторванной обложкой. Шарденаль, французский язык для начинающих. Зачем ты это купила?  спросил он.  Учиться по-французски?Она кивнула, покраснев и сжав плотно губы.Не показывай удивления. Вполне естественно. Держи,  сказал Стивен.  Годится, почему ж нет. Смотри, чтобы Мэгги ее не унесла у тебя в заклад. Я так думаю, мои книги туда все ушли. Часть из них,  ответила Дилли.  Нам пришлось.Ведь она тонет. Жагала. Спасти ее. Жагала. Все против нас. Она утопит и меня с собой, глаза и волосы. Гладкие кольца волос-водорослей обвивают меня, мое сердце, душу. Горькая зеленая смерть.Мы.Жагала сраму. Сраму жагала.Нищета! Нищета! Ба, Саймон!  сказал отец Каули.  Как делишки? Вижу старину Боба,  произнес, останавливаясь, мистер Дедал.Они обменялись звучным рукопожатием возле магазина Редди и Дочь. Отец Каули, сложив ладонь лодочкой, мелкими движениями пригладил усы[]. Ну, что хорошенького?  спросил мистер Дедал. Да небогато,  отвечал отец Каули.  В дом свой, Саймон, не попаду, два субъекта у входа караулят, чтоб было право войти. Как мило,  отозвался мистер Дедал.  А кто это постарался? Да так,  сказал отец Каули.  Некий процентщик из числа наших знакомых. Тот, что спина крюком?  спросил мистер Дедал. Он самый, Саймон,  отвечал отец Каули.  Рувим из колена Рувимова. Я тут как раз поджидаю Бена Долларда. Он должен пойти к Длинному Джону да замолвить за меня словечко, чтобы он убрал этих двух. Мне бы только дали немного времени.В смутной надежде он кинул взгляд туда и сюда по набережной. Его крупный кадык заметно выдавался на шее. Знаю, знаю,  сказал, кивая, мистер Дедал.  Старый сердяга Бен!Вечно старается для кого-нибудь. Погодите-ка!Он нацепил пенсне и на секунду всмотрелся в направлении чугунного моста. Подходит!  возвестил он.  Явился собственнозадно, прости Господи.Старомодная шляпа и просторная синяя визитка Бена Долларда над мешковатыми брюками на всех парах двигались через набережную от чугунного моста. Он приближался к ним рысцой, рьяно почесывая у себя под фалдами.Мистер Дедал приветствовал его появление: Держите-ка мне вот этого в дурацких штанах. Ну-ну, давайте,  отозвался Бен Доллард.Мистер Дедал с холодным презрением оглядел Бена Долларда с головы до ног. Затем, кивая на него отцу Каули, он язвительно процедил: Какой удачный наряд для летнего дня, не правда ли? Что-что?  прорычал свирепо Бен Доллард.  Да разрази вас гром, я на своем веку столько сносил костюмов, сколько вам и во сне не снилось.Стоя рядом, он лучезарно улыбался им и своему пространному одеянию, с которого мистер Дедал сбивал там и сям пушинки, приговаривая: Нет, что ни говори, Бен, это сшито на мужчину в расцвете сил. Да провалиться тому еврею, который сшил это,  отозвался Бен Доллард. Слава богу, ему еще не заплачено. А как поживает ваш  , Бенджамин?  спросил отец Каули.Кэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл, омоноклив глаз, что-то невнятно бормоча, прошагал мимо клуба на Килдер-стрит.Бен Доллард нахмурил брови и, сделав вдруг рот как у певца, издал низкую ноту. О-о!  прогудел он. Вот это класс!  заметил мистер Дедал, одобрительно кивнув. Ну, как?  вопросил Бен Доллард.  Не заржавел пока? А?Он обернулся поочередно к обоим. Подходяще,  сказал отец Каули и тоже кивнул.Преподобный Хью К.Лав шел от бывшего здания капитула аббатства святой Марии, мимо спиртоочистительного завода Джеймса и Чарльза Кеннеди, в сторону Фолсела[], что за скотопрогонным бродом, и воображению его рисовались целые сонмы Джералдайнов, один другого осанистей и отважней.Бен Доллард, грузно кренясь в сторону магазинных витрин, увлекал их вперед, весело жестикулируя пальцами. Пойдемте-ка вместе со мной в полицию,  говорил он.  Я вам хочу показать, какого красавчика Рок недавно зачислил в приставы. Нечто среднее между вождем зулусов и Джеком Потрошителем. Стоит взглянуть, уверяю вас.Пойдемте. Я только что встретил случайно Джона Генри Ментона в Бодеге[], и это мне дорого обойдется, если я не Погодите малость Наше дело верное, Боб, можете мне поверить. Вы ему скажите, мне бы несколько дней,  сказал отец Каули с тоскливой тревогой.Бен Доллард резко остановился и уставился на него, разинув свой звучный зев. Оторванная пуговица визитки, ярко поблескивая, закачалась на своей ниточке, когда он принялся вытирать слезящиеся глаза, чтобы лучше слышать. Какие еще несколько дней?  прогремел он.  Ваш домохозяин разве не подал ко взысканию? Подал,  сказал отец Каули. Ну, а тогда исполнительный лист нашего друга не стоит и той бумаги, на которой написан,  заявил Бен Доллард.  Право первого иска всегда за домохозяином. Я ему сообщил все сведения. Виндзор-авеню, . Его фамилия Лав? Да, да,  сказал отец Каули.  Его преподобие мистер Лав. Он, кажется, священник где-то в провинции. Но вы точно уверены? Можете от меня передать Варавве,  сказал Бен Доллард,  чтобы он сунул этот лист туда, где мартышки прячут орехи.Он решительно увлекал за собой отца Каули, прикованного к его туше. Я думаю, не грецкие, а лесные,  пробормотал мистер Дедал, следуя за ними и опуская пенсне на лацканы своего сюртука. Насчет мальчика все в порядке,  сказал Мартин Каннингем, когда они проходили мимо ворот Касл-ярда.Полисмен дотронулся до фуражки. Дай вам Бог,  ободряюще произнес Мартин Каннингем.Он сделал знак поджидавшему кучеру, тот дернул вожжи и тронулся в сторону Лорд-Эдвард-стрит.За бронзой золото, за головкой мисс Кеннеди головка мисс Дус, появились над занавеской отеля Ормонд. Да-да,  сказал Мартин Каннингем, потрагивая бороду.  Я написал отцу Конми и все изложил ему. Вы бы могли попытаться и у нашего друга,  предложил задним числом мистер Пауэр. У Бойда? Благодарю покорно,  отрезал коротко Мартин Каннингем.Джон Уайз Нолан, отставший за чтением списка, быстро пустился их нагонять по Корк-хилл.На ступенях ратуши советник Наннетти, спускаясь, приветствовал поднимающихся олдермена Каули и советника Абрахама Лайона.Муниципальный фургон, пустой, завернул на Верхнюю Эксчейндж-стрит. Взгляните-ка, Мартин,  сказал Джон Уайз Нолан, догнав их возле редакции Мейл.  Я тут вижу, что Блум подписался на пять шиллингов. Совершенно верно,  сказал Мартин Каннингем, забирая у него лист.  Мало того, он их немедленно внес. Без громких речей,  заметил мистер Пауэр. Довольно странно, но факт,  добавил Мартин Каннингем.Джон Уайз Нолан удивленно раскрыл глаза. Как много у еврея доброты, замечу я[],  щегольнул он цитатой.Они направились по Парламент-стрит. А вот и Джимми Генри,  сказал мистер Пауэр,  как раз поспешает к Каване. Раз так,  сказал Мартин Каннингем,  то и мы за ним.Возле    Буян Бойлан изловил горбатого зятя Джека Муни[], бывшего в подпитии и направлявшегося в слободку.Джон Уайз Нолан с мистером Пауэром шли теперь позади, а Мартин Каннингем взял под руку маленького аккуратного человечка в сером с искрой костюме, который нетвердой торопливой походкой проходил мимо часового магазина Микки Андерсона. Видно, у младшего муниципального секретаря мозоли дают себя знать,  заметил Джон Уайз Нолан мистеру Пауэру.Они обогнули угол, следуя к винному погребу Джеймса Каваны. Пустой муниципальный фургон, стоявший у Эссекс-гейт, оказался перед самым носом у них. Мартин Каннингем все продолжал говорить, то и дело показывая Джимми Генри подписной лист, на который тот ни разу не глянул. И Длинный Джон Феннинг тоже здесь,  сказал Джон Уайз Нолан,  во всю натуральную величину.Высокая фигура Длинного Джона Феннинга заполняла собой всю дверь. Добрый день, господин главный инспектор,  произнес Мартин Каннингем, и все остановились для обмена приветствиями.Длинный Джон феннинг не освободил им проход. Резким движением он вынул изо рта большую сигару, и его круглые глаза пронзительно окинули их умным и хищным взглядом. Сенаторы Рима продолжают предаваться мирной беседе?  проговорил он звучно и насмешливо, обращаясь к младшему муниципальному секретарю.Устроили там адские баталии, заговорил с раздражением Джимми Генри, вокруг своего треклятого ирландского языка. Он бы хотел знать, чем занимается распорядитель, когда надо поддерживать порядок в зале заседаний. А старый Барлоу, хранитель жезла, слег из-за своей астмы, жезла на столе нет, сплошной кавардак, нет даже кворума, и сам лорд-мэр Хатчинсон в Лландудно, а маленький Лоркан Шерлок изображает его  []. Пропади он пропадом, этот язык наших предков.Длинный Джон Феннинг выпустил изо рта струю дыма.Мартин Каннингем, покручивая кончик бороды, снова принялся говорить, обращаясь то к главному инспектору, то к младшему муниципальному секретарю, а Джон Уайз Нолан мирно помалкивал. А какой это Дигнам?  спросил Длинный Джон феннинг.Джимми Генри сделал гримасу и потряс в воздухе левой ногой. Ох, мои мозоли!  жалобно простонал он.  Пойдемте, бога ради, наверх, чтобы я мог хоть присесть! У-у! Ох-хо-хо! Позвольте!В сердцах он протиснулся сбоку от Длинного Джона Феннинга и поднялся по лестнице. Да, пойдемте наверх,  сказал Мартин Каннингем главному инспектору.  Мне кажется, что вы не знали его, хотя, конечно, возможно.Мистер Пауэр и Джон Уайз Нолан последовали за ними. Он был скромный и честный малый,  поведал Джек Пауэр дюжей спине Длинного Джона Феннинга, которая поднималась навстречу Длинному Джону Феннингу в зеркале. Небольшой такой. Дигнам из конторы Ментона,  дополнил Мартин Каннингем.Длинный Джон Феннинг не мог припомнить его.В воздухе пронеслось цоканье лошадиных копыт. Что это?  спросил Мартин Каннингем.Все обернулись, где кто стоял. Джон Уайз Нолан снова спустился вниз.Стоя в прохладной тени прохода, он видел, как кони двигались по Парламент-стрит, сбруя и лоснящиеся бабки поблескивали на солнце. Весело, не спеша, они проследовали мимо под его холодным недружелюбным взглядом.Впереди скакали, впереди на седлах мерно подскакивали форейторы. Так что это там?  спросил Мартин Каннингем, когда они снова начали подниматься. Лорд-наместник и генерал-губернатор Ирландии,  отвечал Джон Уайз Нолан с нижней ступеньки.Когда они шли по толстому ковру, Бык Маллиган, прикрывшись своей панамой, шепнул Хейнсу: Брат Парнелла. Вон в том углу.Они выбрали маленький столик у окна, напротив человека с вытянутым лицом, борода и пристальный взгляд которого нависали над шахматной доской. Вот это он?  спросил Хейнс, поворачиваясь на своем сиденье. Да,  ответил Маллиган.  Это Джон Хауард, его брат, наш городской церемониймейстер.Джон Хауард Парнелл спокойно передвинул белого слона и снова поднес грязноватый коготь ко лбу, где он и остался неподвижно.Через мгновение из-под его заслона глаза его бросили на противника быстрый, неуловимо сверкнувший взгляд и вновь устремились на критический участок доски. Мне кофе по-венски,  сказал Хейнс официантке. Два кофе по-венски,  сказал Маллиган.  И еще принесите нам масло, булочки и каких-нибудь пирожных.Когда она удалилась, он со смехом сказал: Мы тут говорим, что ДХК значит дрянной холодный кофе. Да, но вы упустили Дедаловы речи о Гамлете.Хейнс раскрыл свою свежеприобретенную книгу. Мне очень жаль,  сказал он.  Шекспир  это благодатная почва для тех умов, что утратили равновесие.Одноногий матрос, приблизившись к Нельсон-стрит, , рявкнул: Англия ждет Лимонный жилет Быка Маллигана весело всколыхнулся от смеха. Вам стоит на него посмотреть,  сказал он,  когда его тело утрачивает равновесие. Я его называю Энгус-Скиталец. Я уверен, у него есть какая-то  ,  сказал Хейнс, задумчиво пощипывая подбородок большим и указательным пальцами.  И я раздумываю, в чем бы она могла быть. У таких людей она всегда есть.Бык Маллиган с серьезным выражением наклонился к нему через стол. Ему свихнули мозги,  заявил он,  картинами адских мук[]. И теперь ему уж никогда не достичь эллинской ноты. Той ноты, что, из всех наших поэтов, была у одного Суинберна, и смерти белизна и алое рожденье едино суть[].Вот в чем его трагедия. Ему никогда не стать поэтом. Радость творчества Вечные мучения,  произнес Хейнс, учтиво кивая,  да, я понимаю.Сегодня утром я его слегка попытал на тему о вере. Я видел, у него засело что-то в уме. Все это довольно любопытно, потому что в Вене профессор Покорный из этого делает любопытные выводы[].Бык Маллиган, заметив бдительным оком приближение официантки, помог ей освободить поднос. В древнеирландском мифе ему не найти даже намека на ад,  промолвил Хейнс, оказавшись между бодрящих чаш.  Похоже, что там нет и нравственной идеи, нет чувства судьбы, возмездия. Довольно странно, что у него именно такая  . Он как-нибудь участвует в вашем литературном движении?Ловким жестом он запустил сбоку в чашку два куска сахара сквозь слой взбитых сливок. Бык Маллиган разрезал еще горячую булочку и намазал маслом дышащую парком мякоть. С большим аппетитом он основательно откусил от нее. Десять лет,  со смехом проговорил он, жуя.  Вот через столько он что-нибудь напишет. Довольно изрядный срок,  сказал Хейнс, задумчиво подняв ложечку.  И все же я не удивлюсь, если ему удастся, в конце концов.Он снял и отведал ложечку с макушки белокремовой шапки на своей чашке. Надеюсь, что это настоящие ирландские сливки,  снисходительно произнес он.  Я не люблю быть объектом надувательства.Легкий кораблик, скомканный бумажный листок, Илия, плыл рядом с бортами больших и малых судов, посреди архипелага пробок, минуя Нью-Воппинг-стрит, на восток, мимо парома Бенсона и рядом с трехмачтовой шхуной Роузвин, шедшей из Бриджуотера с грузом кирпичей.Альмидано Артифони миновал Холлс-стрит, потом двор Сьюэлла. Позади него Кэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл, с болтающейся на руке плащезонтростью, далеко обошел фонарный столб перед домом мистера Лоу Смита и, перейдя улицу, зашагал по Меррион-Сквер. Поодаль, позади него, слепой юноша выстукивал свой путь вдоль ограды университетского парка.Кэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл дошел до приветливых витрин мистера Льюиса Вернера, затем повернул и пошел обратно по Меррион-сквер, с болтающеюся на руке плащезонтростью.На углу дома Уайльда[] он задержался, насупился на имя Илии, возвещаемое на стене Метрополитен-холла, затем на дальний газон герцогской усадьбы.Его монокль насупленно блеснул на солнце. Оскалив крысиные зубы, он пробормотал:  [].И зашагал дальше, в сторону Клэр-стрит, пережевывая свои смелые слова.Когда он вышагивал мимо окон мистера Блума, дантиста, его плащ, болтаясь, резко сбил в сторону тоненькую постукивавшую тросточку и повлекся дальше, хлестнув по хилому телу. Слепой юноша повернул вслед прохожему свое болезненное лицо. Будь ты проклят, кто ты там есть!  воскликнул он с озлоблением.  Не я слепой, а ты, чертов ублюдок!Напротив бара Рогги ОДоноху юный Патрик Алоизиус Дигнам, прижимая к себе полтора фунта свиных котлет, за которыми его посылали в мясную лавку Мангана, бывшую Ференбаха, глазея по сторонам и наслаждаясь теплом, шагал по Уиклоу-стрит. Скука была до чертиков сидеть там в зале вместе с миссис Стор и миссис Квигли и миссис Макдауэлл, занавески задернуты, а они все всхлипывают, сморкаются и потягивают первосортный херес, что дядя Барни принес от Танни. Доедают остатки фруктового пирога, сидят до чертиков, да одно и то же толкут. И вздыхают.За Уиклоу-лейн его заинтересовала витрина мадам Дойл, придворной портнихи. Он остановился, глядя на двух противников, голых до пояса, изготовившихся боксировать. Из боковых зеркал молча глазели два юных Дигнама в трауре. Майлер Кео, любимчик Дублина, встретится с сержантом Беннетом, портобелльским тузилой, приз пятьдесят соверенов, ух ты, вот это будет матч, посмотреть бы[]. Майлер Кео, это который атакует того, с зеленым поясом. За вход два шиллинга, с солдат половина. Мамку-то я запросто обхитрю. Левый Дигнам повернулся, когда он повернулся. А, это же я в трауре. Когда будет? Двадцать второго мая. Эх, жалко до чертиков, опоздал.Он повернулся тоже, шапка у него съехала набок, воротничок вылез. Задрав подбородок, чтобы его застегнуть, он увидел невдалеке от боксеров изображение Марии Кендалл, очаровательной субретки. Картинки с такими девками бывают в пачках от сигарет. Стор за окурками охотится, а его однажды родитель застукал как он курил и задал просто страшенную трепку.Юный Дигнам заправил свой воротничок и двинулся дальше. По силе удара самый первый из боксеров это Фицсиммонс[]. Такой даст разочек в поддых, и ты очухаешься через неделю, дружок. Но самый первый по технике, это был Джем Корбетт, до тех пор, пока Фицсиммонс не вышиб из него все его хитрости, и все потроха в придачу.На Грэфтон-стрит юный Дигнам увидал шикарного франта, у которого был во рту красный цветок, а на ногах ботинки  картинки, и ему какой-то пьяный все чего-то толкует, а он только ухмыляется.Трамвая на Сэндимаунт все не было.Юный Дигнам пошел по Нассау-стрит, переложив свиные котлеты в другую руку. Воротничок у него опять отстегнулся, и он запихнул его обратно.Уродская запонка, не подходит для этой дырки, надоела до чертиков. Ему повстречались школьники с ранцами. Завтра опять не пойду, останусь до понедельника. Навстречу еще шли школьники. Интересно, они заметили, что я в трауре? Дядя Барни сказал, он даст сегодня об этом в газету. Тогда все в газете увидят и прочитают мое имя напечатанным и папино имя.Лицо у него вместо красного, как всегда было, сделалось совсем серое, и муха ползла по нему вверх, к глазам. Так скрипело, когда ввинчивали винты в гроб, и так глухо стукалось, когда несли вниз.Папа был там внутри, а мама плакала в зале, а дядя Барни показывал, как пронести на повороте. Гроб был такой большой, высокий, тяжелый с виду. Как все это было? В последний вечер, когда папа напился, он стоял на лестничной площадке и орал, чтоб ему дали башмаки, он пойдет к Танни и там еще напьется, и он казался таким толстым и низеньким в рубашке. Больше никогда его не увижу. Это называется смерть. Папа умер. Мой отец умер. Он мне сказал, чтобы я был маме хорошим сыном. Я не мог разобрать, что он еще говорил, но я видел, как его язык и зубы что-то старались выговорить.Бедный папа. Это был мистер Дигнам, мой отец. Я надеюсь, что он сейчас в чистилище, потому что он ходил к отцу Конрою на исповедь в субботу вечером.Вильям Хамбл, граф Дадли[], и леди Дадли в сопровождении подполковника Хесселтайна после завтрака выехали из резиденции вице-короля. В следующей карете находились почтенная миссис Пэджет, мисс де Курси и почтенный Джеральд Уорд, дежурный адъютант.Кортеж проследовал через нижние ворота Феникс-парка, приветствуемый подобострастными полисменами, и мимо Королевского моста направился по северным набережным. На всем пути следования по столичным улицам вице-король встречал знаки самых наисердечнейших чувств. У Кровавого моста[] мистер Томас Кернан, находившийся по ту сторону реки, тщетно посылал свои приветствия издали. Вице-королевские кареты лорда Дадли проследовали между мостом Королевы и мостом Уитворта, где не получили приветствия от мистера Дадли Уайта, бакалавра права и магистра искусств, стоявшего на Арран-куэй рядом с домом ростовщицы миссис М.И.Уайт, что на углу Арран-стрит, и потиравшего нос в раздумье, попадет ли он в Фибсборо быстрей трамваем с тремя пересадками, или на извозчике, или же пешком через Смитфилд, холм Конституции и вокзал Бродстоун. В портике Судебной палаты Ричи Гулдинг, с фирменным портфелем Гулдинга, Коллиса и Уорда, воззрился на него с удивлением. За мостом Ричмонд, в подъезде конторы Рувима Дж.Додда, присяжного поверенного, агента Патриотической страховой компании, пожилая особа женского пола, собравшаяся было войти, передумала и, следуя назад по своим стопам, возле окон конторы Кинга обратила доверчивую улыбку к наместнику Его Величества. Из своего стока в стене Вуд-куэй, расположенного прямо под конторой Тома Девана[], речушка Поддл представила верноподданные излияния своей вонючей струи. За бронзой золото, за головкой мисс Кеннеди головка мисс Дус, поверх занавески отеля Ормонд, наблюдали с восхищением. На Ормонд-куэй мистер Саймон Дедал, направляясь из уличного сортира в полицейское управление, застыл неподвижно посреди улицы, низко опустив шляпу. Его Сиятельство с изяществом ответно приветствовал мистера Дедала. На углу типографии Кахилла преподобный Хью К.Лав, магистр искусств, погруженный в размышления о знатных сеньорах, которые в давние времена раздавали щедрой рукой завидные церковные привилегии, отвесил поклон, оставшийся незамеченным. На мосту Граттана Ленехан и Маккой, собравшись прощаться друг с другом, смотрели на проезжающие кареты. Проходя мимо конторы Роджера Грина и большого красного дома типографии Долларда, Герти Макдауэлл[], которая несла своему больному отцу письма и образцы линолеума Кэтсби, догадалась по виду карет, что это были лорд-наместник с супругой, но так и не смогла разглядеть, в каком туалете была Ее Сиятельство, потому что трамвай и большой желтый мебельный фургон Спринга остановились как раз перед ней, именно из-за проезда лорда-наместника. За домом фирмы Ланди и Футс, Джон Уайз Нолан, стоя в темных дверях винного погреба Каваны, послал холодную незамеченную усмешку лорду-наместнику и генерал-губернатору Ирландии. Достопочтенный Вильям Хамбл, граф Дадли, кавалер Большого Креста ордена Виктории, миновал неумолчно тикающие часы Микки Андерсона и восковые манекены Генри и Джеймса, румянощекие, в элегантных костюмах, джентльмен Генри,  []. Джеймс. Стоя спиной к Дэйм-гейт, Том Рочфорд и Флинн Длинный Нос наблюдали приближение кортежа. Том Рочфорд, увидев, что взгляд леди Дадли остановился на нем, поспешно вытащил большие пальцы из кармашков бордового жилета и снял с головы фуражку. Очаровательная субретка, великая Мария Кендалл, с размалеванными щеками и приподнятой юбочкой, посылала со своей афиши размалеванную улыбку Вильяму Хамблу, графу Дадли, а также полковнику Х.Дж.Хесселтайну, равно как и почтенному Джеральду Уорду, дежурному адъютанту. Из окон ДХК вице-королевский кортеж наблюдали Бык Маллиган и Хейнс, первый с видом смешливым, второй  серьезным, глядя между голов возбужденных посетителей, совсем загородивших от света шахматную доску, на которую был устремлен пристальный взгляд Джона Хауарда Парнелла. На Фаунс-стрит Дилли Дедал, подняв взгляд от французского учебника Шарденаля, увидала раскрытые зонтики и сверкающие, вертящиеся спицы колес. Джон Генри Ментон, стоя в дверях Торговой палаты, неподвижно выпучил набрякшие от вина глаза-устрицы, держа толстые золотые охотничьи часы в толстой левой руке, не глядя на них и уже не чувствуя их.Там, где в воздух вздымалась передняя нога лошади короля Билли[], миссис Брин отдернула своего поторопившегося супруга назад из-под копыт форейторской лошади. Крича ему прямо в ухо, она разъяснила происходящее.Тот понял, прижал свои фолианты левой рукой и приветствовал вторую карету.Почтенный Джеральд Уорд, дежурный адъютант, будучи приятно изумлен, поспешил ответить. На углу возле Понсонби остановился, притомившись, белый флакон ., и вслед за ним остановились еще четыре белых флакона в цилиндрах, ...., меж тем как мимо промчались кареты и верховые.Против торговли музыкальными инструментами Пиготта внушительно вышагивал в живописном наряде мистер Дэнис Дж.Маджинни, учитель танцев и пр., коего вице-король обогнал, не заметив. У ректорского же дома появился с беспечным видом Буян Бойлан, ноги которого в рыжих штиблетах и носках с небесно-голубыми стрелками переступали в такт мотивчику песенки Моя йоркширская девчонка. В пику небесно-голубым налобникам и стремительному напору верховых Буян Бойлан выставил небесно-голубой галстук, соломенную широкополую шляпу, ухарски сдвинутую набекрень, и синий костюм тонкого шевиота. Его руки, засунутые в карманы пиджака, не нашли нужным снять шляпу, однако он презентовал трем дамам нахальное одобрение во взгляде и красный цветок в зубах. Проезжая по Нассау-стрит, Его Сиятельство привлек внимание своей супруги, милостиво кивавшей по сторонам, к музыкальной программе, исполнявшейся в Колледж-парке. Бравые парни с шотландских гор, невидимые, трубили и барабанили вослед процессии:Моя девчонка  с фабрики,Одета без затей.Тарарабум.Но сердце мое тянется,Эх, к розочке из Йоркшира,К возлюбленной моей.Тарарабум.По ту сторону стены участники гонки на четверть мили с гандикапом М.К.Грин, Х.Трифт, Т.М.Пейти, К.Скейфи, Дж.Б.Джеффс, Г.Н.Морфи, Ф.Стивенсон, К.Эдрли и У.К.Хаггард стартовали поочередно. Шагая мимо отеля Финна, Кэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл уставил рассерженный монокль поверх экипажей на голову мистера М.Е.Соломонса[] в окне австро-венгерского вице-консульства. В глубине Ленстер-стрит, возле заднего входа Тринити, верноподданный Его Величества Хорнблоуэр притронулся к своей егерской фуражке. Когда гладко лоснящиеся кони галопом мчали по Меррион-сквер, ожидавший там юный Патрик Алоизиус Дигнам увидел, как все приветствуют господина в цилиндре, и тоже приподнял свою черную новенькую фуражку пальцами, жирными от обертки свиных котлет. Воротничок его опять отстегнулся. Вице-король, направлявшийся на торжественное открытие благотворительного базара Майрас в пользу больницы Мерсера, проследовал со своею свитой в сторону Нижней Маунт-стрит. Возле лавки Бродбента они миновали слепого юношу. На Нижней Маунт-стрит пешеход в коричневом макинтоше, жуя черствую корку, быстро и беспрепятственно перебежал вице-королю дорогу. На мосту через Королевский канал[] мистер Юджин Стрэттон, ухмыляясь с афиши толстыми выпяченными губами, радушно приветствовал всех прибывающих в квартал Пембрук. На углу Хэддингтон-роуд две женщины, выпачканные в песке, несущие зонтик и сумку, где перекатывались одиннадцать ракушек, остановились в удивлении при виде лорд-мэра с лорд-мэршей и без золотой цепи[]. На Нортамберленд-роуд и Лэндсдаун-роуд Его Сиятельство неукоснительно отвечал на поклоны редких прохожих мужского пола, на поклон двух малолетних школьников, стоявших у садовой калитки того дома, которым, как говорят, восхищалась покойная королева[] при своем посещении ирландской столицы вместе с супругом, принцем-консортом, в  году, и на поклон обширных штанов Альмидано Артифони, мелькнувших в дверях, которые, поглотив их, захлопнулись.Эпизод []За бронзой золото услыхало цокопыт сталезвон.Беспардон дондондон.Соринки, соскребая соринки с заскорузлого ногтя.

Моя эпррритапфффия.Кончил.Начинай!За бронзой золото, головка мисс Кеннеди за головкой мисс Дус, поверх занавески бара, слушали как проносятся вице-королевские копыта, как звенит сталь. А это она?  спросила мисс Кеннеди.Мисс Дус отвечала да, сидит рядом с самим, в жемчужно-сером и   .[] Какое изящное сочетание,  сказала мисс Кеннеди.Вдруг вся оживившись, мисс Дус возбужденно проговорила: Смотри-ка, вон тот, в цилиндре! Где-где? Который?  откликнулось еще возбужденней золото. Во второй карете,  сказали смеющиеся губы мисс Дус, влажно блеснув на солнце.  Сюда смотрит. Пусти-ка, гляну.Бронзовою стрелой метнулась она к другому окну, расплюснула лицо на стекле, в туманном кружке от ее возбужденного дыхания.Влажные губы прощебетали: Заметил! Убит насмерть!Она хихикнула: Я рыдаю! Эти мужчины  ну потрясающие идиоты!Впрочем, не без печали.Мисс Кеннеди печально прогуливалась, выйдя из полосы света и заплетая выбившуюся прядку волос за ушком. Печально прогуливаясь, уж золотом не сияя, она закручивала, заплетала прядку. Печально заплетала она загулявшую золотую прядку за изогнутым ушком. Уж кому раздолье, так это им,  печально возразила она.Мужчина.Блукто двигался мимо трубок Муленга, храня на груди прелести греха, мимо антиквариата Уайна, храня в памяти прелестные греховные речи, мимо тусклого и погнутого столового серебра Кэрролла, ради Рауля.Коридорный к ним, к ним в баре, к ним барменшам подошел. Для них, его не удостоивших взглядом, брякнул на стойку он поднос с задребезжавшими чашками. И  Вот он, чай ваш,  сказал.Мисс Кеннеди с манерными жестами переставила поднос ниже, на перевернутый ящик от минеральной воды, подальше от взоров, вниз. Это чего там?  звонко полюбопытствовал не знающий манер коридорный. Сам догадайся,  отрезала мисс Дус, покидая свой наблюдательный пункт. Твой ухажер, небось?На что бронза с высокомерием: Я на тебя пожалуюсь миссис де Месси, если еще раз услышу такое беспардонное нахальство. Беспардон дондондон,  огрызнулось дерзкое рыло, меж тем как он двинулся прочь как она грозилась откуда пришел.Блум.Нахмурившись над своим цветком, мисс Дус заявила: Этот шпингалет совсем распустился. Если он не будет себя прилично вести, я ему уши оборву.С видом леди, изящное сочетание. Не обращай внимания,  посоветовала мисс Кеннеди.Она налила чай в чашку, потом снова в чайник из чашки. Они укрылись за скалой стойки, поджидая на подставках, ящиках стоймя, пока чай настоится.Они оправляли блузки из черного атласа, метр два шиллинга девять, поджидая, пока чай настоится, и два шиллинга семь.Да, за бронзой вблизи золото поодаль слышали сталь вблизи, звон копыт поодаль, слышали сталь копыт, звон копыт, звонкосталь. Правда, я страшно загорела?Мисс бронза раскрыла блузку на шее. Нет,  отвечала мисс Кеннеди,  потемнеет потом, не сразу. А ты не пробовала развести борную в лавровишневой воде?Мисс Дус, привстав, поглядела сбоку на свою кожу в зеркале бара, несущем златобронзовые литеры на раме и отражающем крупную раковину в кругу бокалов рейнского и бургонского. Ага, потом на руках останется,  возразила она. А ты с глицерином,  предлагала мисс Кеннеди.Окинув шею и руки прощальным взглядом, мисс Дус  От этих средств только сыпь выступает,  отвергла, села на место.  Я того старого сыча у Бойда просила мне дать что-нибудь для кожи.Мисс Кеннеди, разливая настоявшийся чай, с гримаской взмолилась: Ах, бога ради, не напоминай мне о нем! Нет, погоди, дай я расскажу,  настаивала мисс Дус.Чай сладкий свой долив молоком, мисс Кеннеди ушки зажала пальчиками. Ах нет, не надо!  воскликнула она. Я не слышу, не слышу!  воскликнула она.Но Блум?Мисс Дус передразнила гнусавое старческое ворчанье: Для чего, для чего? это он мне.Мисс Кеннеди отняла пальчики, чтоб слышать, чтоб говорить  но снова сказала, снова взмолилась: Ах, не говори про него, я не вынесу! Противный старый Урод! Помнишь, в тот вечер, в зале Эншент.С миной отвращения она сделала глоток крепкого горячего чаю  глотнула  глоток сладкого чаю. Смотри, какой он был,  сказала мисс Дус, вывернув кособоко бронзовую головку и раздув ноздри.  Хр-р! Хр-р!Пронзительный взрыв смеха вырвался из горла мисс Кеннеди. Мисс Дус сопела и всхрапывала сквозь ноздри, которые шевелились словно вынюхивающее рыло беспардондондондон. Я не могу!  стонала, повизгивая, мисс Кеннеди.  Ты помнишь, какие у него глаза выпученные?Тут залилась и мисс Дус звонкобронзовым смехом: Ох, как бы он нас не сглазил!Блучьи темные глаза прочитали имя: Арон Фигфурт. А почему мне всегда читается Фигфунт? Выходит фунт фиг, наверно поэтому. Проспер Лоре  гугенотская фамилия. Темные глаза Блума скользнули по пресвятым девам в витрине Басси. Голубой плащ, под ним белизна, приидите ко мне. Они верят, что она бог  или богиня? Сегодняшние богини. Не удалось разглядеть.Подошел тот парень. Студент. Потом он с сыном Дедала. Наверно, это Маллиган. Весьма миловидные девы. Вот что и привлекает этих развратников: ее белизна.Дальше и дальше скользили его глаза. Прелести греха. Прелестные прелести.Греха.Закатываясь заливистым смехом, два голоса молодых слили Дус и Кеннеди, златобронза, ох, сглазит. Запрокидывая головки, смехобронзу и смехозлато, чтоб без помех лился смех, взвизгивали, сглазит, делали знаки друг другу, издавая высокие пронзительные ноты.А ах, задыхаясь, затихают. Затихая, а-ах, затухая, замерло их веселье.Мисс Кеннеди снова поднесла к губам чашку, но едва сделала глоток, как тут же снова захихихикала. Мисс Дус, наклонившись к подносу, снова наморщила нос и принялась потешно вращать выпученными глазами. Снова Хихикеннеди, наклонясь, так что корона ее волос, наклонясь, показала черепаховый гребень на затылке, прыснула прямо изо рта чаем, захлебнувшись чаем и смехом, захлебываясь, кашляя, взвизгивая: Сальные глазки! Представь-ка себя замужем за таким! С его бороденочкой!Дус в ответ испустила блистательный вопль, истинно женский вопль, в котором звучали восторг, ликование, презрение. Замужем за сальным носом!  возопила она.Смеясь то на низких, то на высоких нотах, то бронзой звеня, то золотом, подзуживали они друг дружку на новые и новые всплески хохота, чередующимся перезвоном, бронза-злато, злато-бронза, высоко-низко, всплеск-еще-всплеск.И снова без конца хохотали. Ага, весь сальный, я знаю. В полном изнеможении, задыхаясь, вздрагивающие головы они прислонили к стойке, корону кос подле гладкоблестящей укладки. Раскрасневшиеся (Уф-ф!), вспотевшие, тяжело дыша (Уф-ф!), обе еле переводили дух.За Блумом замужем, за сальнозасаленным! Силы небесные!  вздохнула мисс Дус над своей вздрагивающей розой.  Лучше б я так не смеялась. Прямо вся взмокла. О, мисс Дус!  возмутилась мисс Кеннеди.  Что за ужасное создание!И закраснелась еще сильней (фу, как ужасно!), став еще золотистей.Мимо конторы Кантвелла брел Сальноблум, мимо дев Чеппи[], сияющих масляною краской. У Наннетти отец торговал вразнос этим товаром, обивал пороги как я. Религия  доходное дело. Надо опять к нему насчет Ключчи. Но сначала поесть. Проголодался. Нет еще. Она сказала, в четыре. Время идет без остановки. Часы тикают. Ступай. Где бы поесть? Кларенс, Дельфин.Ступай. Ради Рауля. Поесть. Если бы набралось пять гиней с этих реклам.Комбинацию шелковую, сиреневую. Нет еще. Прелести греха.Румянец убавился  еще убавился  золотистая бледность.Праздной походкой в бар к ним вошел мистер Дедал. Соринки, соскребая соринки с заскорузлого ногтя большого пальца. Соринки. Праздной вошел походкой. А, с возвращением вас, мисс Дус.Подал ей руку. Хорошо отдохнули? Шик-блеск.Он выразил надежду, что с погодой в Ростреворе ей повезло. Погода дивная,  сказала мисс Дус.  Можете судить по мне  ничего видик, правда? Целыми днями на пляже.Бронзовая белизна. Это с вашей стороны так жестоко,  попенял ей мистер Дедал, милостиво поглаживая по руке.  Искушать бедненьких простачков мужчин.Атласная мисс Дус мягко высвободила руку. Ах, оставьте,  проговорила она.  Уж вы-то простак, так я вам и поверила.А он был. Да нет, знаете,  рассуждал он,  все-таки я простак. Когда я лежал в колыбельке, у меня был вид до того простодушный, что меня так и окрестили:простак Саймон[]. Тогда вы, наверно, были просто душка,  последовал ответ мисс Дус.  А что вам доктор прописал на сегодня? Да знаете,  рассуждал он,  это на ваше усмотрение. Пожалуй, если вас не затруднит, то я попросил бы чистой воды и полстаканчика виски.Позвякиванье. Моментально,  отозвалась мисс Дус.Моментально и грациозно к золоченому зеркалу, отражающему продукцию Кантрелла и Кокрейна, она обернулась. Грациозно отмерила порцию золотистого виски из хрустального графина. Мистер Дедал между тем извлек из-под полы своего сюртука кисет и трубку. Моментально обслуживает. Он выдул через флейту мундштука две сиплые ноты. Клянусь вам,  рассуждал он,  я уже сколько раз сам туда собирался, в горы Морн. Там должен быть отличный бодрящий воздух. Но, говорят, долго сбирался  верней добрался. Да-да. Да.Да. Он набил свой чубук волокнами, волосками ее волос, светлых волос Виргинии, русалки[]. Волокна. Волоски. Рассуждая. Беззвучно.Никто ни звука не произнес. Да.Мисс Дус весело протирала бокалы, напевая: О, Адолорес, краса восточных морей![] А мистер Лидуэлл заходил сегодня?В бар вошел Ленехан. Осмотрелся кругом. Мистер Блум достиг моста Эссекс. Дэ-с, и мост Дэссекс перешел мистер Блум. Надо написать Марте.Бумаги купить. У Дэли. Там любезная продавщица. Блум. Старина Блум.История заблумшей души. Он заходил в обед,  сказала мисс Дус.Ленехан приблизился к стойке. Тут меня не разыскивал мистер Бойлан?Спросил он. Она отвечала: Мисс Кеннеди, сюда не заходил мистер Бойлан, пока я была наверху?Спросила она. Мисс Кеннеди голос отвечал, чаю вторая чашка на пути ко рту, взгляд прикован к странице: Нет, его не было.Мисс Кеннеди взор, слышимой, но невидимой, продолжал чтение. Ленехан шустро окрутил кругленький корпус вокруг колпака, прикрывавшего сандвичи. А ну-ка, кто у нас тут?Взгляда Кеннеди не удостоившись, он предпринял новые попытки. Не забывайте про точки. Читайте вот эти черненькие значки: круглое  это о, а крючком  эс.Резво позвякивала коляска.Златодева читала, не глядя по сторонам. Не обращай внимания. Она не обращала, а он, как ученик по слогам, монотонно и нараспев, принялся читать ей басню: Ад-нажды лисица всы-ты-ретила аиста. И га-ва-рит лиса аисту: пра-сунь свой кы-люв ка мне в гор-ла и вы-та-щи кость.Попусту он бубнил. Мисс Дус отвернулась к своей чашке, стоявшей чуть в стороне.Он вздохнул в сторону: О, горе мне! О я, несчастный!Он обратился с приветствием к мистеру Дедалу и получил ответный кивок. Привет от прославленного сына прославленного отца. Кто б это был?  поинтересовался мистер Дедал.Ленехан с наисердечнейшим видом развел руками. Как кто? Кто б это был?  переспросил он.  И вы можете спрашивать? Стивен, наш юный бард.Сухо[].Мистер Дедал, прославленный боец, отложил свою трубку, набитую сухим табаком. Понятно,  сказал он.  Сначала до меня не дошло. Я слышал, что он вращается в самом избранном обществе. А вы его видели недавно?Видел. Не далее как сегодня мы вместе с ним осушали чаши амброзии,  поведал Ленехан.  У Муни   и Муни  [].Подвиги его музы принесли ему толику наличности.Он улыбнулся устам бронзы, чаем омытым, внимающим устам и глазам. Элита Эрина ловила каждый звук с его уст. Ученый профессор Хью Макхью, знаменитейший борзописец и издатель нашего города, и тот певец младой с дикого и сырого Запада, что отзывается на сладкозвучное имя ОМэдден Берк.После некоторого молчания мистер Дедал поднял стакан и  Надо полагать, это было очень занимательно,  произнес он.  Теперь я вижу.Он вижу. Он отхлебнул. Взором витая в далеких печальных горах, в горах Морн. Поставил стакан.Он посмотрел в раскрытую дверь салона. Я вижу, вы переставили рояль. Сегодня приходил настройщик,  объяснила мисс Дус,  чтобы настроить его для ресторанной программы. Я в жизни не слышала такой изящной игры. В самом деле? Ведь правда, мисс Кеннеди? Просто классическая игра. И знаете, он слепой. Бедный юноша, ему и двадцати лет не дашь. В самом деле?  повторил мистер Дедал.Он снова отхлебнул и отошел в сторону. Так было жалко смотреть на его лицо,  сочувствовала мисс Дус.Будь ты проклят, чертов ублюдок.К ее сожаленью, звонок жалобно звякнул, вызов официанта. К дверям обеденной залы направился лысый Пэт, направился озабоченный Пэт, направился Пэт-официант. Пива клиенту. Пива отнюдь не моментально отпустила она.Ленехан ждал терпеливо нетерпеливого буяна Бойлана, поджидал резвого звяканья.Приподняв крышку, он (кто?) заглянул в гроб (гроб?), где шли наискось тройные (рояля!) струны. Он погладил (тот самый, кто милостиво поглаживал ее по руке) тройку клавиш, нажал на них, мягко педалируя, чтобы увидеть, как выдвигается вперед мягкий фетр, услышать приглушенное падение молоточков.Два листа веленевой кремовой бумаги один про запас два конверта когда я служил у Хили премудрый Блум Генри Флауэр купил у Дэли. Так ты несчастлив в семейной жизни? Цветочек мне в утешение а булавка оборвет лю. Что-то в этом есть в языке цве. Это маргаритка была? Невинность значит.Благонравная девица повстречать после мессы. Паакорна благодарим.Премудрый Блум узрел на дверях рекламу, курящая русалка колышется на волнах. Курите русалку, это легчайшие сигареты. Струящиеся пряди волос  несчастная любовь. Ради какого-то мужчины. Ради Рауля. Он глянул и увидел вдали, на мосту Эссекс, яркую шляпу, маячившую над легкой коляской. Так и есть. Третий раз. Совпадение.Позвякивая, колыхаясь на тугих шинах, коляска свернула с моста на набережную Ормонд. За ним. Рискнуть. Только надо быстрей. В четыре. Уже скоро. Ступай. С вас два пенса, сэр,  решилась напомнить продавщица. Ах, да Я совсем забыл ПроститеИ четыре.Она в четыре. Она чарующе улыбнулась Блукомуему. Блу улыб и быст выш.Дня. Думаешь ты у ней главная спица в колеснице? Она так каждому. Всем мужчинам.В дремотной тишине склонилось золото над страницей.Из салона донесся долгий, медленно замирающий звук. То был камертон настройщика, который он забыл, который он задел. Снова звук. Который он сейчас взял, который сейчас вибрировал. Слышите? Он вибрировал, все чище и чище, мягче и мягче, двумя своими жужжащими ветвями. Еще медленней замирающий звук.Пэт уплатил за бутылку с тугою пробкою для клиента  и вот поверх подноса, бокала, тугопробкой бутылки, лысый и тугоухий, вот он вступил, тихонько, вместе с мисс Дус: Уж меркнут звезды[]Безгласно из глубины пела песнь, выпевая: утро брезжит .Стайка крылатых нот, из-под чутких выпорхнув пальцев, прощебетала звонкий ответ. Хрустальные радостные ноты, сливаясь в гармонические аккорды, призывали голос, который воспел бы томление росистого утра, юности, прощанья с любовью, воспел бы утро жизни и утро любви. И жемчуг росГубы Ленехана над стойкой вывели тихий зовущий свист. Но взгляните же,  сказал он,  о, роза Кастилии.Звякнув, коляска замерла у обочины.Поднявшись, свою книгу она закрыла, роза Кастилии. Страдающая и одинокая, в задумчивости она поднялась. Она сама пала или ее подтолкнули?  спросил он.Свысока она бросила: Кто ни о чем не спрашивает, тому не солгут[].Как леди, настоящая леди.Буяна Бойлана модные рыжие штиблеты ступали, поскрипывая, по полу бара.Да, золото взблизи, бронза поодаль. Ленехан услышал, узнал, приветствовал: Грядет герой-покоритель[].Между коляской и окном, крадучись, пробирался Блум, непокоренный герой.Заметить может. Сидел на этом сиденье: теплое. Черный кот, крадучись, пробирался, правя на портфель Ричи Гулдинга, приветно поднятый в воздухе. И мы с тобой Я знал, что ты тут,  сказал Буян Бойлан.В честь блондинки мисс Кеннеди он коснулся полей набекрень скошенного канотье. Она подарила ему улыбку. Однако сестрица бронза улыбкою ее превзошла, пригладив и оправив ради него свои еще более роскошные волосы, и бюст, и розу.Бойлан заказал зелья. Чего твоя душа жаждет? Горького пива? Стаканчик горького, пожалуйста, и терновый джин  для меня. Еще нет телеграммы?Нет еще. В четыре она. Все говорят четыре.Красные уши и кадык Каули в дверях полицейского управлении. Избежать. А Гулдинг  это удача. Чего ему надо в Ормонде? Коляска ждет. Надо ждать.Привет. Куда направляетесь? Перекусить? И я как раз тоже. Сюда вот.Как, в Ормонд? Лучшее, что есть в Дублине. В самом деле? В ресторан. И там  тихо. Смотри, а тебя чтоб не видели. Что же, пожалуй, и я с вами.Вперед. Ричи шел первым. Блум следовал за портфелем. Трапеза, достойная принца.Мисс Дус потянулась достать графин, атласная ручка вытянута изо всех сил, блузка на груди вот-вот лопнет, так высоко. О! О!  крякал Ленехан при каждом ее новом усилии.  О!Однако успешно она овладела добычей и с торжеством ее опустила вниз. Отчего вы не подрастете, мисс?  спросил Буян Бойлан.Бронзоволосая, наливая из графина тягучий сладкий напиток для его уст, глядя на тягучую струйку (цветок у него в петлице, от кого это, интересно?), сладким голосом протянула: Мал золотник, да дорог.О себе то есть. Налила аккуратно сладкотягучего терна. Ваше здоровье,  сказал Буян.Он бросил на стойку крупную монету. Монета звякнула. Постойте-постойте,  сказал Ленехан,  я тоже За ваше,  присоединился он, поднимая вспененный эль. Корона выиграет, это как пить дать,  заверил он. Я тоже малость рискнул,  сказал Бойлан и, подмигнув, выпил.  Не за себя, правда. Одному другу взбрело.Ленехан потягивал пиво и ухмылялся, то на пиво поглядывая, то на губки мисс Дус, полуоткрытые, тихонько мурлыкающие песнь морей, которую прежде они выводили звонко. Адолорес. Восточные моря.Часы зашипели. Мисс Кеннеди прошла мимо них (но от кого же этот цветок), унося поднос с чашками. Кукушка закуковала.Мисс Дус взяла монету со стойки, резко крутнула ручку кассы. Касса дзинькнула. Кукушка прокуковала. Прекрасная египтянка, соблазнительно изгибаясь, позвякивая монетами в ящике, напевая, отсчитывала сдачу. С надеждой смотри на закат[]. Пробили. Для меня. Это сколько пробило?  спросил Буян Бойлан.  Четыре?Часа.Ленехан, маленькими глазками пожирая ее, напевающую, и напевающий бюст, потянул Бойлана за рукав. Давайте-ка послушаем бой часов,  предложил он.Фирменный портфель Гулдинга, Коллиса и Уорда вел за собой заблумшую душу, Блума, между бездушных столиков. Неуверенный, с возбужденной уверенностью, под выжидательным взглядом лысого Пэта, выбрал он столик поближе к двери. Будь поближе. В четыре. Он что, забыл? Или тут хитрость?Не прийти, раздразнить аппетит. Я бы не смог так. Но выжди, выжди. Пэт, наблюдая, выжидал.Искрящаяся бронзы лазурь окинула небесно-голубые глаза и галстук Голубойлана. Ну, давайте,  настаивал Ленехан.  Как раз нет никого. А он ни разу не слышал. уже и солнце высоко[].Высокий и чистый звук поднимался ввысь.Бронза Дус, посекретничав с розой, ставши чуть розовой, пытливый кинула взгляд на цветок, на глаза Буяна. Просим, просим.Он упрашивал ее сквозь повторявшиеся признания: С тобой расстаться не могу Как-нибудь потом,  пообещала скромница Дус. Нет-нет, сейчас!  не отставал Ленехан.    []! Пожалуйста! Ведь нет никого.Она огляделась. Быстрый взгляд. Мисс Кен не услышит. Быстрый наклон.Два загоревшихся лица ловили каждое движение.Неуверенные аккорды сбились с мелодии, снова ее нащупали, снова теряли и снова ловили, спотыкаясь. Затерявшийся аккорд[]. Ну же! Действуйте! !Нагнувшись, она вздернула подол юбки выше колена. Помедлила. Еще помучила их, нагнувшись, выжидая, поглядывая лукаво. !Хлоп! Внезапно она оттянула, отпустила и тугая подвязка звонкохлопнула по зовущему похлопать тепложенскому тугому бедру.  !  радостно вскричал Ленехан.  Сама научилась! Это вам не опилки.Она надменно усмехлыбнулась (рыдаю! эти мужчины), но, скользнув к свету, улыбнулась Бойлану ласково. Вы просто воплощение вульгарности,  сказала она, скользя.Бойлан все смотрел на нее. Кубок свой поднеся к полным губам, осушил он крохотный кубок, втянул последние синеватые капли, густые и полновесные.Зачарованно взгляд его провожал головку, в пространстве бара скользившую к зеркалам, в золоченой арке которых мерцали бокалы эля, рейнского и бургонского и рогатая раковина. Там, в зеркалах отраженная, бронза ее слилась с бронзой еще более солнечной.Да, бронза совсем вблизи. Мой милый друг, прощай! Все, ухожу,  нетерпеливо проговорил Бойлан.Кубок свой резко отодвинул, взял сдачу. Погоди малость,  забеспокоился Ленехан, допивая поспешно.  Мне надо тебе сказать. Том Рочфорд Да иди к богу в рай,  бросил Буян уже на ходу.Ленехан срочно опрокинул остатки. Зачесалось у тебя, что ли?  недоумевал он.  Погоди, я иду.Он пустился за быстрыми поскрипываньями башмаков, но у порога проворно осадил, приветствуя две фигуры, грузную и щуплую. Мое почтение, мистер Доллард! Что-что? Почтение! Почтение!  рассеянно откликнулся бас Бена Долларда, на миг оторвавшись от горестей отца Каули.  Ничего он вам не сделает, Боб. Олф Берген поговорит с долговязым. На сей раз мы этому Иуде Искариоту вставим перо.Через салон проследовал мистер Дедал, вздыхая и потрагивая пальцем веко. Хо-хо, ей-ей,  вывел тирольскую руладу Бен Доллард.  Саймон, а вы бы спели нам что-нибудь. Мы слышали тут звуки рояля.Лысый Пэт, озабоченный официант, ожидал, пока закажут напитки. Так, Ричи  виски. А Блуму? Подумать надо. Не гонять его лишний раз. Небось, мозоли. Четыре. Так жарко в черном. Конечно, и нервы тут. Преломляет (или как там?) тепло. Надо подумать. Сидр. Да, бутылку сидра. С какой стати?  возразил мистер Дедал.  Это я просто так бренчал. Ничего-ничего, давайте,  не отставал Бен Доллард.  Сгиньте, заботы[].Идемте, Боб.Рысцой он двинулся, Доллард, в необъятных штанах, впереди них (держите-ка мне вот этого в: ну-ну, давайте) в салон. Он плюхнулся, Доллард, на табурет. Плюхнулись узловатые лапы на клавиши. И замерли, плюхнувшись.Лысый Пэт встретил в дверях златовласку, которая бесчайною возвращалась. Озабоченный, он желал виски и сидр. Бронзоволосая у окна сидела, бронза поодаль.Звякнув, резво взяла с места коляска.Блум услыхал звяканье, слабый звук. Уезжает. Слабый и судорожный вздох обратил он к немым голубеющим цветам. Звякнуло. Уехал. Звякнув. Слушай. Любовь и войну[], Бен,  сказал мистер Дедал.  Как в добрые старые времена.Отважная мисс Дус, оставленная всеми взорами, отвела свой от занавески, не выдержав сокрушающего блеска лучей. Уехал. Задумчивая (кто знает?), сокрушенная (сокрушающие лучи), она опустила штору, дернув за шнур.Облекла задумчиво (почему он так быстро уехал, когда я[]?) свою бронзу и бар, где стоял лысый подле златовласой сестрицы, неизящное сочетание, сочетание неизящное, антиизящное, в тихую прохладную смутную зеленоватую колышащуюся глубокую сень,   . В тот вечер бедняга Гудвин аккомпанировал,  вспомнил и отец Каули.  Только они с роялем не совсем сходились во мнениях.Не совсем. И устроили бурный спор,  дополнил мистер Дедал.  Ему тогда сам черт был не брат. На старичка порой находило в легком подпитии. Мать честная, а я-то, помните?  вступил и Бен дылда Доллард, оборачиваясь от многострадальных клавишей.  У меня еще как на грех не было свадебного наряда.Все трое расхохотались. Он был рад, да наряд. Расхохоталось все трио.Свадебного наряда не было. Но тут, нам на счастье, подвернулся дружище Блум,  продолжил мистер Дедал.  А, кстати, где моя трубка?За трубкой за затерявшимся аккордом зашаркал он назад к стойке. Пэт лысый принес напитки Ричи и Польди. И отец Каули засмеялся опять. Это ведь я тогда спас положение, Бен. Не спорю,  признал Бен Доллард.  Я как сейчас помню эти узкие брючки. Вас осенила блестящая мысль, Боб.Отец Каули покраснел до самых мочек ушей, розовых и блестящих. Он. Спас поло. Эти брю. Блесмыс. Я знал, что он на мели,  сказал он.  Жена его по субботам играла на пианино в кофейне за какие-то жалкие гроши, и кто-то мне подсказал, что она этим тоже занимается. Вы помните? Мы их разыскивали по всей Холлс-стрит, пока нам приказчик у Кео не дал адрес. Помните?Бен вспоминал, и на широком лице его возникало изумленное выражение. Мать честная, чего у нее там не было, какие-то роскошные оперные плащи.Трубку зажав, назад зашаркал мистер Дедал. В стиле Меррион-сквер[]. Мать честная, бальные платья, платья для приемов. И он никак не хотел взять деньги. Каково? Кучи каких-то, черт дери, треуголок, болеро, панталон. Каково? Вот-вот,  закивал мистер Дедал.  У миссис Мэрион Блум можно снять платье любого рода.Позвякивала по набережным коляска. Буян развалился на тугих шинах.Печенка с беконом. Почки и говядина в тесте. Хорошо, сэр. Хорошо, Пэт.Миссис Мэрион метим псу хвост. Запах горелого Поль де Кока. Симпатичное имя у. А как ее девичья фамилия? Пикантная девица была. Мэрион Твиди. Да-да. А жива она? Еще как. Она ведь была дочерью Дочерью полка[]. В самую точку, ей-ей. Я помню этого старого тамбурмажора.Мистер Дедал чиркнул, высек, разжег, выдохнул душистый клуб в заключенье. Ирландка ли? Ей-ей, не могу сказать. А вы не знаете, Саймон?За клубом еще клуб, душистый, крепкий, густой, потрескивая. Щечный мускул Что? Малость заржавел Ну как же, она конечноО, Молль, ирландочка моя.Выпустил пахучий залп, пышный клуб. С Гибралтарских скал прямиком.Они томились в тени океанских глубин, золото у пивного насоса, бронза возле бутылок мараскина, обе в задумчивости, Майна Кеннеди, Лисмор-Террас , Драмкондра, с Адолорес, красою, Долорес, безмолвной.Пэт подал заказ на незакрытых тарелках. Леопольд принялся нарезать печенку на ломтики. Как уже было сказано, он с удовольствием ел внутренние органы, пупки с орехами, жареные наважьи молоки, между тем как Ричи Гулдинг, Коллис, Уорд ел говядину и почки, то говядину то почки, запеченные кусочки ел он ел Блум они ели.Блум с Гулдингом, молчанием обрученные, ели. Трапезы принцев.По Бэйчлорз-уок[] позвякивала коляска на тугих шинах, катил в ней вольный холостяк Буян Бойлан  по солнцу, по жаре, под щелканье хлыста над гладким крупом кобылки  на теплом сиденье развалясь, дерзкого пыла и нетерпения полн. Зачесалось. У тебя? Зачесалось. У тебя?Заче заче-салось.Перекрывая все голоса, перегромыхивая гремящие аккорды, ринулся в бой бас Долларда: Когда любовь в душе горитРаскаты Бендушебенджамина докатились до сотрясаемых содрогнувшихся от любви стекол крыши. Война! Война!  вскричал отец Каули.  Вот это воин! Что правда, то правда,  захохотал Бен Воин.  Я как раз думал про вашего домохозяина. До победного конца.Он смолк. Огромною бородой и огромною головой покачал он по поводу его огромного промаха. Старина, вы бы ей наверняка разорвали барабанную перепонку,  проговорил мистер Дедал сквозь аромат дыма,  этаким-то вашим органом.Зайдясь смехом, бородатым и богатырским, Доллард сотрясался над клавишами. Наверняка разорвал бы. Не говоря уж о другой перепонке,  добавил отец Каули.  Вполсилы, Бен.    [].Позвольте-ка мне.Мисс Кеннеди принесла двум джентльменам по кружке холодного портера.Обронила два слова. Да, согласился первый джентльмен, погодка отменная.Они потягивали свой портер. А не знает ли она, куда направлялся вице-король? Слышали сталь копыт, звон копыт, звон. Нет, она не могла сказать. Но ведь об этом должно быть в газете. О, ей не стоит себя утруждать. Ничего трудного. Развернув Индепендент, она замелькала страницами, разыскивая, вице-король, корона, не королевская, колыхалась в такт, вице-ко. Это слишком хлопотно, сказал первый джентльмен. Нет-нет, нисколько. А как он при этом посмотрел. Вице-король. За бронзой золото слышали стали звон. в душе горит, Других забот уж нет.В печеночной подливке Блум разминал мятый картофель. Любовь и войну кто-то там. Коронный номер Бена Долларда. Прибежал к нам в тот вечер просить фрачную пару для концерта. Брюки узки, в обтяжку как барабан.Боров музыкант. Молли обхохоталась потом, когда он ушел. Бросилась на кровать поперек, дрыгает ногами, стонет от смеха. Ты видел, у него весь прибор на выставку. Ох, дева Мария, я не выдержу! Вот дамам-то в первом ряду! Ох, никогда так не хохотала! А что, на этом у него и держится весь бас-бормотон. Не сравнишь с евнухом. Кто же это там играет. Отличное туше.Должно быть, Каули. Музыкален. Любую ноту назовет сразу. А с дыханием у бедняги худо. Перестал.Мисс Дус, чарующая Лидия Дус, мило кивнула входящему Джорджу Лидуэллу, весьма обходительному джентльмену, стряпчему. Добрый день. Она протянула свою влажную ручку, ручку леди, его твердому пожатию. Да, вернулась уже.За старую канитель. А ваши друзья уже там, мистер Лидуэлл.Джордж Лидуэлл ее обходительно пообхаживал, подержал лидоручку.Блум поедал печ, как уже было сказано. По крайней мере, тут чисто. Не то, что у Бертона. Тот малый с его месивом из хрящей. А тут никого, я да Гулдинг. Чистые столики, цветы, салфетки митрами. Пэт туда-сюда снует, лысый Пэт. Ничего не скажешь. Лучшее, что есть в Дуб.Снова звуки рояля. Явно Каули. Садится за рояль, как сливается с ним, полное взаимопонимание. Тоскливые точильщики скребут скрипки, скосив глаза на конец смычка, пилят несчастную виолончель, пока у тебя зубы не заболят.Ее тоненькое похрапыванье. В тот вечер, когда мы в ложе. Тромбон под нами сопел как морж, а в антракте один трубач развинтил и давай выбивать слюни.У дирижера брюки мешком, ногами на месте возит-возит. Правильно, что их в яму прячут.Позвякивая коляска везет-везет.Вот разве арфа. Красиво. Мягкий золотой свет. Девушка играла на ней.Словно корма изящной. Хорошо этот соус подходит к. Золотой ладьи. Эрин.Арфа дивная однажды или дважды. Прохладные руки. Бен Хоут[], рододендроны. Все мы арфы[]. Я. Он. Старый. Молодой. Нет-нет, старина, я не могу,  застенчиво и смиренно отнекивался мистер Дедал.Энергично. Да валяйте же, гром и молния!  громыхнул Бен Доллард.  Как получится, так и получится. "", Саймон,  попросил отец Каули.Он сделал несколько шагов к краю сцены, простер свои длинные руки, принял скорбно-торжественное выражение. Хрипловато кадык его прохрипел негромко. И негромко запел он запыленному морскому пейзажу Последнее прощанье. Мыс, корабль, парус над волнами. Прощание. Прекрасная девушка на мысу, ветер треплет ее платочек, ветер овевает ее.Каули пел:  :   []Она не слышала Каули, махала платочком тому, кто уплыл, своему милому, ветру, любви, летящему парусу, вернись. Да валяйте же, Саймон. Эх, минули мои золотые деньки, Бен Ну, да ладноМистер Дедал положил свою трубку покоиться рядом с камертоном и, усевшись, тронул послушные клавиши. Нет-нет, Саймон,  живо обернулся отец Каули.  Пожалуйста, верную тональность. Тут до-бемоль.Послушные клавиши взяли выше, заговорили, засомневались, сознались, сбились.Отец Каули шагнул в глубь сцены. Давайте-ка, Саймон, я буду аккомпанировать,  сказал он.  Поднимайтесь.Мимо ананасных леденцов Грэма Лемона, мимо слона на вывеске Элвери, дребезжа, бежала коляска. Говядина, почки, печень, пюре  за трапезой, достойною принцев, сидели принцы Блум и Гулдинг. Принцы за трапезой, они поднимали бокалы, попивали виски и сидр.Прекраснейшая в мире ария для тенора, сказал Ричи; из Сомнамбулы.Некогда он ее слышал в исполнении Джо Мааса. Ах, этот Макгаккин! Да. В своей манере. Под мальчика из церковного хора. Этакий мальчик от мессы.Месс мальчик Маас. Лирический тенор, если угодно. Никогда этого не забуду.Никогда.С чутким сочувствием Блум над беспеченочным беконом увидал, как напряглись осунувшиеся черты. Поясница у него. И глаза блестят, все как при воспалении почек. Следующий номер программы. Повеселился, пора расплачиваться. Пилюли, толченый хлеб, цена за коробочку  гинея. Хоть чуть отсрочить. Мурлычет Долой к покойникам. Подходяще. И ест почки, нежнейшее  нежнейшей. Только не много ему проку от них. Лучшее, что есть в. Типично для него. Виски. Насчет напитков разборчив. Стакан с изъяном, новый стакан воды. Спички прикарманит со стойки, экономия. И тут же соверен промотает на ерунду. А когда надо, у него ни гроша. Однажды подшофе платить отказался за проезд. Интересный народ.Никогда Ричи не забудет тот вечер. Сколько жив будет  никогда. В старом Ройял, в райке с коротышкой Пиком. А когда первая нота.Тут сделали паузу уста Ричи.Сейчас наплетет вранья. О чем угодно насочиняет. И верит сам в свои бредни. Притом всерьез. Редкостный враль. Но все-таки память хорошая. И какая же это ария?  спросил Леопольд Блум. "Все уж потеряно".Ричи вытянул губы трубочкой. Начальная нота нежная фея тихонько шепнула: все. Дрозд. Пенье дрозда. Его дыханье, с легкостью певчей птицы, сквозь крепкие зубы, предмет его гордости, как флейта высвистывало горькую жалобу. Потеряно. Сочный звук. А тут две ноты в одной. Как-то слышал скворца в кустах боярышника, он у меня подхватывал мотив и переиначивал так и сяк. Все новый новый зов зовет и уж потерян вновь во всем. Эхо.Сколь нежен отклик. А как оно получается? Все потеряно. Скорбно высвистывал он. Рухнуло, отдано, потеряно.Блум, ближе наклонив Леопольдово ухо, поправлял краешек салфетки под вазой. Порядок. Да, я помню. Чудная ария. Она к нему пошла во сне.Невинность при лунном свете. Все равно удержать ее. Смелые, не ведают об опасности. Окликнуть по имени. Дать коснуться воды. Коляска позвякивает.Поздно. Сама стремилась пойти. В этом все дело. Женщина. Море удержать проще. Да: все потеряно. Прекрасная ария,  сказал Блум потерявший Леопольд.  Я ее хорошо знаю.Ричи Гулдинг никогда в жизни.Он тоже ее хорошо знает. Или чувствует. Все норовит о дочке. Мудрое дитя, что узнает отца, как выразился Дедал. Я?Блум искоса над беспеченочным наблюдал. Печать на лице: все потеряно.Живчик Ричи былых времен. Одни избитые штучки остались. Шевелить ушами.Кольцо от салфетки в глаз. Да сынка посылает со слезными прошениями.Косоглазого Уолтера, да, сэр, исполнено, сэр. Ни за что не обеспокоил бы, случайность, ожидал значительных сумм. Тысяча извинений.Опять рояль. Звук лучше, чем когда я последний раз слышал. Настроили, видно. Опять умолк.Доллард и Каули все понукали упирающегося певца, ну, давайте же. Давайте, Саймон. Ну же, Саймон. Леди и джентльмены, я бесконечно тронут вашими любезными просьбами. Ну же, Саймон. Ресурсы мои скромны, но если вы мне ссудите внимания, я попытаюсь вам спеть о разбитом сердце.Возле колпака, прикрывающего сандвичи, тенью прикрытая Лидия свою бронзу и розу с изяществом истинной леди дарила и отбирала  как Майна двум кружкам свою золотую корону в прохладной зелено-голубой   .Отзвучали зовущие аккорды вступления. Протяжно взывающему аккорду отозвался звенящий голос: Когда явился дивный обликРичи обернулся. Это Сай Дедал, его голос,  заметил он.Задетые за живое, закрасневшись, они слушали, впитывали тот поток дивный поток струящийся по коже членам сердцу душе хребту. Блум кивнул Пэту, лысый служитель Пэт плохо слышит, чтобы раскрыл двери бара. Двери, бара. Вот так. Хорошо. Служитель Пэт послушно стал слушать, глухарь тугоухий, у самых дверей стал, слушал. Мои печали унеслись.Сквозь тишину взывал к ним негромкий голос, не дождя шелест, не шепот листьев, не похожий на голос ни струн ни свирелей ни какужихтам цимбалов, касающийся их притихшего слуха словами, их притихших сердец воспоминаниями о жизни  своей у каждого. Полезно, полезно слушать: печали, свои у каждого, унеслись, едва лишь они услышали. Едва лишь они увидели, все потерявшие, Ричи, Польди, милосердие красоты, услышали от того, от кого уж никак не ждешь, ее милосердное мягколюбовное нежнолюбимое слово.Это любовь поет. Все та же старая сладкая песня любви. Блум медленно стянул резинку со своего пакетика. Любви старое сладкое   злато.Натянул на вилку, торчащую четырьмя пальцами, растянул, снял, натянул на две собственные чутко-тревожные четверни, окрутил их четырежды, восьмижды, октавой крепко опутал их. Полон счастья и надеждыУ теноров всегда масса женщин. Помогает быть в голосе. К его ногам летит букет, а в нем от дамочки привет. Вы мне вскружили. Катит, позвякивая, радуется. Его пение не для светской публики. Вскрюжат голову бедняжке. Надушилась для него. Какими духами твоя жена? Желаю знать.Коляска звяк. Стоп. Тут-тук. По пути к двери  последний взгляд в зеркало, непременно. Прихожая. Заходите. Ну, как дела? Все отлично. Куда тут у вас?Сюда? В сумочке у ней леденцы, орешки для освеженья дыхания. Что-что? Руки ласкали ее пышные.Увы! Голос набрал воздуха, поднялся, стал полнозвучным, гордым, сверкающим. Но то был миг, увы, недолгийДа, тембр по-прежнему изумительный. В Корке и воздух мягче и выговор у жителей. Этакий глупец! Ведь мог бы купаться в золоте. А слова он перевирает. Жену уморил и поет себе. Хотя со стороны не понять. Двоим никто не судья. Только как бы сам не сломался. На людях еще хорохорится.Все у него поет, и руки и ноги. Выпивает. Нервы истрепаны. Чтобы петь, нужно воздержание. Суп по диете Дженни Линд: бульон, шалфей, яйца сырые, полпинты сливок. Не суп, а мечта.Источал он истому, исподволь нарастающую. Полнозвучно переливался. Вот это в самую точку. О, дай! Возьми! Биенье, еще биенье, упругие гордые переливы.Слова? Музыка? Нет: это то, что за ними.Блум сплетал, расплетал, связывал, развязывал.Блум. Прилив жаркой тайной жадновпивай дрожи нахлынул излиться с музыкой, с желанием, темный вторгающийся впивай прилив. Покрой, оседлай, случайся, топчи. Возьми. Поры, расширяющиеся, чтоб расширяться. Возьми.Радость тепло касание. Возьми. Чтоб поток хлынул, отворив створы. Теченье, струя, поток, струя радости, трепет случки. Сейчас! Язык любви. надежды лучБлестит. Лидия для Лидуэлла чуть слышным писком совсем как леди муза выпискивает надежды луч.Это из Марты. Совпадение. Как раз собрался писать. Ария Лионеля. Твое красивое имя. Не могу писать. Прими от меня небольшой пода. Струны женского сердца идут через кошелек. Она ведь. Я назвала тебя противным мальчишкой. Но именно это имя  Марта. Именно сегодня. Как странно!Голос Лионеля вернулся, слабей, но без признаков утомления. Снова он пел для Ричи Польди Лидии Лидуэлла, пел для Пэтаслужителя, слушавшего, развесив уши. О том, как явился дивный облик, как унеслись печали, как взгляд, образ, слово зачаровали его, Гулда Лидуэлла, покорили сердце Пэта Блума.Правда жаль что не видишь его лица. Лучше воспринимается. Парикмахер у Дрейго всегда почему-то смотрит в лицо когда я к нему обращаюсь в зеркале.Но слышно тут лучше чем в баре хотя и дальше. И милый взглядВ первый раз я ее увидел на вечеринке у Мэта Диллона в Тереньюре. Она была в желтом, с черными кружевами. Играли в музыкальные стулья. Мы с ней вдвоем последние, Судьба. Быть при ней. Судьба. Кружились медленно. Потом быстро. Мы с ней вдвоем. Все смотрели. Потом стоп. И мигом она уселась.Все кто вышел смотрели. Смеющиеся губы. Колени желтые. Пленял мой взорПение. В тот раз пела Ожидание. Я переворачивал ноты. Голос полный аромата какими духами твоя сирени. Увидел грудь, обе полные, горло, льющее трели. Впервые увидел. Она поблагодарила. Почему она меня? Судьба. Глаза испанки. В этот час одна в своем патио под старой грушей в старом Мадриде наполовину в тени Долорес онадолорес. Меня. Маня. Заманивая. Марта! О, Марта!Оставив всю томность, Лионель возопил, страдая, испустил вопль нестерпимой страсти, гармоническими созвучиями, что опускались и поднимались, призывая любовь вернуться. Молящий клик Лионеля, чтобы она узнала, чтобы Марта почувствовала. Ее одну он ждал. Где? Тут и там поищи там и сям все ищите где. Где-нибудь. Ве-е-ернись, моя утрата!Ве е-ернись, моя любовь!Один. Одна любовь. Одна надежда. Одно утешение мне. Марта, грудной звук, вернись. Вернись!Она парила, птица, продолжала полет, чистый и быстрый звук, парящий серебряный шар, она взметнулась уверенно, ускорила приближение, нет, замерла в вышине, не тяни так долго долгое дыхание у него дыхание на долгую жизнь, воспарив ввысь, в вышине, увенчанная, сверкая и пламенея, ввысь, в премирном сиянии, ввысь, на лоне эфирном, ввысь, лучи раскидывая ввысь и повсюду, повсюду паря, заполняя все, без конца и без края  рая  рая  рая Ко мне!Саймопольд!Финиш.Приди. Отлично спел. Все захлопали. Она должна. Приди. Ко мне, к нему, к ней и к тебе тоже, ко мне, к нам. Браво! Хлопхлоп. Молодчина, Саймон. Хлохлохлоп. Бис! Хлоплоплоп.Голос как колокольчик. Браво, Саймон! Хлопхлипхлюп. Бис, хлобис, все хлопали, все кричали. Бен Доллард, Лидия Дус, Джордж Лидуэлл, Пэт, Майна Кеннеди, два джентльмена с двумя кружками, Каули, первый джен с кру и бронзовая мисс Дус и золотая мисс Майна.Буяна Бойлана модные рыжие штиблеты ступали, поскрипывая, по полу бара, как выше сказано. Мимо памятников сэру Джону Грэю, Горацио однорукому Нельсону, достопочтенному отцу Теобальду Мэтью позвякивала коляска, как сказано выше только что. По солнцу, по жаре, с нагретым сиденьем. . . .  . Кобылка замедлила, взбираясь на холм возле Ротонды, Ратленд-сквер. Промедленье досадно Бойлану, буяну Бойлану, горячке Бойлану, эк тащится лошаденка.Замерли последние отзвуки аккордов Каули, растворились в воздухе, и стал насыщенней воздух.И Ричи Гулдинг отхлебнул виски, а Блум Леопольд  сидра, а Лидуэлл  пива, а второй джентльмен высказал, что они бы повторили по кружечке, если она не возражает. Мисс Кеннеди, дурную им оказывая услугу, изогнула коралловые губы в улыбке первому, потом второму. Не возражает. В тюрьму на недельку,  сказал Бен Доллард,  на хлеб и на воду. Вот тогда бы вы, Саймон, запели как дрозд в саду.Лионель Саймон, певец, засмеялся. Отец Боб Каули опять заиграл. Майна Кеннеди подавала пиво. Второй джентльмен расплачивался. Том Кернан шествовал к стойке. Лидия, восхищения предмет, восхищалась. Но Блум пел безмолвно.Восхищаясь.Ричи, восхищаясь, разливался насчет дивного голоса этого человека. Ему был памятен один вечер, в давние годы. Такое невозможно забыть. Сай пел Да, мощь и слава, у Неда Лэмберта это было. Боже правый никогда в жизни он не слыхал чтобы брали такие ноты в жизни не слыхал неверная, расстаться лучше нам так чисто так Господи в жизни не слыхал коль нет любви таким потрясающим голосом спросите Лэмберта он скажет вам то же самое.Гулдинг, с румянцем сквозь бледность, повествовал мистеру Блуму, с лицом темней ночи, как Сай Дедал в доме у Неда Лэмберта пел Да, мощь и слава.Он, мистер Блум, слушал, как он, Ричи Гулдинг, повествует ему, Блуму, о вечере, когда он, Ричи, слышал, как он, Сай Дедал, пел Да, мощь и слава в доме у него, Неда Лэмберта.Свояки, родичи. Встречаясь, друг другу не скажем ни слова. Я думаю, тут черная кошка пробежала. Поливает его презрением. И смотри-ка. От этого еще больше им восхищается. О, тот вечер, когда Сай пел. Человеческий голос, две тоненькие шелковые нити, самое удивительное из всего.Горькая жалоба была в том голосе. Теперь спокойней. Как смолкнет, тут и чувствуешь, что услышал. Вибрации. Сейчас воздух смолк.Блум распутал свои сплетенные кисти и рассеянными пальцами подергал упругую струну. Он оттягивал и дергал. Она жужжала и гудела. Пока Гулдинг толковал о постановке голоса у Барраклоу, а Том Кернан, обращаясь в прошлое с неким ретроспективным упорядочением, что-то говорил отцу Каули, который, слушая, импровизировал, который кивал, импровизируя. Пока Большой Бен Доллард говорил с Саймоном Дедалом, закуривающим трубку, который кивал, закуривая, который курил.Моя утрата. Все романсы на эту тему. Еще сильней натянул Блум свою струну. Не жестоко ли это. Люди привяжутся друг к другу, завлекут, заманят друг друга. А потом разрыв. Смерть. Крах. Обухом по башке. Ковсемчертям  чтобтвоегодуху. Жизнь человека. Дигнам. Бр-р, как та крыса шевелила хвостом! Пять шиллингов я пожертвовал.  []. Карканье клирика, его брюхо, как у дохлого пса. Сгинул. Отпели. Забыт. Так вот и я. И в один прекрасный день она с. Оставишь ее  сыт по горло. Сперва пострадает. Похныкает.Большие глаза испанки уставлены в пустоту. Волнистыистыисты  густыустыустые волосы не прич-причесан-ны.Хотя сплошное счастье наводит скуку. Он натягивал все сильней, сильней.Так ты несчастлив в? Трень. Она лопнула.Коляска позвякивала по Дорсет-стрит.Мисс Дус атласную ручку отобрала с видом укоризненным и польщенным. Вы слишком много себе позволяете,  пожурила она,  мы еще недостаточно знакомы.Джордж Лидуэлл заверил ее, что он искренне, он серьезно  однако она не верила.Первый джентльмен заверил Майну, так все и было. Она его спросила, так ли все было. И вторая кружка ее заверила, так. Что так все и было.Мисс Дус, мисс Лидия, не верила  мисс Кеннеди, Майна, не верила  Джордж Лидуэлл, нет  мисс Ду не  первый, первый  джент с кру  верила, нет-нет  нет-нет, мисс Кенн  Лидлидиуэлл  крукруж.Лучше тут написать. На почте все перья обглоданы и поломаны.Лысый Пэт приблизился по знаку его. Перо и чернила. Удалился. И бювар.Удалился. Бювар, промокнуть. Услыхал, глухарь Пэт. Да,  сказал мистер Блум, теребя свернувшуюся струну.  Бесспорно.Несколько строчек, и хватит. Мой подарок. Вся эта итальянская музыка с фиоритурами. Интересно, кто автор. Когда знаешь кто, как-то яснее. Теперь вынимай лист бумаги, конверт  с невозмутимым видом. Это совершенно типично. Коронный номер всей этой оперы,  сказал Гулдинг. Бесспорно,  отвечал Блум.Все это  номера. Числа. Вся музыка, если разобраться. Два помножить на два поделить пополам будет дважды один. Аккорды  это вибрации. Один плюс два плюс шесть будет семь. Можно числами крутить как угодно. Всегда выйдет что-то равно чему-то  симметрия. Симмертия. Смерть. Он и не замечает, что я в трауре. Толстокож, дальше своего брюха не видит. Музматематика.Кажется, будто слышишь нечто возвышенное. А попробуй-ка ей сказать в таком духе: Марта семь помножить на девять минус икс дает тридцать пять тысяч.Как от стенки горох. Так что все дело в звуках.Например, он сейчас играет. Импровизирует. Пока нет слов, это может означать что угодно. Надо вслушиваться как следует. Нелегко. Сперва все отлично  а потом слышишь, будто слегка выпал из темы  потерялся слегка.А уж там посыпались мешки да бочки, через заборы с проволокой, скачка с препятствиями. Главное войти в ритм. Зависит от настроения. Но все-таки слушать всегда приятно. Не считая, конечно, гамм, когда девицы долбят.Целых две по соседству. Для таких бы надо придумать беззвучное пианино. Я для нее купил []. За название. Однажды шел домой ночью, и девушка это играла в медленном темпе, девушка. Где ворота конюшен рядом с Цецилия-стрит. Милли не любит. Странно, ведь мы-то оба.Пэт лысый глухарь принес чернила и плоский бювар. Плоский бювар положил глухарь рядом с чернилами и пером. Тарелку, вилку и нож Пэт взял со стола и отбыл.Этому языку нет равных заявил Бену мистер Дедал. Еще мальчишкой он слышал как они распевали свои баркаролы: Рингабелла, Кроссхейвен, Рингабелла, в этих местах. Гавань в Куинстауне полна итальянских судов.Представляете, Бен, они там разгуливали лунными ночами в этаких невообразимых шляпах. Так стройно сливались голоса. Какая музыка, Бен.Слышал мальчишкой. В ночи над гаванью звучали лунаролы.Терпкую трубку отложив, сложенную щитком ладонь поднес он к своим губам, проворковавшим зов ночной в лунном свете, звучный вблизи, зов издали, отзываясь.По краю свернутого трубкой Фримена скользил Блума глаз, как бы не сглазил, отыскивая, где же я это видел. Каллан, Коулмен, Дигнам Патрик.Эй гей! Эй-гей! Фоусет. Ага! Вот это я и искал.Авось он не наблюдает за мной, а то нюх как у крысы. Он развернул свой Фримен. Теперь не увидит. Не забывай е писать по-гречески. Блум обмакнул, Блу пробормо: дорогой сэр. Дорогой Генри нацарапал: дорогая Мейди. Получил от тебя пись и цве. Тьфу, а куда девал? В каком-то из кар.Соверш невозм. Подчеркни: невозм. Написать сегодня.Скучное дело. Заскучавший Блум легонько побарабанил я просто слегка задумался пальцами по плоскому глухарем доставленному бювару.Пошли дальше.

Ясно? Это и есть та коляска, что резво позвякивала. Мимо мясной лавки Длугача, мимо яркой рекламы Агендат рысила кобылка с вызывающим задом. Отвечаем на объявление?  спросили острые глазки Ричи. Да,  сказал мистер Блум.  Коммивояжер в пределах города. Пустое дело, я думаю.Блу бормо: наилучшие рекомендации. Генри меж тем писал: это меня взволнует. Ты умеешь. Спешу. Генри. Греческое е.

Бронза и роза.Она чудесно, ну просто чудесно провела время. А поглядите, какую красивую ракушку она привезла.Держа легонько, она принесла ему со стойки витой, рогатый, моря звучащий горн, дабы он, стряпчий Джордж Лидуэлл, мог послушать. Слушайте!  повелела она.Под Тома Кернана речи, подогретые джином, аккомпаниатор сплетал медленную мелодию. Подлинный факт. Как Уолтер Бэпти потерял голос. И тут, сэр, гневный супруг хватает его за горло. Вы негодяй , говорит. Но больше уж вам не петь любовных песен . Вот такая история, сэр Том. Боб Каули сплетал. У теноров всегда масса женщ. Каули откинулся назад.Да да, сейчас он услышал, она поднесла ему к самому уху. Слушайте! Он слушал. Замечательно. Она поднесла ее к своему, и в бледном процеженном свете золото контрастом скользнуло. Тоже послушать. Тук.Блум видел через дверь бара, как они подносили к уху раковину. Он слышал, хоть и слабей, то же, что они слышали, себе, а потом другой поднося послушать, слушая плеск волны, громко, беззвучный рев.За бронзой утомленное золото, вблизи, издали, слушали.Ее ухо  еще одна раковина, мочка оттопырена.

Шарики  острова.Правда, замечательно, Так отчетливо. Можно еще. Джордж Лидуэлл подержал ее, шепчущую, послушал,  потом осторожно отложил. О чем напевают волны?  спросил он ее с улыбкой.Чаруя, но не давая ответа, улыбкой моря Лидия Лидуэллу улыбнулась.Тук.Мимо Ларри ОРурка, мимо нашего Ларри, бравого Ларри О, Бойлан колыхался и свернул Бойлан.От покинутой раковины мисс Майна скользнула к ожидающим кружкам. Нет, она была не совсем одинока, лукаво поведала головка мисс Дус мистеру Лидуэллу. Прогулки у моря при луне. Нет, не в одиночестве. А с кем же? С одним очень достойным другом  был достойный ответ.Пальцы Боба Каули снова замелькали в высоких октавах. Право первого иска за домохозяином. Немного бы времени. Длинный Джон. Большой Бен.

Дверь Ратледжа: кр-р, скрип. Нет, это уже шум. А сейчас он менуэт играет из Дон Жуана. Придворные во всяческих туалетах танцуют в покоях замка. А снаружи крестьяне. Нищета.

Да нет, Бен,  вмешался Том Кернан,  лучше Стриженого паренька. На родном наречии. Давайте, Бен,  присоединился к нему мистер Дедал.  О, добрые люди. Давайте, давайте!  поддержали все в один голос.Пойду ка я. Пэт, можно вас. Подойдите. Он подходит, он подходит, он, не мешкая, идет. Ко мне. Сколько с меня? А в какой тональности? Шесть диезов? Фа диез мажор,  подтвердил Бен Доллард.Растопыренные когти Каули упали на черные клавиши нижних октав.Я должен идти, сказал принц Блум принцу Ричи. О, нет, возразил Ричи.Увы, должен. Где-то он раздобыл деньжонок. Теперь пойдет во все тяжкие, пока у него поясницу не схватит. Сколько? Он услывидел губречь. Шиллинг и девять пенсов. Пенни ему. Вот. Нет, оставь два на чай. Глухой, весь в заботах. Может, у него дома семья, жена тужит, пока Пэтти служит.Хи хи-хи-хи. Глухарь служит, она по нем тужит.Но погоди. Послушай. Мрачные аккорды. Угугугрюмые. Низкие. Во мрачной пещере, в недрах земли. Груды руды: глыбы музыки.Голос мрачного времени, нелюбви, земной истомленности, мерно вступил и, скорбный, пришедший издалека, с диких гор, воззвал к добрым людям.Священника он искал, ему хотел молвить слово.Тук.Бен Доллард, бас-бормотон. Старается выразить как может. Уханье необъятного болота  безлунного  безлюдного  бездамного. Еще один, скатившийся вниз. Был ведь когда-то крупным поставщиком для флота. Отлично помню: просмоленные канаты, сигнальные фонари. А потом банкротство на десять тысяч фунтов. Теперь в богадельне Айви. Каморка номер такой-то. Все выпивка довела.Священник дома. Слуга мнимого священника приглашает его войти. Входи.Святой отец. Завитки аккордов.Разоряют людей. Губят им жизнь. А потом пожалуют по каморке, чтоб имел, где подохнуть. Бай-бай. Колыбельная. Спи, наш песик, баю-бай. Спи, собачка, подыхай.Голос, звучащий предостережением, зловещим предостережением, поведал им, как входит юноша в зал пустой, как зловеще там раздаются его шаги, поведал о мрачных покоях, где сидел священник в сутане, готовый выслушать исповедь.Чистая душа. Правда, малость уже свихнулся. Рассчитывает выиграть в Ответах конкурс, разгадка ребусов на названия стихотворений. И мы вручим вам хрустящую банкноту в пять фунтов. Птица сидит на яйцах в гнезде. Он решает, что это Песнь последнего менестреля. Ка черточка тэ, какое это домашнее животное? Эн черточка эн, храбрейший из моряков. Но голос до сих пор прекрасный. И далеко не евнух, с этакой-то своей снастью.Слушай. Блум слушал. Слушал Ричи Гулдинг. И у дверей глухой Пэт, лысый Пэт, очаеванный Пэт слушал.Аккорды зазвучали медленней.Голос раскаяния и горя выводил медленно, красиво, вибрируя. Покаянная борода Бена исповедовалась:   , во имя Господне. Он преклонил колена. Бия себя в грудь, исповедовался он:  [].Опять латынь. Они к ней липнут, как мухи к липучке. Священник со святыми дарами для тех женщин. Другой на кладбище, гробер или гробби, []. Интересно, где та крыса сейчас. Скреблась.Тук.Они слушали, кружки и мисс Кеннеди, Джорджа Лидуэлла выразительные ресницы, и полногрудый атлас, Кернан, Сай.Поющий голос вздыхал, скорбел. Грехи его. С Пасхи он выругался три раза. Чертов убл. Однажды прогулял мессу. Однажды, проходя мимо церкви, забыл помолиться за упокой души матери. Совсем парнишка еще. Стриженый паренек.Бронзоволосая возле пивного насоса, заслушавшись, глаза устремила вдаль. Самозабвенно. Будто и знать не знает, что я на нее. У Молли на это нюх, замечать, когда на нее глядят.Бронзоволосая глаза устремила вдаль, в сторону. Там зеркало. Это у нее, видно, самый эффектный ракурс. Всегда за этим следят. Стук в дверь.Последний штрих к туалету.Кук карре-ку.О чем они думают, когда слушают музыку? Так ловят гремучих змей. Вечер, когда Майкл Ганн устроил нас в ложу. Настройка инструментов. Персидский шах это обожает больше всего. Напоминает ему любимый дом родной. Еще он высморкался в занавес. Может, у них так принято. Тоже музыка. А что собственно плохого. Туруру. Медные, ослы бедные, ревут, задрав раструб.Беззащитные контрабасы с раной в боку. Деревянные  коровье мычание.Раскрытый рояль  крокодилова пасть: зубы музыка таит. Бемоли: Б.Молли.Молли Блум.Она выглядела великолепно. Шафранное платье с низким вырезом, все прелести напоказ. Гвоздичный запах дыхания, когда наклонялась что-то спросить. Я рассказывал, о чем говорит Спиноза в той папиной книжке.Слушала как завороженная. Глаза вот такие. Наклонялась вперед. Субъект на балконе все разглядывал ее сверху вниз в бинокль, так и впивался.Почувствовать красоту музыки  надо послушать дважды. Природы, женщины  с одного взгляда. Бог создал страну, человек  музыку. Метим псу хвост.Философия. Ну и дичь!Все погибли. Все пали в бою. Отец  при осаде Росса, братья  в битве у Гоури. В Вексфорд, мы вексфордские парни, стремился он. Последний в своем роду.Я тоже. Последний в моем роду. Милли со своим студентом. Что ж, видно, сам виноват. Нет сына. Руди. Сейчас уже поздно. А вдруг нет? Вдруг нет?Вдруг еще?В нем не было ненависти.Любовь. Ненависть. Одни слова. Руди. Скоро буду старик.Большой Бен развернул голос в полную силу. Могучий голос, сказал Ричи Гулдинг, у которого румянец боролся с бледностью, Блуму, вскорости старику но в бытность его молодым.Теперь об Ирландии. Его родина для него дороже короля. Дева слушает.Про девятьсот четвертый год не бойтесь говорить. Пора отчаливать.Насмотрелся. Благослови, отче ,  паренек Доллард воскликнул.  Благослови меня ты в путь .Тук.Блум, не получивший благословения в путь, продолжал смотреть. Туалет сногсшибательный  и это на восемнадцать шиллингов в неделю. Из поклонников тянет. Надо глядеть в оба. До чего милы красотки. Над печальными волнами моря. Роман хористки. Были оглашены письма, доказывающие наличие брачного обещания. Своей тепленькой цыпочке пишет ее котишка-плутишка. Смех в зале суда. Генри. Подпись-то не моя. Твое красивое имя.Музыка зазвучала глуше, и мелодия, и слова. Потом ускорила темп. Шорох сутаны, и вместо мнимого священника перед ним офицер. Гвардеец, капитан.Они все это знают наизусть. Обожают пощекотать себя ужасом. Гвардеец-кеп.Тук. Тук.Ужасом и сочувствием охваченная, она слушала, подавшись вперед, чтоб лучше.Чистое личико. Одно из двух: или девушка, или пока только пальцем пробовали. Чистая страничка: пиши на ней. А если нет, что с ними делается?Тоскуют, вянут. Поддерживает в них молодость. Еще как, сами себе дивятся.Смотри ка. Впору поиграть на ней. Подуть губами. Белотелая женщина -живая флейта. Подуть слегка. Громче. Любая женщина три дыры. Так и не поглядел у богини. Они сами хотят и деликатности особой не требуется. Оттого он всех и имеет. В кармане золото, на морде нахальство. Глазами в глаза: песни без слов. Молли и этот мальчуган-шарманщик. Сразу угадала, про что он: обезьянка больна. А может потому что на испанский похоже. Таким манером можно даже зверей понимать. Соломон умел. Природный дар.Чревовещание. Рот у меня закрыт. Думают, у меня в животе. Что?Желаешь? Ты? Я. Хочу. Чтоб. Ты.Гвардеец проклятье ему прохрипел. Налился кровью от ярости, чертов ублюдок. Удачная мысль, юнец, прийти сюда. Жить тебе остается час, Последний твой.Тук. Тук.Пик ужаса. Они чувствуют жалость. Уронить слезу о мучениках. Обо всем, что умирает, стремится, до смерти жаждет умереть. Обо всем, что рождается.Бедная миссис Пьюрфой. Надеюсь, разрешилась уже. Потому что их лона.Влага лона женщины зрачок глядел сквозь ресниц частокол, вслушиваясь, спокойно. Когда она помалкивает, видишь, какие красивые у нее глаза. По той реке. И каждый раз, когда медленно вздымалась атласная волна ее груди (ее вздымающиеся округ), красная роза вздымалась медленно и медленно опускалась. Ее дыхание  в такт сердцу, дыхание это жизнь. И все крохотные крохотные завитки, девичьих волос папоротниковый узор, трепетали в такт.Но взгляни. Уж меркнут звезды. О, роза! Кастилии. Заря. Ха. Лидуэлл.Так это ему, а не. Влюбился. И я так могу? Брось, погляди-ка вокруг нее.Пробки, лужи пены пивной, пустые бутылки.На гладкую рукоять пивного насоса Лидия ручку положила легонько, мягонько, предоставь-ка это моим рукам. Все потеряно в порыве жалости к пареньку. Взад-вперед, взад-вперед: блестящую рукоять (знает про его глаза, мои глаза, ее глаза) большой и указательный пальцы, жалея, гладили: оглаживали, поглаживали, а потом, нежно касаясь, скользнули, так медленно, гладко, вниз, и белый, твердый, прохладный эмалированный кол торчал в их скользящем кольце.Петух потоптать да покукарекать.Тук. Тук. Тук.Я здесь хозяин. Аминь. С яростным скрежетом зубов. Веревка предателям.Аккорды выразили согласие. Печальная история. Но неизбежно было.Смыться, пока не кончилось. Спасибо, это было божественно. Где моя шляпа. Пройти мимо нее. Фримен можно оставить. Письмо со мной. А вдруг она? Нет. Ходить, ходить, ходить. Как Кэшел Бойло Конноро Койло Тисделл Морис Итакдал Фаррелл, Ходи-ии-и-и-ть.Ну я, пожалуй. Уходите? Дпжпрдсвд. Блпднлся. Заблумшая душа. Блум поднялся. Уф. Мыло сзади чувствуется стало липкое. Вспотел, видно: все музыка. Не забыть про лосьон. Ну что же, до встречи. Шляпа-лю. Карточка там. Да.Мимо глухаря в дверях, напрягшего ухо, прошел Блум.У стенки казармы он был казнен. И в Пассидже тело зарыли его. ![]О, он долорес! Голос горестного певца призывал к скорбной молитве.Мимо розы, мимо груди атласной, мимо ласкающей ручки, мимо помоев, пробок, пустых бутылок, раскланиваясь на ходу, позади оставляя глазки и завитки, бронзу и потускневшее золото в тени глубин океанских, проходил Блум, кроткий Блум, одинокий облумок Блум.Тук. Тук. Тук.Молитесь о нем, взмолился бас Долларда. Те, кто мирно внимает.Прошепчите молитву, оброните слезу, добрые люди, честной народ. То был стриженый паренек.Вспугнув стриженого уши развесившего коридорного, уже в коридоре Блум услыхал рев похвал, браво, смачные шлепки по спине, башмаков топот, башмаков всех их, не пареньков. Всеобщий хор требовал выпивки обмыть такое событие. К счастью, я избежал. Ну и ну, Бен,  сказал Саймон Дедал.  Клянусь, вы были на высшем уровне. Нет, выше,  возразил Том-Джин Кернан.  Самое проникновенное исполнение этой баллады, ручаюсь моей душой и честью. Лаблаш,  сказал отец Каули.Бен Доллард, щедрой хвалой осыпанный, радостно раскрасневшийся, грузно прокачучил к стойке на слоновьих ногах, узловатые пальцы прищелкивающие в воздухе кастаньеты.Большой Бенабен Доллард. Боль-шой Бен-Бен, Большой Бен-Бен.П р-рр.Все расчувствовались, Саймон свою растроганность в носа рог протрубил, все смеялись и привели его, Бена Долларда, в самое отличное настроение. Как вы разрумянились,  сказал Джордж Лидуэлл.Мисс Дус поправила свою розу, приготовившись обслужить. Бен [],  промолвил мистер Дедал, хлопнув Бена по жирной лопатке.  Молодец хоть куда, вот только все занимается тайными накоплениями жировых тканей.Пу у-пр-р. Смертоносный жир, Саймон,  пожаловался Бен Доллард.Ричи, черная кошка пробежала, сидел в одиночестве: Гулдинг, Коллис, Уорд. В нерешимости выжидал. Пэт, платы не получивший, тоже.Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук.Мисс Майна Кеннеди приблизила губы к уху кружки номер один. Мистер Доллард,  тихонько они шепнули. Доллард,  шепнула кружка.Номер один поверил: мисс Кенн когда она: что он дол: она дол: номер один.Он прошептал, что он знает эту фамилию. То есть эта фамилия ему знакома. То есть он уже раньше слышал фамилию. Доллард, правда? Да, Доллард.Да, произнесли ее губы уже погромче, мистер Доллард. Он дивно спел эту песню, прошептала Майна. И Последняя роза лета тоже дивная песня. Майне нравилась эта песня. Кружке нравилась песня которая Майне.Последнюю розу лета Доллард покинул Блум почуял внутри вьются ветры.Газы от этого сидра образуются. И крепит. Погоди. Почта возле Рувима Дж., да еще шиллинг восемь пенсов. Покончить с этим. Можно пройти по Грик-стрит. Напрасно я обещал прийти. На воздухе лучше. Музыка. Действует на нервы. Рукоять насоса. Рука, что качает колыбель, правит. Бен Хоут. Что правит миром.Даль. Даль. Даль. Даль.Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук.По набережной зашагал Лионелеопольд, противный Генри с письмецом к Мейди, с прелестями греха с безделушками для Рауля с метим псу хвост шагал Польди.Тук тук слепой продвигался по тротуару, тукая тукалкой, тук за туком.Каули, он себя взвинчивает этим, своего рода опьянение. Лучше на полпути остановиться: пути мужчины к девице. Или вот меломаны. Весь уйдет в слух. Не потерять ни полполовинки писка. Глаза закрыты. Кивают головой в такт. Как свихнулись. Шелохнуться не смей. Думать строго запрещено. И без конца толкуют про эту кухню. Вечные ляляля про свои ноты.Хотя это тоже попытка общения. Неприятно, когда обрывается из-за того, что не знаешь в точ. Орган на Гардинер-стрит. Старому Глинну платили по пятьдесят фунтов в год. Диковато сидеть там одному наверху со всеми этими педалями, клавишами, регистрами. Целыми днями за органом. О чем-то постоянно бубнит, то сам с собой, а то с другим чудаком, который раздувает мехи. Ворчит сердито, потом чертыханье, крик (там видно была прокладка или что-то такое в его ах нет крикнула она не надо), потом вдруг мягкой струйкой уи-и маленькой уи-и маленький тоненький звук как ветерок.Пи и! Маленький ветерок тоненько протянул и-и-и. У Блума внутри-и-и. Так это он?  спросил мистер Дедал, вернувшись со своей трубкой.  Сегодня утром мы вместе были на бедняги Дигнама Помилуй Господи его душу. Кстати, какой-то камертон там на томТук. Тук. Тук. Тук. У его жены раньше был чудный голос. А сейчас как она?  спросил Лидуэлл. Ах, это, верно, настройщик,  объяснила Лидия Саймонлионелю явился дивный,  его позабыл, когда был тут.Он совершенно слепой, сообщила она Джорджу Лидуэллу явился второй. И так изящно играл, просто наслаждение слушать. Изящное сочетание: бронзалид майназлато. А ну, ори, сколько!  орал Бен Доллард, наливая.  Столько? Будет!  вопил отец Каули.Пууррр.Чувствую, мне явно хочетсяТук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Вполне,  промолвил мистер Дедал, пристально разглядывая безголовую сардинку.Под колпаком, прикрывавшим сандвичи, на катафалке из хлеба она покоилась, последняя и единственная, одинокая и последняя сардинка лета.Блум одинок. Вполне,  продолжал он разглядывать.  В нижнем регистре. Высшего качества.Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук. Тук.Блум миновал швейное заведение Барри. Хорошо бы я смог. Обождать малость. Сейчас бы мне это чудотворное средство. Двадцать четыре законника тут под одной крышей. Кляузы. Любите друг друга. Горы гербовой бумаги.Господа Чистильщик и Карманов имеют судейские полномочия. Гулдинг, Коллис, Уорд.А взять, скажем, того малого, что бухает в большой барабан. Оркестр Микки Руни  призванье его. Интересно, как он это открыл. Сидел дома у себя в кресле, уплетал свинину с капустой. Репетирует свою партию. Бум.Барабум. То-то его жене веселье. Ослиные шкуры. Пока жив, нахлестывают, когда издохнет, колотят. Бум. Бубубух. Прямо этот, как его там, кишмиш, то есть, верней, кисмет. Рок.Тук. Тук. Слепой юноша, постукивающий тросточкой, дошел, постуктукту кивая, до витрин Дэли, в которых русалка, по плечам распустив струящиеся русые пряди (но он не мог видеть их), выпускала кольцами дым русалки (слепой не мог), курите русалку, это легчайшие сигареты.Инструменты. Стебелек травы, ее ладони раковиной, и подуть. Даже на гребенке с папиросной бумагой, и то можно исполнить мотивчик. Молли на Ломбард-стрит, в сорочке, с распущенными волосами. Я думаю, в любом ремесле какая-нибудь своя, разве нет? У охотников рог. Рогоносцы.Зачесалось. У тебя? .  . Волынка у пастухов. Свисток полисмена. Замки-ключи продаю! Трубы чищу! Четыре утра, все спокойно!Спите! Все потеряно. Барабан? Барабум. Погоди, еще знаю. Главный крикун в городе, наш главный бам барабум инспектор. Длинный Джон. Мертвого разбудит. Бум. Дигнам. Бедняга []. Бум.Тоже музыка, хотя, конечно, тут почти одно бум бум бум, то, что называют  []. Но кое-что можно уловить. Мы шагаем все вперед, все вперед. Бум.Нет, в самом деле, мне надо. Пу-у-у. Если б я на банкете так. Вопрос обычаев, вот и все. Шах персидский. Прошепчите молитву, уроните слезу.Все таки он был простачок, не разглядеть что это гвардеец кеп. Весь закутан. Интересно, кто же это был, на кладбище, в коричневом макинто. А, уличная шлюха!Потасканная шлюха в черной плоской соломенной шляпке набекрень, остекленелая в свете дня, скользила безжизненно по набережной навстречу мистеру Блуму. Когда явился дивный облик. О, да. Я сегодня так одинок. В дождливую ночь, в переулке. Зачесалось. У него. Как завидел. Он ее. А тут не ее места. Что она? Надеюсь, она. Эй, сударь! Вам не надо что-нибудь пости. Видела Молли. Засекла меня. С тобой была полная дама в коричневом костюме. У меня сразу весь пыл пропал. Назначали свидание зная что никогда разве что иногда. Так много риска, уж очень близко любимый дом родной.Заметила меня или нет? При дневном свете жуткое пугало. Лицо как из воска.Черти бы ее взяли! Ну зачем так, и ей надо жить, как всякому. Отвернись, и все.В витрине антикварной лавки Лионеля Маркса надменный Генри Лионель Леопольд дорогой Генри Флауэр сосредоточенно мистер Леопольд Блум обозревал облупленные канделябры и фисгармонию с ветхими в червоточинах мехами. Цена бросовая: шесть шиллингов. Можно бы научиться играть.Дешевка. Пускай она пройдет. Конечно, все дорого, если тебе не требуется.Это и называется хороший торговец. То заставит купить, что желает сбыть.Такой вот мне продал шведскую бритву, которой меня побрил. Хотел еще взять за то, что он ее наточил. Ну, прошла. Шесть шиллингов.От сидра, а может, и от бургонского.Близ бронзы из близи близ злата из дали звонкими бокалами чокнулись они все, сверкая отважно взорами, перед бронзовой Лидии искусительной розой, последней розою лета, розой Кастилии. Первый Лид, Де, Кау, Кер, Долл пятый: Лидуэлл, Сай Дедал, Боб Каули, Кернан и Большой Бен Доллард.Тук. Входит юноша в зал Ормонда пустой.Блум смотрел на портрет отважного героя в витрине Лионеля Маркса.Последние слова Роберта Эммета. Семь последних слов. Мейербера. Честные граждане, как и ты. Вот-вот, Бен. Бокал твой поднимут с нами.Они подняли.Динь. Дон.Ток. Незрячий юноша стоял на пороге. Он не видел бронзы: Не видел злата. Ни Бена ни Боба ни Тома ни Сая ни Джорджа ни кружек ни Ричи ни Пэта. Хи-хи-хи-хи. Не видел ни зги.Волноблум, сальноблум смотрел на последние слова.

Оборачиваюсь, чтобы покрыть его как следует, и тут вижу, кто ж это топает по Стони-баттер, не иначе Джо Хайнс. Ха, никак Джо,  говорю.  Как живешь-дышишь? Видал, мне этот рассукин трубочист чуть-чуть глаз не высадил? Сажа к счастью,  это он мне.  А что это за старый мудила, с которым ты тут? Папаша Трои,  говорю,  в полиции служил раньше. Я вот думаю, может, мне привлечь этого очумелого за то, что он создает помехи движению своими метлами да лестницами. А чего тебя занесло в эти края?  он мне. Так,  говорю,  ерунда. Тут один жулик, бестия, за гарнизонной часовней живет, на углу Чикен-лейн  папаша Трои как раз мне кой-чего шепчет насчет него  наплел, будто у него богатая ферма в графстве Даун, и под этим видом нагреб чертову пропасть чаю и сахару, как бы в рассрочку по три шиллинга в неделю, у одного плюгавого коротышки по прозванию Моше Герцог, вон там, около Хейтсбери-стрит. Обрезанный!  замечает Джо. Точно,  говорю.  Этак малость с верхушки. Лудильщик по фамилии Герати. Две недели за ним гоняюсь и не могу вытрясти ни пенса. Так это и есть твой промысел?  Джо смекает. Точно,  говорю.  Как пали сильные[]! Взыскание злостных и оспариваемых долгов. Но уж этот  самый отпетый бандюга, какого свет видывал, рожа вся в оспинах, хоть дождь в нее собирай. Передайте ему, говорит, чтобы он остерегся, говорит, и дважды бы остерегся, вас еще сюда посылать, а если пошлет, то я, говорит, его привлеку к суду за торговлю без патента, пусть так и знает . А сам за его счет так набил брюхо, что, гляди, лопнет. Я со смеху сдох, как тот еврейчик на себе волосы рвал. Он зе пивает моего цаю. И он зе кусает моего сахару. Таки цего зе он не отдавает мне мои деньги?

Ты у нас как, строго непьющий?  Джо спрашивает. Промеж двумя рюмками в рот ни капли,  говорю. Тогда, может, навестим друга жаждущих?  снова Джо. Какого бы?  говорю.  Может, уж он у Убогого Джона с психами[], спятил малость, бедняга. От собственного зелья?  это Джо.Вот вот, -говорю.  Виски с содовой ударило в голову. Заглянем к Барни Кирнану,  это Джо.  Мне бы надо повидать Гражданина. Идет, давай к душке Барни,  говорю.  А чего завлекательного на свете слышно? Ничем таким и не пахнет,  это Джо.  Я вот на заседании был в Городском гербе. Это еще о чем?  говорю. Скотопромышленники волнуются насчет ящура,  говорит Джо.  Хочу об этом донести Гражданину суровую правду.И таким манером, болтая о том о сем, огибаем мы с ним казармы Линенхолл и бредем задами мимо суда. Славный он малый, этот Джо, когда у него в кармане звенит, только голову на отсечение, что такого с ним не бывает.Да, думаю, не вышло у меня проучить гнусного пройдоху Герати. Грабит средь бела дня. За торговлю без патента, чего придумал.В стране прекрасной Инисфайл один есть край[]. То дивный край, земля святого Мичена. Там высится сторожевая башня, всем путникам видна издалека. Могучие покойники там спят, как бы во сне живые пребывая, прославленные воины, князья. Отрадно там журчанье вод, привольных и рыбообильных, где резвятся маслюк и пикша, лиманда и палтус, камбала обыкновенная и калкановая, плотва, сайда и тинда, резвится без разбору всяческое рыбье простонародье, резвятся и прочие обитатели водного царства, числа коих никому не исчислить. Под дуновеньем ласкающих зефиров с запада и с востока могучие деревья колышут свое первосортное лиственное убранство, кедры ливанстии и благовонные сикоморы, платан вознесшийся и целительный евкалипт, и прочие украшения древесного мира, коими земля эта щедро наделена. Там прелестные девы, усевшись у подножия прелестных дерев, напевают прелестнейшие мелодии, забавляясь всяческими прелестными вещицами, как то золотыми слитками и серебряными рыбками, бочками сельди и полными неводами угрей, корзинами мальков трески и лосося, багряными дарами моря и шаловливыми букашками. И славные рыцари стремятся со всех концов искать их взаимности, от Эбланы до Сливмарги, несравненные принцы из непокоренного Манстера и Коннахта праведного, с шелковых равнин Ленстера, из страны Круахана и из Армы великолепного и из благородного округа Бойл, принцы, королевские сыновья.И высится там роскошный дворец, хрустальный купол которого, сияющий тысячами огней, отовсюду заметен морякам, что бороздят просторы морей в ладьях, нарочно для этого построенных, и стекаются туда все стада и скот тучный и первые плоды той земли, и ОКоннелл Фицсаймон взимает с них дань, вождь и потомок вождей. На исполинских колесницах туда подвозят плоды полей, мешки капусты, полные отборных кочнов простой и цветной и брюссельской, и капусты кольраби, вороха шпината, консервированные ананасы, рангунские бобы, горы помидоров, связки фиг, груды брюквы, корзины грибов, кабачки, репу, вику, ячмень, и округлые картофелины, и с радужным отливом луковицы, сии перлы земли, и красные зеленые желтые смуглые розовые сладкие крупные кислые зрелые покрытые пушком яблоки и лукошки земляники и сита крыжовника, сочного и мохнатого, и земляники, достойной принцев, и малины прямо с куста. Пускай он остережется, говорит, и дважды остережется. А ну-ка, вылезай сюда, Герати, ты, отпетый бандюга с большой дороги!И туда же устремляются бесчисленные стада племенных овец и могучих баранов с бубенцами, и ягнят, и ярочек, впервые остриженных, и серых гусей, и молодых бычков, и запаленных кобыл, комолых телят, мериносов, овец на откорм, стельных коров от Каффа, отбракованных недомерков, свиноматок и беконных свиней и самых отборных свиней всех прочих разнообразнейших разновидностей свиного рода, телочек из графства Энгус и племенных бычков с безупречной родословной, мясных быков и удойных коров-рекордисток; и никогда там не молкнут топот и гогот, ржанье и блеянье, мычанье и рев и хрюканье и чавканье свиных, овечьих, коровьих орд, пришедших тяжкою поступью с бескрайних пастбищ Ласка и Раша и Каррикмайнза с пойменных лугов Томонда и неприступных хребтов Макгилликадди-Рикс, с берегов величавого глубоководного Шаннона и с приветливых склонов страны рода Кир, вымена их набухли от преизбытка молока, и там же громоздятся бочонки и кадки масла, головы сыру, бараньи туши, меры и меры зерна, сотни и тысячи яиц, всевозможных размеров, продолговатой формы, цвета агата и мела.Стало быть, заворачиваем к Барни Кирнану, и там, как полагается, в углу Гражданин, в живой беседе с самим собой, этот его паршивый пес, Гарриоун, при нем, и ждут, когда и чего им перепало бы насчет выпить. Вот он,  говорю,  в своей берлоге, с кружкой-подружкой, над кипой бумаг, трудясь ради великого дела.Тут окаянный пес так зарычал, что поджилки все затряслись. Благое дело для общества, если бы кто его наконец придавил. Мне рассказали, он тут однажды в лоск изодрал штаны полисмену, который пришел с повесткой насчет патента. Стой, кто идет,  это он. Спокойно, Гражданин,  Джо ему.  Тут свои. Следовать к месту сбора,  он на это.И потом трет глаз ладонью и спрашивает: Каково ваше мнение о сложившейся обстановке?Играет патриота-боевика, Рори, засевшего в горах[]. Но тут, чтоб я лопнул, Джо был на высоте. Я полагаю, акции поднимаются,  говорит он, поглаживая себя по ширинке.И тут, чтоб я лопнул, Гражданин трахает себя по коленке и орет: Войны за границей, вот что всему причина!А Джо на это, колупаясь большим пальцем в кармане: Все русские, так и рвутся тиранить[]. Слушай,  это уж я,  ты кончай зубоскалить, Джо. У меня жажда такая, что за полкроны не продал бы.Джо тогда говорит: Назови марку, Гражданин. Вино нашей родины,  тот ему. Ну, а ты?  это мне Джо. Присоединяюсь к предыдущему оратору,  говорю. Значит, три кружки, Терри,  говорит Джо.  А как здоровьишко, Гражданин? В лучшем виде, радость моя,  тот ему.  Ну как, Гарри? Наша возьмет?У у!И хватает своего шелудивого за шкирку, да так, что из того, еще бы самую малость, и дух вон.Фигура, сидевшая на гигантском валуне у подножия круглой башни, являла собою широкоплечего крутогрудого мощночленного смеловзорого рыжеволосого густовеснушчатого косматобородого большеротого широконосого длинноголового низкоголосого голоколенного стальнопалого власоногого багроволицего мускулисторукого героя. В плечах он был нескольких косых саженей, а колени его, подобные горным утесам, как и все остальное тело, видное глазу, густо покрыты были колючею рыжеватой порослью, цветом и жесткостью походившей на дикий терн ( ). Ноздри с широчайшими раскрыльями, откуда торчали пучки волос того же рыжеватого цвета, были столь дивно поместительны, что в их сумрачной мгле полевой жаворонок без труда свил бы себе гнездо. Глаза его, в которых слеза и улыбка[] вечно оспаривали первенство, превосходили размерами отборный кочан капусты. Мощная струя горячего пара размеренно исторгалась из его бездонной груди, и столь же ритмически могучие звучные удары его исполинского сердца громоподобными раскатами сотрясали почву, заставляя содрогаться до самых вершин башню, что вознеслась высоко, и стены пещеры, вознесшиеся еще выше.На нем было длинное одеяние без рукавов, из свежесодранной бычьей шкуры, свободно ниспадавшее до колен, словно килт, и перехваченное в поясе кушаком из стеблей тростника и соломы. Под этим одеянием имелись штаны из оленьей кожи, грубо сшитые жилами. Нижние конечности его защищали высокие болбриггенские гетры, крашенные пурпурным лишайником, а стопы были обуты в башмаки дубленой коровьей кожи, зашнурованные трахеей того же животного.На поясе подвешены были морские камешки, побрякивавшие при каждом движении его устрашающей фигуры; на них грубо, но с поразительным мастерством были вырезаны изображения покровителей кланов, древних героев и героинь Ирландии, Кухулина[], Конна Ста Битв, Ниалла Девяти Заложников, Брайена Кинкорского, Малахии Великого, Арта Макморра, Шейна ОНила, отца Джона Мэрфи, Оуэна Роу, Патрика Сарсфилда, Рыжего Хью ОДоннелла, Рыжего Джима Макдермотта, Соггарта Оуэна ОГрони, Майкла Двайера, Френси Хиггинса, Генри Джоя Маккракена, Голиафа, Горацио Уитли, Томаса Коннефа, Пег Уоффингтон, Деревенского Кузнеца, Ночного Капитана, Капитана Бойкота, Данте Алигьери, Христофора Колумба, св.Ферсы., св.Брендана, маршала Макмагона, Карла Великого, Теобальда Вулфа Тона, Матери Маккавеев, Последнего из Могикан, Розы Кастилии, Настоящего Голуэйца, Человека, Сорвавшего Банк в Монте-Карло, Защитника Ворот, Женщины, Которая Не Решилась, Бенджамина Франклина, Наполеона Бонапарта, Джона Л.Салливена, Клеопатры, Саворнин Дилиш[], Юлия Цезаря, Парацельса, сэра Томаса Липтона, Вильгельма Телля, Микеланджело Хейса, Магомета, Ламмермурской Невесты, Петра Отшельника, Петра Обманщика, Смуглой Розалин, Патрика В.Шекспира, Брайена Конфуция, Морга Гутенберга, Патрицио Веласкеса, Капитана Немо, Тристана и Изольды, первого Принца Уэльского, Томаса Кука и Сына, Бравого Парня Солдата, Аррана-Пог[], Дика Терпина, Людвига Бетховена, Коллин Бон[], Косолапого Хили, Энгуса Раба Божия, Доллимаунта, проспекта Сидни, мыса Хоут, Валентина Грейтрейкса, Адама и Евы, Артура Уэлсли, босса Крокера, Геродота, Мальчика с пальчик, Будды Гаутамы, леди Годивы, Лилии Килларни, Бейлора Дурной Глаз, царицы Савской, Экки Нэгла, Джо Нэгла, Алессандро Вольты, Джереми ОДонована Россы, Дона Филипа ОСалливена Бира. Подле него покоилось заостренное копье из тесаного гранита, а у самых ног его прикорнул свирепый зверь собачьих кровей, чье прерывистое дыхание указывало на то, что зверь погружен в беспокойный сон,  догадка, находившая подтверждение в хриплых рыках и диких вздрагиваньях, которые хозяин время от времени укрощал успокоительными ударами мощной палицы, грубо выделанной из палеолитического камня.Стало быть, Терри приносит три пинты, а Джо еще все стоит, и тут, братцы мои, я чуть на месте не помер, когда вижу, он вынимает из кармана гинею. Не верите  могу побожиться. Натуральный кругленький соверен. Откуда этот, там еще много таких,  говорит. Никак церковную кружку уворовал?  я ему. Праведным трудом,  отвечает.  Это мне благоразумный субъект намекнул. Я его видел перед тем, как тебя встретить,  говорю.  Он шлялся по Пилл-лейн да по Грик-стрит, пялил свой рыбий глаз на рыбьи кишки.Кто странствует по землям Мичена, облачен в черный панцирь? ОБлум, сын Рори  то он. Неведом страх сыну Рори, и благоразумна душа его. Для старухи с Принс-стрит,  говорит Гражданин,  для субсидируемой газетенки[]. Блюдут соглашение в Палате. А поглядите на это чертово барахло, это он говорит. Нет, вы поглядите, говорит. Айриш индепендент, как вам нравится, независимая ирландская газета, которую Парнелл для того основал, чтобы она служила рабочему люду. А вы только послушайте список рождений и смертей в этой, с вашего позволения, ирландской для ирландцев газете, и то же самое свадьбы.И начинает громко зачитывать: Гордон[], Барнфилд-Креснт, Эксетер; Редмейн, Иффли, Сент-Энн-он-Си: супруга Вильяма Т.Редмейна родила сына. Как это вам, а? Райт и Флинт, Винсент и Джиллет, с Ротой Мэрион, дочерью Розы и покойного Джорджа Альфреда Джиллета, Клафам-роуд, , Стокуэлл, Плейвуд и Рисдейл, Сент-Джуд, Кенсингтон, венчание совершено высокопреподобным доктором Форрестом, настоятелем Вустерского собора. А? Некрологи. Бристоу, Уайтхолл-лейн, Лондон; Кэрр, Стоук Ньюингтон, от гастрита и болезни сердца; Триппер Этого парня я знаю,  говорит Джо,  по горькому опыту. Триппер, Мот-хаус, Чепстоу.

Как это все подходит для национальной прессы, а, хрен моржовый? И что нам все это говорит про Мартина Мэрфи, рассукина политикана из Бантри? Да ладно,  говорит Джо, пододвигая нам кружки.  Порадуемся, что они нас опередили. Ты лучше хлебни-ка, Гражданин. Не премину,  отвечает тот, достопочтеннейший муж. Ну, будем, Джо,  говорю.  Поминки объявляю открытыми.Ух! Это да! Нет слов! Я так без нее страдал, без этой вот пинты. И заявляю официально, я чуял, как она, родимая, прошла в самое недро брюха и сделала вот так: буль!Но взгляните! едва они пригубили свои чаши радости, как стремительно влетел к ним божественный посланец, сияющий, словно око небес, пригожий собою юноша, за коим следовал гордый старец с благородной осанкой, несущий священные свитки закона, и с ним супруга его, особа с безупречною родословной, лучшее украшение своего рода.Малыш Олф Берген влетает в двери и скрывается в задней комнатушке у Барни, весь со смеху вот-вот готов лопнуть. А я смотрю, кто ж это там, я было не заметил, пьяный храпит в углу, отрешившись от мира, не иначе Боб Дорен. До меня никак не доходит, что приключилось, а Олф все делает какие-то знаки из дверей. И тут плетется, угадайте-ка, братцы, кто, этот болван двинутый, Дэнис Брин, в банных шлепанцах и с двумя бля пухлыми томами под мышкой, а за ним жена поспешает, несчастная убогая баба, как моська семенит за ним по пятам. А Олф, гляжу, совсем подыхает со смеху. Любуйтесь,  говорит.  Это Брин наш. Кто-то ему, понимаешь, прислал открытку, а в той открытке стоит: ку-ку! И вот он теперь таскается по всему Дублину, желает вчи чиИ давится аж от хохота. Чичего?  говорю. Иск желает вчинить,  объясняет он.  Всего-то на десять тысяч фунтов! Ни хрена себе!  говорю.Паршивая псина, зачуяв новенького, снова издает такой рык, что у всякого душа в пятки, но тут Гражданин отпустил ей хорошего пинка меж ребер.    [],  говорит Олф. Так, значит, кто это?  Джо спрашивает. Брин,  объясняет Олф.  Он был у Джона Генри Ментона, потом от него поплелся к Коллису и Уорду, а потом его встретил Том Рочфорд и послал ради смеха к главному инспектору полиции. Мать честная, я ржал до колик. К.к.:ку ку. Ну, долговязый ему выдал теплый прием, еще скажи спасибо, не посадил. И вот сейчас этот псих тащится на Грин-стрит, хочет детектива найти. А когда наконец Длинный Джон повесит этого молодца в Маунтджой[]?  Джо спрашивает. Берген,  мычит тут Боб Дорен, просыпаясь.  Ты кто, Олф Берген? Так точно,  говорит Олф.  Повесит? Погодите, я вам чего покажу. Эй, Терри, подай-ка сюда одну. Нет, ну и болван, ну и олух! Десять тысяч фунтов. Жаль, вы не видели, как Длинный Джон на него воззрился. Ку-куИ опять его в хохот. Ты это над кем смеешься?  хрипит Боб Дорен.  Ты кто, Берген? Терри, давай поживей, старик,  просит Олф.Теренций ОРайен[], вняв слову его, в тот же миг ему подал хрустальную чашу, до краев полную пенистым темным элем, который варили издавна в божественных своих чанах благородные близнецы-братья Пивайви и Пивардилон, хитроумные, подобно сыновьям Леды бессмертной[]. Ибо сбирают они сочные плоды хмеля и ссыпают, просеивают, толкут и варят их, и примешивают к ним терпкие соки и ставят сусло на священный огонь, денно и нощно не оставляя своих трудов, хитроумные братья, властители больших чанов.И ты, о рыцарственный Теренций, как отроду привыкший к обхожденью[], поднес ему амброзии подобный напиток, хрустальную чашу предложил ты ему, жаждущему, рыцарственной душе, прекрасному как сами бессмертные.Но он, юный вождь ОБергенов, не мог и помыслить, чтобы другой превзошел его в великодушных деяньях, и посему щедрым жестом ему он подал обол из бесценной бронзы. Искусною рукою чеканщика был выбит на нем величавый лик королевы, происходившей из дома Брунсвик, Виктории именем, Ее Августейшего Величества, милостью Божией Соединенного Королевства Великобритании и Ирландии и британских заморских владений королевы, защитницы веры, императрицы Индии, той, что царствовала над несметными покоренными народами и была им любезна, ибо узнали и возлюбили ее в краях, где восходит солнце и где заходит, бледнокожие и темнокожие, краснокожие и эфиопы. Этот рассукин фармазон,  ворчит Гражданин,  чего он там рыскает взад и вперед снаружи? Какой-такой?  Джо спрашивает. Вот она,  говорит Олф, выуживая монетку.  Вы, значит, о повешении.Так я вам покажу сейчас, чего вы сроду не видели. Письма того, кто вешает.Вот, глядите.И вытаскивает из кармана целую пачку замусоленных писем и конвертов. Разыгрываешь нас?  говорю. Честное благородное,  это он.  Нате, сами читайте.Ну, Джо берет письма. Ты это над кем смеешься?  рычит Боб Дорен.Чую, как бы не вышло заварушки. Боб, он с хорошей придурью, когда налакается, так что я говорю спокойно, чтобы отвлечь: А как там у Вилли Мерри дела, Олф[]? Не знаю,  он мне.  Я его встретил только что на Кейпл-стрит, с Падди Дигнамом. Но мне бежать надо было Чего-чего?  Джо тут оторвался от писем.  С кем встретил? С Дигнамом,  повторяет Олф. Это который Падди?  Джо спрашивает. Ну да,  говорит Олф.  А что такое? Да ты разве не знаешь, что он помер?  это Джо. Падди Дигнам помер?  это Олф. Вот именно,  Джо ему. Да пару минут назад я его видел собственными глазами,  говорит Олф,  клянусь, вот как сейчас вас вижу. Это кто помер?  Боб Дорен спрашивает. Ты, стало быть, видел его призрак,  говорит Джо.  С нами крестная сила. Как-как?  бормочет Олф.  Господи Боже, да всего пару Как это?и с ним Вилли Мерри, а возле них еще этот, как его звать-то Да как же это? Дигнам умер? Чего про Дигнама?  это снова Боб Дорен.  А ну, кто тут про Умер!  говорит Олф.  Да он не больше умер, чем ты. Уж не знаю,  Джо говорит.  Но только сегодня утром совершили такую вольность, похоронили его[]. Как, Падди?  говорит Олф. Его самого,  отвечает Джо.  Исполнил закон природы, помилуй Господи его душу. Господи Иисусе!  говорит Олф.Ей ей, парень был, что называется, убийственно ошарашен.Во тьме ощущалось, как вибрировали руки духа, и когда моление по тантрическому обряду было устремлено в надлежащую область, сделалось постепенно видимым слабое, но все нарастающее свечение рубинового оттенка[].В своем явлении эфирный двойник обретал подобие жизни, в особенности за счет импульсов витальной энергии, доставляемых аурой головы и лица.Общение происходило посредством гипофизной железы, а также лучей оранжево-пламенного и алого цвета, исходивших из сакральной области и солнечного сплетения. Когда к нему обратились, назвав его именем, которое он носил в земной жизни, и спросили о его пребывании в духовных мирах, то он сообщил, что в настоящее время проходит путь возвращения, пралайю, однако первоначально находится во власти неких кровожадных сущностей на низших астральных планах. В ответ на вопрос о своих первых ощущениях по прохождении великого порога запредельных миров он сообщил, что прежде видел как бы сквозь тусклое стекло, однако переступившим порог открываются высочайшие возможности атмического развития. Будучи спрошен о том, напоминает ли жизнь там наше земное существование, он сообщил, что, как слышал он от существ на более высоких ступенях в духовном мире, их обиталища наделены всеми самыми современными домашними удобствами, как то талафонтра, лифтра, сортиртра и атапалентра, а посвященные самых высших ступеней купаются в чистейших и бесконечнейших наслаждениях. Когда же он испросил кварту топленого молока, то указанное было принесено и доставило явное облегчение. Затем справились, не желает ли он что-либо передать живущим, и он призвал всех, кто еще пребывает на ложной стороне, кто поглощен Майей, вступить на путь истины, ибо в кругах деванических стало известно, что Марс и Юпитер находятся в противостоянии, угрожая восточному дому, где властвует овен. Тогда осведомились, нет ли каких особенных пожеланий со стороны усопших, и ответ был: Мы шлем вам привет, наши земные друзья, еще пребывающие во плоти. Следите, чтобы К.К. не заходил слишком далеко . Установлено было, что инициалы относятся к мистеру Корнелиусу Келлехеру, управляющему известной похоронной конторой Г.Дж.ОНила и другу усопшего, лично ведавшему устройством и церемонией погребения. Перед тем как удалиться, он попросил также передать его любимому сыну Пэтси, что второй ботинок, который тот разыскивал, лежит в настоящее время под комодом в угловой комнате, и всю пару следует отнести к Коллену, причем чинить лишь подметки, поскольку каблуки вполне в целости. Он добавил, что это тяжко тревожило покой его духа в ином мире, и убедительно просил об исполнении своей просьбы.Были даны заверения в том, что все необходимое будет сделано, и, как можно было заметить, это принесло удовлетворение.Он оставил жилища смертных, ОДигнам, солнце нашего утра. Легким его стопам лесных уж не попирать папоротников, о, Патрик с челом сияющим.Оплачь его, Банба[], своими ветрами и ты, Океан, ураганами своими. Вон он опять там,  говорит Гражданин, выглядывая в окно. Кто?  говорю. Да Блум,  отвечает он.  Как постовой мотается взад-вперед, вот уже минут десять.И тут, ей-пра, я заметил, как его физия зыркнула внутрь и, шасть, тут же опять исчезла.А малыша Олфа как будто по башке треснули. Не может в себя прийти. Боже милостивый!  говорит.  Я же поклясться могу, что это он был.И тут снова Боб Дорен, шапка на затылке, он просто жуткий громила делается, когда на него найдет: А ну-ка, кто тут сказал Боже милостивый? Пердон, сударь,  говорит Олф. Так, по-твоему, это милость,  рявкает Боб,  что он у нас отнял нашего бедного Вилли Дигнама? Ну, понимаешь,  юлит Олф, пытаясь спустить на тормозах,  сейчас его уже ничто не тревожит.Но тут Боб как гаркнет: Вонючий мерзавец, вот он кто, раз он отнял у нас нашего бедного Вилли Дигнама!Терри выходит и моргает ему, чтоб он потише, мол, в ихнем приличном заведении таких разговоров не полагается. И тогда Боб Дорен, вот вам сущая правда, начинает проливать горькую слезу над судьбой Падди Дигнама. Прекраснейший человек был,  ноет Боб, всхлипывая,  чистейшая, прекраснейшая душа.В глазах твоих слеза чертовски близко[]. И все несет свой собачий бред.Ступал бы лучше к своей сучонке, на которой его женили[], к блажной этой Муни, дочке пристава из какого-то захолустья. Мамаша держала меблирашки на Хардвик-стрит, так она там вечно шлялась по лестницам, мне Бэнтам Лайонс рассказывал, бывало, выйдет часа в два ночи в чем мать родила и так стоит, гляди и приходи кто угодно, доступ для всех на равных условиях. Честнейший и благороднейший,  Боб все ноет.  И вот он скончался, наш бедный Вилли, то есть бедный наш Падди Дигнам.В глубокой скорби, с тяжким бременем на душе оплакивал он угасший светоч небес.Тут старина Гарриоун опять заворчал на Блума, что все крутился у двери. Да заходите смелей, не съест,  говорит Гражданин.Блум пробирается, косясь на пса, и спрашивает у Терри, не был ли тут Мартин Каннингем. Ах ты, Господь Мак-Кеун!  говорит Джо, еще все за письмами.  Послушайте-ка вот это, хотите?И начинает зачитывать.Ливерпуль, Хантер-стрит,  Начальнику дублинской полиции, Дублин.Глубокожаемый Сэр осмелюсь вам предложить свои услуги насчет помянутого деликатного дела как я повесил Джо Ганна в Бутлской тюрьме  февраля  года и еще повесил  Покажи, покажи-ка, Джо,  говорю. рядового Артура Чейса за убивство Джесси Тильзит в Пентонвильской тюрьме и еще был помощником когда  Господи,  говорю. . Биллингтон казнил злодея убивца Тода Смита Тут Гражданин хотел было у него цапнуть письмо. Потерпи,  это Джо ему,  а еще имею самоличный спосоп накидки петли так чтоб уже не выпутался и остаюсь со всей надеждой на вашу милость а также моя цена пять гиней, Х.Рамболд, Цирюльник . Этот цирюльник заслужил хороший пиндюльник,  говорит Гражданин. Грязная поганая тварь,  Джо плюется.  На,  говорит,  Олф, забери-ка их с глаз долой. Приветствую,  говорит,  Блум, чего выпьете?Ну, тут они пошли препираться, Блум, я, мол, не хочу да я не могу да вы не сочтите за оскорбление и так далее, а в конце концов говорит, ладно, тогда я, пожалуй, возьму сигару. Ей-ей, благоразумный субъект, ничего не скажешь. Дай-ка нам, Терри, самую лучшую из твоих вонючек,  говорит Джо.Олф между тем толкует, как один такой малый прислал открытку с соболезнованиями и с черной каймой вокруг. Все эти,  говорит,  цирюльники из черных краев[], они за пять фунтов плюс дорожные расходы готовы отца родного повесить.И начинает рассказывать, как там при этом двое стоят внизу и тянут за ноги, когда повиснет, чтобы задохся как следует, а потом они режут веревку на кусочки и продают, выручают по нескольку шиллингов с головы.В темных краях обитают они, мстительные рыцари бритвы. Держат они наготове свое смертоносное вервие и неумолимо препровождают в Эреб[] всякого, кто бы ни совершил кровавое злодеяние, ибо отнюдь не буду терпеть того, так говорит Господь.Тут они начали рассуждать насчет смертной казни и конечно Блум давай выступать со всякими почему да отчего со всей хренопруденцией этого дела а пес что-то все время его обнюхивает мне говорили от этих жидов какой-то особый запах который собаки чуют и рассусоливает про средство устрашения и прочее в этом духе. А я знаю одну штуку, на которую не действует устрашение,  это Олф. Это какая же?  Джо спрашивает. Член того бедняги, которого вешают,  отвечает Олф. Правда, что ли?  это Джо. Чистейшая правда,  Олф ему.  Я сам слышал от главного надзирателя, который был в Килмаинхеме[], когда там вешали Джо Брэди, непобедимого. Он говорит, когда они сняли его с веревки, то у него так и торчал прямо им в нос, как свечка. Страсть господствует и в смерти[], кто-то там говорил,  это Джо. Наука это все объясняет,  говорит Блум.  Это естественный феномен, понимаете ли, поскольку за счетИ начинает сыпать слова, от которых язык сломаешь, про феномены да про науку, мол, тот феномен да еще вон тот феномен.Знаменитый ученый, герр профессор Луитпольд Блюмендуфт[] представил медицинские основания, в силу которых внезапный перелом шейных позвонков с проистекающим отсюда разрывом спинного мозга, согласно надежным и проверенным принципам медицинской науки, должен с неизбежностью повлечь сильнейшее ганглионное стимулирование нервных центров, заставляющее быстро расширяться поры  [], что, в свою очередь, резко увеличивает приток крови к части мужского организма, носящей название пенис, или же половой член, и вызывает феномен, который именуется в медицине патологической филопрогенитивной вертикально-горизонтальной эрекцией      [].Гражданин, уж само собой, только повода ждал, и тут же его вовсю понесло насчет непобедимых, старой гвардии, и героев шестьдесят седьмого года[], и про девяносто восьмой год не бойтесь говорить, и Джо в одну дудку с ним, обо всех, кого повесили, замучили, судили военно-полевым судом, и за новую Ирландию, за новое то да новое се. Раз ты за новую Ирландию, ты себе заведи для начала нового пса, так я считаю. А кабысдох паршивый кругом все обнюхивает, слюнявит, чешется и, гляжу, подбирается он к Бобу Дорену, который выставляет Олфу полпинты, и давай подлизываться к нему.Боб, ясное дело, начинает с ним дурака валять: Дай нам лапку! Ну дай лапку, песик! Славный, хороший песик! Ну, давай сюда лапку![], конец его лапанью песьих лап, и наверняка он с табуретки приземлился бы на свои четыре, прямо на окаянного пса, не подхвати его Олф, а сам все продолжает нести околесицу, мол, надо дрессировать лаской, и пес породистый, и пес умный, так что аж тошно делается. Потом просит Терри подать старую жестянку из-под печенья братьев Джекоб и начинает оттуда выскребывать крошки для пса. Ну, тот их проглотил одним духом и язык вывалил наружу, просит еще. Вместе с жестянкой чуть не слопал, зверюга.А Гражданин с Блумом завели спор насчет всего этого, про братьев Шире[], про Вулфа Тона невдалеке тут на Арбор-хилл, про Роберта Эммета и гибель за родину, и про плаксивый стих Томми Мура в честь Сэры Каррэн, Она вдали от той земли. Блум тут пыжится со своей сногсшибательной сигарой, с жирной физиономией, барина вовсю строит. Феномен! Жена его, толстая туша, тоже отличный феномен, по спине хорошо кегельные шары катать. Когда они жили в Городском гербе мне рассказывал Сикун Берк там была старуха одна с придурковатым племянником[] и Блум ее все пытался охмурить больного из себя корчил играл с ней в безик в тех видах значит чтоб потом ему обломилось по завещанию и мяса по пятницам не ел потому как старуха первостатейная ханжа и того блажного на прогулки водил. И вот однажды повел он его по всем дублинским кабакам как добрый пастырь и все поддавал да поддавал пару пока не приволок домой упившимся хуже вареной совы причем объяснил, что это он мол хотел ему преподать урок о вреде алкоголя[], а три бабы, ей-ей, чуть его не съели живьем, это цирк, та старуха, жена его и миссис ОДауд[], хозяйка гостиницы. Черт побери, я со смеху лег, когда Сикун передразнивал, как там бабы костят его, а он, Блум, все со своими но видите ли да но с другой стороны . А самое-то интересное, мне рассказывали, что этот придурок работал потом у винного оптовика Пауэра на Коуп-стрит, и каждый божий день домой возвращался на бровях, после того как по службе перепробует всю продукцию в заведении. Феномен! Памяти павших,  говорит Гражданин, поднимает свою кружку и смотрит в упор на Блума. Правильно,  присоединяется Джо. Но вы не улавливаете мою мысль,  Блум ему.  Я хочу сказать  !  перебивает его Гражданин.    ![] Любимые друзья бок о бок с нами, заклятые враги  лицом к лицу[].Последнее прощание было невыразимо трогательным[]. Со всех ближних и дальних колоколен доносился несмолкаемый похоронный звон, а повсюду вокруг назначенного места скорби раскатывалась зловещим предвестием приглушенная дробь сотен и сотен барабанов, перемежаемая гулкими артиллерийскими залпами. Оглушительные раскаты грома и яркие вспышки молний, озарявшие ужасную сцену, свидетельствовали о том, что небесная артиллерия решила явить всю свою сверхъестественную мощь ради вящей грандиозности зрелища, и без того вселявшего дрожь. Разгневанные небеса разверзли хляби свои, и проливной дождь потоками низвергался на обнаженные головы собравшихся толп, в которых, по самым скромным подсчетам, было не менее пятисот тысяч человек. Сводный отряд Дублинской городской полиции под личным руководством главного комиссара поддерживал порядок в этом обширном скоплении народа, а чтобы скоротать время ожидания, духовой оркестр Йорк-стрит, украсив инструменты траурным крепом, предлагал слуху собравшихся великолепное исполнение той бесподобной мелодии, которую уроднила нам с колыбели рыдающая муза Сперанцы[]. Скоростные экскурсионные поезда и комфортабельные пассажирские кареты с мягкой обивкой предоставлены были к услугам наших провинциальных сородичей, прибывавших большими группами. Бурное оживление вызвали любимцы дублинской публики, уличные певцы Л-н-х-н и М-лл-г-н, со своим неизменным заразительным весельем исполнившие В ночь перед тем, когда вздернули Ларри[]. Два наших неподражаемых комика сделали фантастический сбор среди ценителей юмора, продавая листовки со словами и музыкой своего коронного номера, и ни один из тех, кто лелеет в сердце любовь к истинно ирландской шутке, лишенной тени вульгарности, не попрекнет их оболом, добытым в поте лица. Детишки из Приюта Подкидышей Женского и Мужского Пола, гроздьями облепившие окна, что выходили к месту события, были в восторге от этого нежданного дополнения к обычным забавам, и тут по праву стоит сказать слова похвалы в адрес монахинь-попечительниц за их превосходную идею доставить бедным малышам, лишенным матери и отца, поистине поучительное зрелище. Гости вице-короля, среди которых можно было заметить многих блистательных светских дам, в сопровождении Их Сиятельств проследовали к удобнейшим местам на большой трибуне, между тем, как живописная иностранная делегация[], известная как Друзья Изумрудного Острова, разместилась на трибуне напротив. В эту делегацию, которая присутствовала в полном своем составе, входили командор Бачибачи Бенинобеноне (наполовину парализованный дуайен группы, доставленный к своему месту посредством мощного парового подъемного крана), мсье Пьер-Поль Птипузан, великошут Владимир Сморкальников, архишут Леопольд Рудольф фон Шванценбад-Ходенталер, графиня Мара Вирага Кишасони Путрапешти, Хайрем А.Бомбуст, граф Атанатос Карамелопулос, Али Баба Бакшиш Рахат Лукум Эфенди, сеньор идальго кабальеро дон Пекадильо-и-Палабрас-и-Патерностер де ла Малора де ла Малариа, Хокопоко Харакири, Пли Хунг Чанг, Олаф Кобберкеддельсен, мингерр Трик ван Трумпс, пан Польский-Педеревский, гусьподин Прклстр Кратчинабритчисич, герр Бардакдиректорпрезидент Ханс Хуэхли-Стоитли, ординарныйприватдоцент государственныхгимназиймузеевсанаториевисуспензориеввсеобщейисторииэкстра ординарныйпрофессордоктор Кригфрид Юберальгемайн. Все без исключения делегаты в энергичнейших и разноязычнейших выражениях заклеймили неслыханное варварство, свидетелями коего предстояло им стать. В дальнейшем среди ДИО завязался оживленный диспут о том, какова истинная дата рождения святого покровителя Ирландии, восьмое или девятое марта.Активное участие приняли все. В ходе дискуссии широко применялись пушечные ядра, ятаганы, бумеранги, аркебузы, дымовые завесы, тесаки, зонтики, катапульты, кастеты, дубины, чугунные болванки; происходил непринужденный и щедрый обмен ударами. Постовой Макфадден по прозвищу Мальчик с пальчик, вызванный с нарочным из Бутерстауна, во мгновение ока восстановил порядок и с блестящей находчивостью предложил в качестве решения спора семнадцатое число, равно воздающее честь каждой из тяжущихся партий[]. Предложение двухметрового самородка пришлось сразу по вкусу всем и было единодушно принято. Сердечные поздравления постовому Макфаддену принесли все ДИО, многие из которых были покрыты кровавыми ранами. Командор Бенинобеноне был извлечен из-под председательского кресла, и его юрисконсульт Адвокате Пагамими[] разъяснил, что разнообразные предметы, таившиеся в его тридцати двух карманах, были им отчуждены во время побоища из карманов более молодых коллег, в надежде призвать их к здравому смыслу. Указанные предметы (в том числе несколько сотен золотых и серебряных мужских и дамских часов) были незамедлительно возвращены законным владельцам, и торжество гармонии было полным.Спокойно и просто Рамболд поднялся на эшафот в безукоризненном деловом костюме, с любимым своим цветком  [] в петлице. Он возвестил о своем появлении тем милым, чисто рамболдовым откашливаньем, которому столь многие пытались (и безуспешно) подражать  коротким, натужным, неповторимо присущим лишь ему одному. Прибытие всемирно прославленного палача было встречено бурей приветственных восторгов всей огромной массы собравшихся, дамы из окружения вице-короля в экстазе размахивали платочками, а иностранные делегаты, в еще большем воодушевлении, издавали ликующие клики, слившиеся в многоголосый хор: хох, банзай, эльен, живио, чинчин, полла крониа, гип-гип, вив, Аллах , на фоне которого легко можно было различить звонкое эввива делегата из страны песен (его высокое и долгое фа напоминало те дивные пронзительные ноты, которыми евнух Каталани[] пленял наших прапрабабушек). Ровно в семнадцать часов через мегафоны был подан сигнал к молитве, и во мгновение ока головы всех были обнажены; патриархальное сомбреро, со времен революции Риенци[] принадлежавшее семье командора, было бережно снято с головы последнего его дежурным личным врачом, доктором Пиппи. Высокоученый прелат, явившийся предоставить герою-мученику на пороге казни последние утешения нашей святой религии, с истинно христианским смирением преклонил колена в луже дождевой воды, задрав сутану на свою седовласую голову, и обратил к престолу милосердия горячие и усердные молитвы. Рядом с плахой возвышалась зловещая фигура совершителя казни, чье лицо закрывал десятигаллоновый горшок с двумя круглыми прорезанными отверстиями, сквозь которые яростно сверкали его глаза. В ожидании рокового знака он пробовал остроту своего ужасающего оружия, то подтачивая его о свое мускулистое предплечье, то мгновенными взмахами отрубая головы барашкам, доставленным для этой цели поклонниками его жестокого, но необходимого искусства. На изящном столике красного дерева перед ним аккуратно были разложены нож для четвертования, набор инструментов для потрошения (выполненных из лучшей стали по специальному заказу мастерами знаменитой шеффилдской фирмы Джон Раунд и Сыновья), горшочек из терракоты, куда по мере успешного извлечения должны были помещаться двенадцатиперстная кишка, толстая кишка, слепая кишка, аппендикс и т.д., а также два вместительных молочных кувшина, предназначенных для собирания драгоценнейшей крови драгоценнейшей жертвы.Эконом Объединенного Приюта для Кошек и Собак имел предписание доставить эти сосуды, по наполнении их, в указанное благотворительное заведение.Аппетитнейшая трапеза, состоявшая из яичницы с беконом, превосходно зажаренного бифштекса с луком, горячих хрустящих булочек и бодрящего чая, была любезно предложена устроителями главному герою трагедии, который, приготовившись к смерти, демонстрировал отличное расположение духа и живой интерес ко всем деталям происходящего; однако, проникшись величием момента и проявив самоотречение, небывалое в наши дни, он выразил последнюю волю (исполненную незамедлительно), чтобы трапеза его была разделена поровну между членами Общества Больных и Неимущих Квартиросъемщиков в знак его внимания и почтения. Волнение достигло  и   [], когда невеста-избранница прорвалась сквозь плотные ряды зрителей и бросилась, зардевшись, на его мужественную грудь, грудь того, кому через миг предстояло отправиться в вечность ради ее прекрасных глаз. Герой любовно заключил в объятия ее гибкий стан, шепча с нежностью: Шейла, моя любимая[]. Воодушевленная звуками своего имени из его уст, она покрыла страстными поцелуями все разнообразные части его особы, каких только ее пылкость могла достичь через препоны его тюремных одежд. Соленые ручьи их слез слились в единый поток, и она поклялась ему, что будет вечно хранить память о нем и никогда не забудет своего геройского парня, который пошел на смерть с песенкой на устах, как будто на хоккейный матч в парке Клонтерк. Она напомнила ему златые дни счастливого детства, которое они провели вместе на берегах Анны Лиффи в невинных отроческих играх. Забыв весь ужас действительности, они хохотали от души, и зрители как один, не исключая достопочтенного пастора, предались вместе с ними дружному безудержному веселью. Чудовищная толпа буквально-таки помирала со смеху. Однако скорбь вскоре взяла свое; и вот уже они сплели свои пальцы в последний раз. Ручьи слез хлынули с новой силой из их слезных протоков, и все несметное собранье людей, потрясенное до глубины, разразилось душераздирающими рыданиями. Сам престарелый служитель Господа был растроган отнюдь не менее остальных. Рослые закаленные мужи, блюстители порядка и добродушные исполины из ирландской королевской полиции, не таясь, прибегали к помощи носовых платков, и можно с уверенностью сказать, что ничьи глаза не остались сухими во всем этом грандиозном собрании. Засим случилось романтичнейшее происшествие: юный красавец, выпускник Оксфордского университета, известный своим рыцарским отношением к прекрасному полу, выступил вперед и, представив свою визитную карточку, чековую книжку и родословное древо, просил руки несчастной молодой леди, умоляя немедленно назначить день свадьбы. Его предложение с готовностью было принято. Каждой даме из публики вручен был изящный сувенир в виде брошки с черепом и костями, и этот дар, столь щедрый и подобающий случаю, вызвал новый прилив восторга. Когда же галантный питомец Оксфорда  заметим попутно, носитель одной из самых громких фамилий в истории Альбиона  надел на палец зардевшейся невесты бесценное обручальное кольцо с изумрудами, образующими трилистник из четырех листьев, общий энтузиазм перешел все границы. Что говорить, даже сам грозный глава военной полиции, подполковник Томкин-Максвелл Ффренчмаллен Томлинсон, руководивший печальною церемонией, тот самый, что, не моргнув глазом, дюжинами отправлял в ад сипаев, привязывая их к жерлам пушек[], не в силах был сдержать своих чувств. Его рука в железной перчатке смахнула непрошеную слезу, и те избранные бюргеры, что составляли его ближайший [], могли уловить прерывистый шепот: Эх в богово ребро ну краля ну забористая бабенция. В богово ребро, так бы и взвыл, глядя на нее как вспомнишь старую лоханку что поджидает дома в Лаймхаусе[].И тут Гражданин пошел толковать про ирландский язык, заседание муниципалитета и все прочее да честить тех [], которые не знают родного языка. Джо тоже встревает, раз уж он наколол кого-то на фунт, и Блум туда же, надсаживает глотку, дымит своим грошовым окурком, что выклянчил у Джо, да разоряется про Гэльскую лигу и лигу противников угощения[] и что, мол, пьянство  это проклятье Ирландии.Не угощать, не выставлять дружкам выпивку  и все, мол, будет в порядке.Еще бы, сам-то он зальет себе в пасть, чего ты ему ни выставь, а от него пены с пинты не дождешься до второго пришествия. Я тут как-то пошел с приятелем на ихний музыкальный вечер, танцы и песни она приляжет на стожок и скажет где ты мой дружок[], потом один деятель со значком Общества трезвости из кожи лез, чесал по-ирландски, и тут же целая куча  , разгуливают с безалкогольными напитками, медальки какие-то продают, оранжад, лимонад да занюханные пирожки  одно слово, роскошь, [] развлечение. Ирландия трезва  Ирландия свободна[]. А потом какой-то старый козел принимается дуть в волынку, и вся эта похоронная компания притопывает ногами под музыку, от которой корова сдохнет. И ко всему еще двое длиннорясых орясин следят, чтоб никто не подваливался к бабенкам  уж вовсе, я скажу, удар ниже пояса.Ну, так да эдак, о чем я бишь, старая псина, увидевши, что жестянка пуста, начинает егозить вокруг меня с Джо. Будь он моим, я б его подрессировал лаской, я не я буду. Хорошего пинка наподдать да потом снова напомнить, чтобы не по глазам только. Что, боишься, укусит?  Гражданин ухмыляется. Да нет,  говорю.  Только не принял бы он моей ноги за фонарный столбик.Отозвал свою псину. Ну чего ты, ну чего, Гарри?  говорит ему.И давай его валять да трепать да толковать ему по-ирландски, а этот шелудяга рычит в ответ, так что у них выходит чистая опера с дуэтом.Такого рычанья век не услышишь, как они между собой развели. Кто-нибудь, кому делать нечего, пускай написал бы письмо в газеты,   [], чтобы на таких вот собак непременно надевали намордники. Рычит, ворчит, глаза налились кровью от жажды, и с морды бешенство капает.Все, кто интересуется передачей человеческой культуры нашим низшим собратьям (а имя им  легион), никоим образом не должны упустить из виду поразительные проявления кинантропии[], продемонстрированные знаменитым рыжим ирландским сеттером-волкодавом, который известен был прежде под [] Гарриоун, однако недавно обширным кругом друзей и знакомых был переименован в Оуна Гарри[]. Указанные проявления, итог многолетней дрессировки лаской и тщательно продуманной системы питания, включают, наряду с прочими достижениями, также и чтение стихов.Крупнейший из ныне здравствующих специалистов по фонетике (имя его из нас не вытянут и клещами!) употребил гигантские усилия на то, чтобы проделать сравнительный анализ читаемых стихов, причем обнаружил разительное их сходство (курсив наш) с рунами древних кельтских бардов. Мы говорим здесь не столько о тех прелестных любовных песнях, с которыми познакомил мир книголюбов автор, укрывшийся под очаровательным псевдонимом Хрупкая Веточка[], но скорее о тех более резких и личных (как указывает некий мистер Д.О.К. в интересном сообщении, промелькнувшем в одном из наших вечерних изданий) мотивах, которые мы находим в сатирических излияниях знаменитого Рафтри[], а также Донола Макконсидайна, не говоря уж о более современном лирике, столь привлекающем ныне взоры просвещенного общества. Ниже мы предлагаем один отрывок в переводе на наш язык, принадлежащем видному ученому, имя которого мы в настоящий момент не вправе открыть, хоть мы и убеждены, что читатель сумеет извлечь из местных аллюзий больше, нежели простую подсказку. Метрическая система собачьего подлинника, напоминающая изощренные аллитеративные и изосиллабические правила валлийского энглина[], имеет гораздо большую сложность, но, как мы убеждены, читатель не сможет не признать, что общий дух донесен отлично. Возможно, стоит добавить, что эффект несравненно увеличивается, если читать стихи Оуна медленно и невнятно, голосом, напоминающим злобное сдавленное рычание.Проклятья глухие Я шлю судорожно Семижды будь тошно Тебе, Барни Кирнан, Воды не дает ни глотка Остудить мою глотку, Кишки мои все горят Потрохов лауриных хотят.Ну тут он попросил Терри принести псу воды, и, убей бог, как тот хлебает, было за милю слышно. А Джо его спрашивает, не против ли он, если повторить. Не откажусь,  отвечает,  , чтоб ты не подумал, будто я зло какое держу.Ей ей, он только прикидывается, что у него на плечах кочан. Шляется по всем кабакам с этой псиной старого Гилтрапа и ты моргнуть не успеешь обернет будто его угостить самая великая честь, так вот и сидит на шее у избирателей и налогоплательщиков. Вечный праздник для человека и зверя. А Джо мне: Ты как, можешь еще одну? А утка плавать может?  говорю. Повтори-ка нам, Терри,  говорит Джо.  А вы уверены, что не желаете ничего из разряда прохладительных жидкостей?  это он Блуму. Нет, спасибо,  тот отвечает.  Собственно, я зашел сюда для встречи с Мартином Каннингемом, понимаете ли, по поводу страховых дел бедняги Дигнама. Мартин меня попросил зайти в закладную контору. Дело в том, что он, то бишь Дигнам, заложил свою страховку и не уведомил страховую компанию, а в этом случае, по закону, кредитор-закладчик не может ничего получить. Потеха,  смеется Джо,  вот это отличный фокус, старый Шейлок сам себя наколол. А повезло-то на этом его жене, точно? Что ж,  говорит Блум,  уж это дело ее поклонников. Каких таких поклонников?  это Джо. Законников, я хотел сказать, адвокатов его жены,  поправляется Блум.И начинает всякую муть про залоговое законодательство и как лорд-канцлер выносит решение и интересы вдовы и был создан фонд а с другой стороны Дигнам остался должен некую сумму Бриджмену и если теперь жена или вдова будут оспаривать права кредитора-закладчика пока не забил мне все мозги этим залоговым законодательством. Он сам, прохвост, должен радоваться, что не угодил под законодательство как мошенник и бродяга, пусть скажет спасибо, дружок в суде выручил. Продавал какие-то липовые билеты под видом Венгерской королевской лотереи с привилегией от властей.Не верите  побожусь. Нет, про евреев вы мне не говорите! Венгерский королевский грабеж с привилегией.Тут возникает, пошатываясь, Боб Дорен и просит Блума передать миссис Дигнам, что он сочувствует ее горю и ему горько что он не мог быть на похоронах и передать ей что он сказал и каждый кто только знал его скажет что отродясь не бывало лучшего и честнейшего чем наш бедный Вилли ныне покойный передать ей. Путаясь в словах как в соплях. И жмет Блуму руку с трагическим видом передайте ей это. Пожмем, брат, руки. Ты мошенник и я мошенник. Льщусь, сударь, надеждою,  сказал он,  что я не злоупотребляю нашим знакомством (которое, сколь ни казалось бы малым в рассуждении времени, однако зиждется, смею верить, на обоюдном почтении), решаясь испросить у вас сию милость. Если же, паче чаяния, преступил я границы скромности, то пусть сама искренность чувств моих послужит во извинение моей дерзости. Помилуйте, сударь,  возразил собеседник.  Я совершенно уважаю те побуждения, коими вы были подвигнуты, и не пожалею усердия на исполнение комиссии вашей, утешаясь той мыслию, что сколь ни печален к ней повод, но уже самое изъявление доверия вашего ко мне чувствительно умягчает сей чаши горечь. Тогда позвольте же мне пожать руку вашу,  воскликнул он.  Не усомнюсь, что благородство вашего сердца верней, нежели скудные мои словеса, укажет вам, каковым способом передать терзание столь жестокое, что если б я отдался этому чувству, оно лишило бы меня дара речи.И на том отчаливает, стараясь держаться прямо. В пять, и уже мертвецки.Однажды ночью чуть-чуть не попал в кутузку, повезло, что Падди Леонард знал того полисмена, бляха -А. Накачался до бровей в притоне на Брайд-стрит после часа закрытия, да завел блудни с двумя шлюхами, тут же ихний кот с ними, и все глушат портер чайными чашками. Назвался шлюхам, будто бы он француз, Жозеф Манюо, и давай хулить католическую религию, а сам, между прочим, еще мальчишкой прислуживал за мессой в церкви Адама и Евы, глаза от восторга закрывал, и про то, кто сочинил новый завет и ветхий завет, не забывая их лапать и обжимать. Обе шлюхи со смеху подыхают, обчистили у него, остолопа, все карманы, пока он заливал кровать портером, и визжат, хохочут как очумелые. Давай, покажи-ка твой завет! А он шибко у тебя уже ветхий, твой завет? Хорошо, Падди там как раз проходил. А поглядеть на него в воскресенье, как он со своей женой-потаскушкой в церкви, она, вертя задом, шествует вдоль придела, туфли лакированные, не как-нибудь, на груди фиалки, мила как пончик, строит из себя барыньку. Сестрица Джека Муни. А мамаша, старая курва, сдает номера уличным парочкам. Джек ему вправил мозги по-свойски. Посулил, что пусть он только не женится на своих грехах, из него живо дурь вышибут.Терри, стало быть, приносит три кружки. Прошу,  говорит Джо, потчуя нас.  Прошу, Гражданин.  [],  отвечает тот. Твои успехи, Джо,  говорю.  Бывай здоров, Гражданин.Мать честная, а уж тот больше половины своей махнул. Его поить, это только под силу миллионеру. А кого долговязый хочет протолкнуть в мэры, Олф?  спрашивает Джо. Одного твоего друга,  тот отвечает. Наннетти?  спрашивает Джо.  Члена? Имен не называем,  говорит Олф. Я так и думал,  говорит Джо.  Я только что его видел еще с одним депутатом, с Вилли Филдом, на заседании скотопромышленников. Иопад длинновласый[],  говорит Гражданин,  извергающийся вулкан, любимец всех стран и кумир своей собственной.И Джо начинает заливать Гражданину про ящур, скотопромышленников, принятие срочных мер. Гражданин эти меры посылает куда подальше, а Блум давай толковать про серные ванны для лечения парши у овец, и какие отвары от кашля для телят, и про вернейшее средство от актиномикоза. Когда-то работал на живодерне. Слонялся с блокнотиком и карандашиком, путался у всех под ногами, покуда Джо Кафф не наградил его орденом пинка за то, что он нагрубил какому-то скотоводу. Мистер Всезнайка. Всех выучит кур доить.Сикун говорил, бывало, его жена в Городском гербе все плачется миссис ОДауд, слезы льет в три ручья на свои жировые складки. Он ей не даст спокойно зад подтереть, непременно привяжется, мельтешит вокруг да учит, как надо делать. Чего там у тебя сегодня в программе? Ах, да. Гуманное обращение. Ведь бедные животные страдают, и по словам экспертов, и лучшее из известных средств, не причиняющее никакой боли животному, и мягко втирать руками в пораженное место. Убей бог, с его руками только быть курощупом.Куд куд куд-куда. Ко ко ко, курочки. Вот наша курочка. Чернушка. Она нам несет яички. Когда она снесет яичко, она очень радуется.Кудах тах-тах. Ко ко ко. И тут приходит добрый дядя Лео. Он свою руку запустит под Чернушку и вынимает яичко. Кудах-тах-тах куд-куда. Ко ко ко-о. Как бы там ни было,  говорит Джо,  Филд и Наннетти сегодня отправляются в Лондон и сделают об этом запрос в палате общин. Вы уверены,  спрашивает Блум,  что советник уезжает? Дело в том, что я его хотел повидать. С почтовым пароходом сегодня вечером,  Джо отвечает. Какое невезение,  говорит Блум.  Мне так надо было. Может быть, только мистер Филд уезжает. Я не мог позвонить. Нет. Вы в самом деле уверены? Наннан тоже уезжает,  говорит Джо.  Лига поручила ему сделать завтра запрос о том, что комиссар полиции запретил ирландские виды спорта в парке. Как тебе это, Гражданин? Слук-на-хЭйреанн[].Мистер Рогати-Скотт (Молтифарнэм, националист[]): В связи с запросом моего уважаемого друга, депутата от Шиллелы, я бы хотел спросить глубокоуважаемого коллегу, действительно ли правительством были отданы распоряжения о том, чтобы упомянутых животных забивали, невзирая на отсутствие медицинских признаков их патологического состояния?Мистер Озверелл (Тамошант, консерватор): Уважаемые члены палаты уже располагают сведениями, которые были представлены комитету парламента. Я не думаю, что я мог бы добавить что-либо существенное к этим сведениям.Ответ на запрос уважаемого члена палаты будет утвердительным.Мистер Орелли (Монтенотте, националист): Отдавались ли аналогичные распоряжения касательно забоя животных человеческого рода, дерзнувших заниматься ирландскими видами спорта в парке Феникс?Мистер Озверелл: Ответ будет отрицательным.Мистер Рогати-Скотт: А не повлияла ли знаменитая митчелстаунская телеграмма глубокоуважаемого коллеги на политику господ из казначейства?(Шум в зале.) Мистер Озверелл: По этому вопросу я должен справиться с материалами.Мистер Плоски-Шутки (Банком, независимый): Стреляйте без колебаний.(Иронические аплодисменты со скамей оппозиции.) Председатель: К порядку! К порядку!(Заседание закрывается. Аплодисменты.)  Вот человек,  объявляет Джо,  который возродил ирландский спорт.Сидит перед нами собственной персоной. Человек, вырвавший из тюрьмы Джеймса Стивенса[]. Чемпион всей Ирландии по метанию шестнадцатифунтового молота. Какой у тебя лучший бросок, Гражданин?  [],  тот отвечает, напуская на себя скромность.  Хотя в свое время и я был не хуже других. Да уж оставь, Гражданин,  Джо ему.  Другим за тобой и во сне было не угнаться. Это что, в самом деле?  Олф спрашивает. Да-да,  отвечает Блум.  Хорошо известный факт. А вы не знали?И пошли они про ирландские виды спорта, и про игры, которыми тешатся , вроде лаун-тенниса, про ирландский хоккей и метание камня, про почвенность и да будет нация опять и все такое[]. Ну, Блум, само собой, и тут должен высказаться, мол, если у кого слабое сердце, то ему силовые упражнения вредны. Клянусь своими подштанниками, если подымешь с полу соломину и скажешь этому Блуму: Гляди, Блум. Видишь эту соломину? Это соломина ,  клянусь троюродной бабкой, он будет про нее толковать битый час, я точно вам говорю, и не запнется ни разу.В старинной зале Брайена ОКирнона на Срод-на-Бретон-Вег[]при содействии Слук-на-хЭйреанн состоялась интереснейшая дискуссия о возрождении старинных гэльских видов спорта и о значении физической культуры, как она понималась в Древней Греции, Древнем Риме и Древней Ирландии, для развития нации. Достопочтенный президент благородной ассоциации занимал председательское кресло, и публика была многочисленной.После содержательной речи председателя, блиставшей красноречием и энергией, завязалась интереснейшая и содержательнейшая дискуссия о желаемости возрождаемости древних игр и спортивных занятий наших древних панкельтских пращуров. Дискуссия проходила на высшем уровне учтивости, привычном в этом кругу. Широко известный и глубоко почитаемый труженик на ниве нашего древнего языка, мистер Джозеф Маккарти Хайнс, горячо призвал воскресить древние гэльские спортивные игры и забавы, каким предавался по утрам и вечерам Финн Маккул, дабы оживить лучшие традиции мощи, силы и мужества, донесенные к нам из глубины веков. Л.Блум, который получил смешанный прием, встретив как овации, так и свист, избрал противоположную точку зрения, и председатель  вокалист, уступая многочисленным просьбам и пылким аплодисментам со всех концов переполненной залы, заключил дискуссию замечательным исполнением поистине неувядаемой песни Да будет нация опять на слова бессмертного Томаса Осборна Дэвиса (к счастью, слишком общеизвестные, чтобы напоминать их здесь). Не убоявшись противоречия, мы скажем, что в этом исполнении наш ветеран, патриот и чемпион превзошел самого себя. Ирландский Карузо-Гарибальди был в превосходной форме, и его громовой голос как нельзя лучше явил себя в освященном временем гимне, спетом так, как мог спеть его только наш гражданин. Великолепному пению, которое своим сверхвысоким уровнем подняло еще выше его и без того высочайшую репутацию, с жаром аплодировали массы собравшихся, среди которых можно было увидеть многих видных деятелей нашего духовенства, равно как представителей прессы, судейского сословия и прочих просвещенных профессий. На этом собрание закончилось.В числе представителей духовенства[] находились высокопреподобный Вильям Делани, О.И., доктор словесности; преп. Джеральд Моллой, доктор богословия; преп. П.Дж.Кавана, Общины Святого Духа; преп. Т.Уотерс, викарий; преп. Дж.М.Айверс, приходский священник; преп. П.Дж.Клири, ордена францисканцев; преп. Л.Дж.Хикки, ордена братьев-проповедников; высокопреп.брат Николае, ордена францисканцев-капуцинов; высокопреп. Б.Горман, ордена босоногих кармелитов; преп. Т.Махер, О.И.; высокопреп. Джеймс Мэрфи, О.И.;преп. Джон Лейври, викарий по назначению; высокопреп. Вильям Доэрти, доктор богословия; преп. Питер Фейган, ордена марианцев; преп. Т.Бранган, ордена августинцев; преп. Дж.Флавин, викарий; преп. М.Э.Хеккетт, викарий;преп. В.Хэрли, викарий; монсеньор Макманус, генеральный викарий; преп.Б.Р.Слэттри, ордена Непорочного Зачатия Девы Марии; высокопреп.М.Д.Скалли, приходский священник; преп. Ф.Т.Перселл, ордена братьев-проповедников; высокопреп. Тимоти Горман, каноник, приходский священник; преп. Дж.Фланаган, викарий. В числе же мирян находились П.Фэй, Т.Кверк и многие, многие другие. Кстати, насчет силовых упражнений,  говорит Олф,  вы не были на этом матче Кео  Беннет? Нет,  отвечает Джо. Как я слыхал, мистер Такой-то сделал на этом чистую сотню фунтов. А кто? Буян, небось?  Джо спрашивает.Тут Блум влезает: Вот, например, в теннисе, там нужны ловкость и верный глаз. Буян, кто же,  говорит Олф.  Распустил слух, будто бы Майлер пьет без просыпу, чтоб на него не ставили, а тот на самом деле целыми днями потел, готовился. Знаем мы его,  говорит Гражданин.  Сын предателя[]. Знаем, откуда у него английское золото в карманах. Что верно, то верно,  соглашается Джо.Тут Блум опять влезает про лаун-теннис и про кровообращение и спрашивает у Олфа: А вы так не считаете, Берген? Майлер его по полу растер,  гнет свое Олф.  Матч Хинен  Сейерс  это детская шутка, если сравнить. Отлупил так, что тот папу с мамой забыл.Это надо видеть, один  стручок, едва до пупа тому, а другой, каланча, знай молотит по воздуху. Эх, а под конец еще в поддых двинул. От такого выблюешь, чего и не жрал. Правила Куинсбери[], все как надо.То был памятный и жестокий бой, в котором Майлер и Перси оспаривали приз в пятьдесят соверенов. Любимец Дублина, будучи намного легче соперника, с лихвой возмещал эту невыгоду своим фантастическим искусством.Фейерверк финального раунда едва не стал роковым для обоих чемпионов. В предыдущем раунде артиллерист-тяжеловес для начала слегка пролил красного винца, четко обработав любимцу нос, так что Кео, Главный Получатель и с правой и с левой, выглядел как под мухой. Солдат продолжил дело мощным коротким слева, но тут ирландский гладиатор ответил молниеносным прямым, целясь Беннету в челюсть. Красный мундир сделал нырок, но наш дублинец настиг его левым хуком, отличнейшим ударом по корпусу. Противники перешли в ближний бой. Майлер, развив бурную деятельность, подавил своего соперника, и к концу раунда здоровяк висел на канатах, осыпаемый градом ударов. Англичанин, правый глаз которого совершенно заплыл, удалился в свой угол и, освежившись изрядным количеством воды, к моменту гонга был снова бодр и полон отваги, не сомневаясь, что живо пошлет в нокаут бойца из Эбланы. Это был бой до победы, и победа ждала сильнейшего. Оба дрались как тигры. Волнение зрителей достигло предела. Судья сделал Вояке Перси два предупреждения за захваты, однако любимец был ловок, и как работали его ноги  это стоило видеть. После беглого обмена любезностями, в ходе которого у Майлера кровь полилась изо рта ручьем от элегантного солдатского апперкота, любимец вдруг резко перешел в наступление по всем фронтам и нанес Беннету ошеломляющий левый в живот. Вояка рухнул на землю как сноп. То был нокаут, чистый и мастерский. Среди напряженного молчания над портобелльским тузилой начали отсчитывать секунды. Но тут Оле Пфоттс Веттштейн[], секундант Беннета, выбросил на ринг полотенце, и парень из Сентри был объявлен победителем под бешеные овации и крики зрителей, которые хлынули на ринг и в бурном восторге едва не затоптали героя. Уж он-то своей выгоды не упустит,  говорит Олф.  Я слышал, сейчас он устраивает концертное турне по северу. Я тоже слыхал,  говорит Джо.  А что, разве нет? Кто?  говорит Блум.  Ах, да. Совершенно верно. Нечто типа летних гастролей, понимаете. Так, отдохнуть. Миссис Б. будет яркой и несравнимой звездой[], не так ли?  Джо спрашивает. Моя жена?  говорит Блум.  Да, она будет петь. Я думаю, все должно быть успешно. Он просто отличный организатор. Отличный.Хо хо, так вот оно что, сказал я себе, сказал[]. Вот собака-то где зарыта. Буян исполняет мелодию на флейте. Концертное турне. Сынок вонючего симулянта с Айленд-бридж, старого Дэна, который тех же лошадей продавал правительству по два раза во время бурской войны. Мистер Чего-чего. Я к вам насчет налогов, водного и на бедных, мистер Бойлан. Насчет чего?Налога, водного, мистер Бойлан. Чего-чего? А этот хлыщ, уж он организует ее, это я вам ручаюсь. Все между нами, цыпочка.Гордость скалистой Горы Кальпы[], дочь Твиди, дева с волосами черней воронова крыла. Там возрастала она, там расцветала ее краса, где мушмула и миндаль наполняют воздух своим ароматом. Сады Аламеды[] знали легкую ее поступь, оливковые рощи узнавали ее и кланялись, клоня ветви. То непорочная супруга Леопольда, роскошногрудая Мэрион.И се, зрите, грядет муж из клана ОМоллоев, пригожий и белолицый, с легким румянцем, советник его величества, в законах всеведущий, и с ним принц и наследник благородного рода Лэмбертов. Привет, Нед. Привет, Олф. Привет, Джек. Привет, Джо. Спаси вас Бог,  говорит Гражданин. Спаси и вас Он по Своей доброте,  говорит Дж.Дж.  Чего вы возьмете, Нед? Половинку,  Нед отвечает.Дж.Дж. заказывает им выпить. В суде толкались?  Джо спрашивает. Да,  отвечает Дж.Дж.  Он все устроит, Нед,  это он Неду. Будем надеяться,  говорит Нед.Значит, какие у этой пары делишки? Дж.Дж. устраивает, чтобы того вычеркнули из списков присяжных, а тот ему помогает перебиться. Его имя-то уже у Стаббса[]. Картеж да кутеж с шикарными вертопрахами при моноклях, шампанское рекой и, ясно, завяз по шею в счетах да повестках в суд.Закладывал свои золотые часы у Камминса на Френсис-стрит, где никто не знает его, а я там возьми да и окажись с Сикуном, тот как раз сапоги из заклада выкупал. Как ваша фамилия, сэр? А он отвечает: Палл. Ага, думаю, этот крепко попал.Ей ей, однажды он горько обо всем пожалеет, могу ручаться. А вы там не видели этого чокнутого, Брина?  Олф спрашивает.  К.к.:ку ку. Видели,  отвечает Дж.Дж.  Искал частного детектива. Ага,  это уже Нед,  он было прямиком собрался к судье, только Корни Келлехер его завернул, сказал, что надо сначала провести экспертизу почерка. Десять тысяч фунтов,  смеется Олф.  Эх, я бы дорого дал за то, чтоб полюбоваться на него перед судьей и присяжными. Небось, твоя это работа, Олф?  Джо спрашивает.  Говорите правду, всю правду, ничего кроме правды, и да поможет вам Джимми Джонсон[]. Моя?  возмущается Олф.  Прошу не капать на мою кристальную репутацию. Любое заявление, сделанное вами,  Джо ему,  может использоваться как свидетельство против вас. Иск у него, конечно, должны принять,  говорит Дж.Дж.  Ведь там подразумевается, что он не  []. К.к.: ку-ку. Засунь компос себе в нос!  Олф смеется.  Ты что, не знаешь, что он чокнутый? Стоит взглянуть на его башку. Ты знаешь, что он по утрам себе помогает рожком для обуви, когда надо на нее шляпу напялить? Да,  возражает Дж.Дж.,  но в глазах закона истинность порочащих сведений не освобождает от судебной ответственности за их огласку. Ай-яй-яй, Олф,  сочувствует Джо. Но все-таки,  говорит Блум,  если подумать про бедную женщину, я хочу сказать, про жену его. Да, жаль ее,  говорит Гражданин.  И вообще всякую, у которой муж ни то ни се. Как это ни то ни се?  Блум спрашивает.  Вы хотите сказать Я хочу сказать, ни то ни се,  Гражданин повторяет.  Такой, который ни рыба ни мясо. А черт знает что,  говорит Джо. Вот это я и хотел сказать,  говорит Гражданин.  [], если вам известно, что это значит.Ну, я чую, каша заваривается. Блум все объясняет, он, мол, имел в виду, как это жестоко, когда бедная женщина всюду должна таскаться за своим тронутым заикой. А что, оно и впрямь жестокое обращение с животными, когда Брина выпускают пастись, нищего этого идиота, бородой по земле метет, от такой картинки небеса дождем прослезятся. А она-то еще нос задирала, когда вышла за него, как же, его троюродный дядюшка  прислужник в церкви при самом папе. Портрет его на стене, с закрученными усами, синьор Брини из Саммерхилла[], гутальянец, папский зуав при Святейшем Отце, покинул набережную и переселился на Мосс-стрит. А кто он такой, скажите на милость? Да никто, в третьем этаже комнатенка, семь шиллингов в неделю, окна во двор, и разгуливал, навешав себе на грудь каких-то жестянок в знак вызова всему миру. А почтовая открытка,  продолжает Дж.Дж.,  означает огласку. В прецедентном деле Сэдгрова против Хоула[] это признали достаточным доказательством злого умысла. По моему мнению, иск могут принять.Опять двадцать пять, приехали. Да кому оно надо, твое мнение? Дай нам спокойно пивка попить. Ей-ей, уже и этого не дадут. Ваше здоровье, Джек,  говорит Нед. И ваше, Нед,  это Дж.Дж. А вот и опять он,  говорит Джо. Где-где?  спрашивает Олф.И, убей бог, он снова плетется мимо дверей, томищи оба под мышкой, а рядом жена и Корни Келлехер, тот зыркнул к нам, проходя, своим оловянным глазом, а сам все время ему отечески втолковывает, пытается всучить гробик, бывший в употреблении. А как там дело о канадском мошенничестве?  Джо спрашивает. Отложено,  отвечает Дж.Дж.Это, значит, некто из крючконосой братии по имени Джеймс Воут, он же Шапиро, он же Спарк, он же Спайро, поместил в газетах, что он любому желающему обеспечивает проезд в Канаду за двадцать шиллингов. Чего? Вы что, меня за кретина считаете? Нечего говорить, это все был чистейший блеф. Как вам это? Всех околпачил, не только разных служанок да мужичье из графства Мит, но заодно уж и своих соплеменников. Дж.Дж. рассказывал, там один древний иудей, Зарецкий или как бишь его, стоит на свидетельском месте, не снявши шляпу, льет слезы и клянется святым Моисеем, что его накололи на два фунта. А кто вел процесс?  Джо спросил. Главный судья,  отвечает Нед. Бедный старый сэр Фредерик,  говорит Олф,  его каждый младенец обведет вокруг пальца. Большое сердце, больше чем у слона,  Нед за ним.  Ему расскажут страшную сказку про долги за квартиру и про больную жену и кучу детей, и, убей бог, он тут же разрыдается в своем кресле. Точно,  соглашается Олф.  Рувиму Дж. просто дьявольски повезло, ему как пить дать полагалась кутузка за то, что разорил Гамли, бедняга теперь булыжники стережет возле Баттского моста.И начинает передразнивать, как этот старикан, главный судья, причитает: Вовеки неслыханно! Этот бедный труженик! Сколько у вас детей? Десять, вы говорите? Да, ваша честь. А у жены моей брюшной тиф. И жена лежит с тифом! Какой позор! Извольте немедленно покинуть зал, сэр. Нет, сэр, я не вынесу постановления о взыскании. И как вы посмели, сэр, явиться сюда с таким иском! Бедный усердный труженик! Я прекращаю дело.И был день шестнадцатый месяца волоокой богини и неделя третья по светлом празднике Троицы Единосущной и Нераздельной, дочь же небес, луна дева, пребывала в своей первой четверти, и вот, свершилось, что просвещенные судьи направились в чертоги закона. И там магистр Кортни, заседающий в своей палате, представил свое суждение, а судья, магистр Эндрюс, заседавший без присяжных в суде по наследственным делам, со вниманием рассмотрел и взвесил права первого истца на имущество, означенное в подлежащем утверждению завещании и в окончательном завещательном распоряжении касательно недвижимого и движимого имущества умершего Джекоба Холлидея, виноторговца, покойного, против прав Ливингстона, несовершеннолетнего, душевнобольного, и компаньона. И вот под торжественные своды суда на Грин-стрит вступил сэр Фредерик, Сокольничий[].И воссел он там около пятого часу, дабы вершить правосудие по законам брехонов[] в комиссии, поставленной для всего того округа и для прилежащих и для графства города Дублин. И восседал вкупе с ним великий синедрион[] двенадцати колен Иаровых, по одному мужу от каждого из колен, от колена Патрикова и от колена Хьюгова и от колена Оунова и от колена Коннова и от колена Оскарова и от колена Фергусова и от колена Финнова и от колена Дермотова и от колена Кормакова и от колена Кевинова и от колена Куилтова и от колена Оссианова, и всего было их двенадцать мужей, честных и праведных. И он заклинал их Умершим на кресте, дабы они судили здраво и справедливо, и высказали справедливое суждение по делу их повелителя короля против подсудимого, и вынесли бы справедливый вердикт в соответствии со всеми показаниями, в чем да поможет им Бог, и целуйте книгу. И они встали на своих местах, сии двенадцать Иаровых, и поклялись именем Предвечного, что будут править Его правый суд. И тотчас блюстители закона привели из казематов замка того, кого ищейки правосудия изловили, следуя полученным сведениям. И был он скован по рукам и ногам, и они не отпускали его ни под залог, ни на поруки, но нашли нужным предать суду, ибо был он злодей. Милое дело получается,  говорит Гражданин.  Приезжают к нам в Ирландию всякие и клопов тут разводят.Тут Блум делает вид, как будто ничего не слыхал, и начинает говорить Джо, что насчет той мелочи он может не беспокоиться до первого, но вот если бы он замолвил словечко мистеру Кроуфорду. А Джо ему клянется всеми святыми и на чем свет стоит, что он для него в лепешку готов разбиться. Потому что, видите ли,  объясняет Блум,  для рекламы необходим повтор. В этом-то весь секрет. Можете на меня положиться,  Джо обещает. Обманывают крестьян,  гнет свое Гражданин,  наживаются на ирландских бедняках. Больше мы не желаем чужаков в нашем доме. О, я уверен, все будет в порядке, Хайнс,  говорит Блум.  Просто уж этот Ключчи, понимаете. Считайте, что дело сделано,  Джо ему. Большая любезность с вашей стороны,  благодарит Блум. Чужаки,  Гражданин свое.  А виноваты мы сами. Сами пустили их. Сами сюда зазвали. Эта прелюбодейка со своим полюбовником[] зазвали сюда англосаксов, чтобы грабили нас. Условное постановление[],  говорит Дж.Дж.Теперь Блум притворяется, будто со страшным интересом разглядывает неведомо что, может, паутину в углу, Гражданин на него уставился с грозным видом, а пес у него в ногах поднял морду, глядит, пора ли уже бросаться и на кого. Опозоренная жена,  заявляет Гражданин,  вот где причина всех наших бедствий. А вот как раз и она,  говорит Олф, они с Терри все хихикали у стойки над Полис газетт,  во всей боевой раскраске. Дай-ка и нам глянуть,  говорю.А у них там, оказывается, одна из тех похабных американских картинок, которые Терри берет у Корни Келлехера. Секрет, как увеличить ваши интимные органы. Шалости светской красавицы. Норман В.Таппер, богатый подрядчик из Чикаго, находит свою прелестную, но неверную жену в объятиях капитана Тэйлора. Красавица в панталончиках предается шалостям, кавалер ее трогает за места, а Норман В.Таппер врывается со своим пугачом как раз, когда она только что поиграла с капитаном Тэйлором в палочку и колечко. Ах, Дженни, милочка,  говорит Джо,  не простудись без юбочки! Есть за что подержаться, Джо,  я ему.  Ты бы не прочь кус филея от этой телочки, а?То да се, а тем временем заходит Джон Уайз Нолан и за ним Ленехан, у которого физиономия вытянулась до шестой пуговицы. Ну-с,  говорит Гражданин,  изложите вести с театра событий. Чего там эти сапожники из муниципалитета решили на своем сборище насчет ирландского языка?ОНолан, в сияющую броню одетый, земным поклоном воздал должные почести великому и грозному и могучему владыке Эрина и поведал ему обо всем свершившемся, как достойные старейшины смиреннейшего из градов, второго во всем том царстве, встретили их под сводами Фолсела и там, вознеся подобающие молитвы богам-небожителям, торжественный держали совет, дабы решить, надлежит ли им, буде окажется то возможным, возвеличить вновь среди смертных крылатую речь морями разъединенных кельтов. Дело двигается,  говорит Гражданин.  К матери этих сукиных саксов, и с их кваканьем.Ну, тут Дж.Дж. давай строить просвещенного барина и заправляет де мол возможны разные точки зрения, и люди отворачиваются от фактов и вспомните прием Нельсона[], глядеть в трубу слепым глазом, и можно ли обвинять огульно целую нацию, а Блум ему вовсю подпевает про умеренность да похеренность да ихние колонии да ихнюю цивилизацию. Сифилизация, уж лучше сказать!  гремит Гражданин.  К матери их! Да разрази их всех в три слоя с покрышкой, этих тупых ублюдков! Ни в музыке, ни в литературе, ни в живописи, нигде у них ни хрена, одни жалкие потуги.Все, что у них из цивилизации,  это у нас украдено. Стадо гугнивых выродков! Семья европейских народов,  ОМоллой вякает Они никакие не европейцы,  режет Гражданин.  Я был в Европе с Кевином Игеном Парижским. Нигде в Европе никакого следа ни их, ни ихнего языка, если только в  [].А Джон Уайз говорит: Сколь многие цветы ничей не узрит взор[].А Ленехан, который слегка может по этой фене:   !  ![] Сказал он и поднял своей большой, заскорузлой и мощной дланью кубок крепкого, темного, пенистого эля и, испустив боевой клич своего клана Лам Дерг Абу[], осушил его за победу над врагом, над племенем могучих и отважных героев, что правят морями и восседают на алебастровых тронах[], безмолвные, словно бессмертные боги. Чего это с тобой приключилось?  я спрашиваю у Ленехана.  У тебя вид, как будто ты ждал триста, а получил свиста. Золотой кубок,  отвечает. Кто же выиграл, мистер Ленехан?  Терри спрашивает. Реклама,  тот отвечает.  Выдача двадцать к одному. Чистейший аутсайдер. А все остальные с носом. А Бассова кобылка?  опять Терри. Скоро доскачет,  говорит Ленехан.  Мы все накололись. Бойлан по моему совету поставил на Корону два фунта, за себя и за одну знакомую. Я и сам полкроны поставил,  говорит Терри,  на Муската, мне мистер Флинн подсказал. Лорда Хауарда де Уолдена. Двадцать к одному,  повторяет Ленехан.  Вот такая дерьмовая жизнь.Реклама,  повторяет.  Запудрила всем мозги и хапнула все печенье. Корона, тебе имя  вероломство[].Тут он подбирает жестянку от печенья, что Боб Дорен оставил, и смотрит, нет ли там чем поживиться на шаромыжку, а паршивая дворняга за ним, глядит, повезет ему или нет, разинув свою поганую пасть. Стала бабушка искать, хочет кость собачке дать. Шиш с маслом, детка,  тот ему. Держи хвост морковкой,  Джо утешает.  Корона бы выиграла, если б не эта сучка.А Дж.Дж. с Гражданином все препираются насчет истории да законов, и Блум, уж конечно, тоже суется. Некоторые люди,  говорит Блум,  в чужом глазу увидят соринку, а в собственном бревна не заметят. [],  отвечает Гражданин.  Не зря говорят, слепому очков не подберешь. Куда делись наши двадцать миллионов ирландцев, которых мы должны бы иметь сейчас вместо четырех, наши потерянные колена[]?А наши гончары, наши ткани, лучшие во всем мире? А наши сукна[], их еще в Риме продавали во времена Ювенала, и наш лен, и камчатное полотно, что ткут в Антриме, и кружева из Лимерика, и наши дубленые кожи, и флинтглас из-под Баллибоха, и гугенотский поплин, который у нас еще со времен Жаккара из Лиона, и наши тканые шелка, и фоксфордский твид, и кремовый гипюр из кармелитского монастыря в Нью-Россе, ничего подобного во всем мире нет! Где греческие купцы[], что проходили через Геркулесовы Столбы, ныне Гибралтар, захваченный врагом рода человеческого, и плыли в Вексфорд, на торжище Кармен, торговать золотом и тирским пурпуром? Почитайте-ка Тацита и Птолемея или хотя бы Гиральда Камбрийского[]. Вино, пушнина, мрамор из Коннемары, серебро из Типперери, совершенно непревзойденное, а лошади наши славятся и по сей день, ирландская упряжная порода, а за право ловить рыбу в наших водах король испанский Филипп готов был платить нам пошлину.Кто вычислит, сколько нам должен паршивый Джон Буль за нашу загубленную торговлю, за наши разоренные хижины? А русла Барроу и Шаннона, они не желают их углублять, они нам оставляют миллионы акров болот, чтобы мы подыхали от чахотки. Скоро у нас тут будет безлесье, как в Португалии[],  вставляет Джон Уайз,  или на каком-нибудь Гельголанде, где торчит одно деревце. Если только не примутся за лесопосадки. Ель, лиственница, все деревья, что из семейства хвойных, на глазах исчезают. Я вот читал доклад лорда Кэслтауна Их надо срочно спасать,  говорит Гражданин,  и ясень гигантский в Голуэе, и вяз святой Бригитты в Килдере[], сорок футов в обхвате и крона на добрый акр. Спасать деревья Ирландии для будущих поколений ирландцев, на дивных холмах Эйре, О[]! Европа смотрит на вас,  говорит Ленехан.Сливки высшего общества всей Европы собрались в этот вечер, чтобы присутствовать на бракосочетании шевалье Жана Уайза де Нолана, великого верховного главного смотрителя Ирландских Национальных Лесных Угодий, и мисс Елли Хвойн из Сосновой Долины. Леди Эктам Лесгуст, миссис Дебри Лесов, миссис Флора Полей, мадмуазель Манон Лесок, миссис Хилда Гнил-Кует, миссис Эдна Сень-Крон, неразлучные подруги Норма Дров и Порция Лоз, миссис Кора Березоу, известная писательница Джейн Осин, миссис Джулия Дубб, мисс Энн Бук, миссис Элен Клен, миссис Сильвия Платтан, миссис Тебена ОРехи, мисс Найди Шишки, мисс Сэра Соснер, мисс Полли Пихти, мисс Китти Кедрик, миссис Мона Листик, сестры мисс Лилия и мисс Виола Стеблинз, миссис Лиана Ползинс, мисс Лаура Мирт, мисс Орхидея Гор, миссис Мойра Мак-Мак, миссис Гортензия Флокс, мадемуазель ОМимоза-сан[] и миссис Глория Бревноу из Дуботолла украшали своим присутствием брачное торжество. Невеста, дочь достопочтенного эсквайра Мак-Хвойна из Больших Желудей, являла собой верх изящества в очаровательном туалете зеленого мерсеризованного шелка на чехле сумеречно-серых тонов, с широким изумрудно-зеленым поясом и тремя рядами оборок более темного оттенка, а также, в довершение ансамбля, бретельками и каштановыми вытачками на бедрах. Подружки невесты, мисс Пиния и мисс Туя, также из семейства Хвойнов, были в необычайно идущих им к лицу туалетах тех же тонов, с изящной розовой отделкой, мотивы которой прихотливо повторялись в нефритово-зеленых токах, украшенных эгретками из бледно-коралловых перьев цапли. Сеньор Энрике Флор, восседавший за органом, явил свое прославленное искусство и, в дополнение к музыке, предписанной венчальным каноном, завершил службу исполнением песни Лесоруб, лесоруб, не руби ты этот дуб в замечательной новой аранжировке.Когда молодые, получив папское благословение, покидали церковь святого Фиакра на бору, их шутливо осыпали целым градом орехов, желудей, лавровых листьев, барашков вербы, ивовых прутьев, ягод остролиста, веточек омелы и можжевеловых побегов. Мистер и Миссис Уайз Хвойн Нолан уединенно проведут свой медовый месяц в Черном Лесу. И мы смотрим на Европу,  говорит Гражданин.  Когда еще эти дворняжки были щенками[], мы уже торговали с Испанией и с французами и с голландцами, испанские суда плавали в Голуэй с грузом, от которого веселей, с винцом по винноцветному морю[]. И поплывут еще,  говорит Джо. И с помощью Пречистой Девы Марии еще поплывут,  повторяет Гражданин, трахая себя по ляжке.  Наши опустевшие гавани опять оживут, Куинстаун[], Кинсейл, Голуэй, Блэксод-бэй, Вентри, что в графстве Керри, Киллибегс, третий по величине порт во всем мире, целые леса мачт, корабли рода Линчей из Голуэя, и Кавана ОРейли, и дублинских ОКеннеди, а с графом Десмондом заключал союз сам император Карл Пятый. Да, поплывут,  давит он,  люди еще увидят первый ирландский броненосец бороздящим моря с нашим собственным флагом на флагштоке, не с этой треклятой арфой Генриха Тюдора, нет уж, а с древнейшим флагом провинций Десмонд и Томонд, три золотые короны на голубом поле, трое сыновей Милезия.И опрокидывает свою до дна. []. Грозный как жук навозный. Разводит белендрясы с подливой. Рискнул бы он с этим дерьмовым трепом выйти перед народом в Шейнаголдене[], туда он и нос показать не смеет, ему там Молли Магуайры давненько уж припасли свинцовый орешек за то, что он выгнал издольщика, а добро себе заграбастал. Ну-ну,  говорит Джон Уайз,  вы только послушайте. Чего будешь пить? Чего королевские гусары принимают для храбрости,  Ленехан отвечает. Половинку с прицепом, Терри,  заказывает Джон Уайз.  Эй, Терри!Никак, заснул? Сию минуту, сэр,  отвечает Терри.  Полпорции виски и бутылочку эля.Даю, сэр.Прилип к этой вшивой газетке с Олфом, выискивает там чего позабористей, вместо того чтоб обслуживать. Картинка матча, в котором дерутся головами, один другого старается трахнуть черепом, идет на него, пригнув голову, как бык на стенку. Еще картинка: Так сожгли черную скотину в Омахе, Джорджия[]. Орава героев в ковбойских шляпах до глаз палит в черномазого, повешенного на дереве, у того уже язык наружу, а внизу разложен костер.Ей ей, им бы еще утопить его в море, посадить на электрический стул и распять, чтобы уж были уверены в успехе. А как же непобедимый флот,  спрашивает Нед,  гроза всех врагов[]? Я вам про это кое-что расскажу,  говорит Гражданин.  Это сущий ад на земле. Почитайте-ка в газетах про то, как избивают палками на учебных судах в Портсмуте[]. Какой-то тип пишет за подписью Возмущенный.И давай нам рассказывать про телесные наказания, как выстраивается команда и офицеры, и адмирал тут же в треуголке, и пастор со своей протестантской библией, словом, все, чтоб присутствовать при наказании.Приводят беднягу, паренька, который вопит благим матом, растягивают на лафете орудия, привязывают. Отбивную и дюжину горячительного,  говорит Гражданин,  так это дело называл старый бандит сэр Джон Бересфорд[], ну а теперешние Кромвели это прозвали морской обычай.Джон Уайз вставляет: Обычай, что достойней уничтожить, чем сохранять[].А тот дальше рассказывает, как там выходит судовой инструктор с длинной тростью, размахивается и пошел сдирать шкуру с бедного малого, пока тот не наорется до хрипоты убивают. Вот вам славный британский флот,  говорит Гражданин,  который властвует над землей. Эти герои, что никогда не будут рабами[], у них единственная наследственная палата на всем Божьем свете[], а все земли в руках у дюжины надутых баронов да боровов, ни в чем не смыслящих, кроме псовой охоты. Вот она, их великая империя, которой они так бахвалятся,  империя рабов, замордованных и трудом и кнутом. Над которой никогда не восходит солнце,  вставляет Джо. И вся трагедия в том,  продолжает Гражданин,  что сами они в это верят. Несчастные йеху в это верят.Веруют во кнута-отца[], шкуродера и творца ада на земле, и в Джека-Матроса, сына прохожего, его же зачала Мэри-шлюха от несытого брюха, рожденного для королевского флота, страдавшего под отбивною и дюжиной горячительного, бичеванного, измордованного, и завывавшего аки зверь, и восставшего с койки на третий день по предписаниям, и пришедшего в порт и воссевшего на своей драной заднице, покуда не отдадут приказ и не потрюхает он опять вкалывать ради куска хлеба. Но ведь разве,  ввязывается Блум,  дисциплина не везде одинакова? Я хочу сказать, разве у вас не было бы то же самое, если бы вы против силы выставили свою силу?Ну что я вам говорил? Не пить мне этого портера, если он и до последнего издыхания не будет вам доказывать, что черное это белое. Мы выставим силу против силы,  говорит Гражданин.  У нас есть великая Ирландия за океа[]. Их выгнали из родного дома и родной страны в черном сорок седьмом году. Их глинобитные лачуги и придорожные хижины сровняли с землей, а в Таймсе радостно возвещали трусливым саксам, что скоро в Ирландии останется не больше ирландцев, чем краснокожих в Америке.Паша турецкий, и тот прислал нам какие-то пиастры. Но саксы нарочно старались задушить голодом нацию, и хоть земля уродила вдосталь, британские гиены подчистую скупали все и продавали в Рио-де-Жанейро.Крестьян наших они гнали толпами! Двадцать тысяч из них распростились с жизнью на борту плавучих гробов. Но те, что достигли земли свободных, не позабыли земли рабства. Они еще вернутся и отомстят, это вам не мокрые курицы, сыны Гранунл, заступники Кетлин-ни-Хулихан. Совершенно справедливо,  снова Блум за свое,  но я-то имел в виду Да мы уж давно этого ждем, Гражданин,  Нед вставляет.  Еще с тех пор, как бедная старушка нам говорила, что французы у наших берегов, с тех пор, как они высаживались в Киллале[]. Верно,  говорит Джон Уайз.  Мы сражались за Стюартов, а они предали нас, с головой выдали вильямитам[]. А вспомните Лимерик и нарушение договора на камне. Наши лучшие люди проливали кровь за Францию и Испанию, дикие гуси. Одна битва при Фонтенуа чего стоит! А Сарсфилд, а ОДоннелл, герцог Тетуанский в Испании, а Улисс Браун из Камуса, фельдмаршал в войсках Марии Терезии. Но что мы хоть когда-нибудь получили за это? Французы!  фыркает Гражданин.  Компашка учителей танцев! Как будто сами не знаете. Для Ирландии цена им всегда была грош ломаный. А нынче они из кожи лезут, устраивают  [] с коварным Альбионом, вроде обедов Тэй Пэя[]. Первые смутьяны Европы, и всегда ими были!   [],  говорит Ленехан, прибирая к рукам кружечку пива. А взять пруссаков и ганноверцев[],  Джо поддакивает,  мало, что ли, у нас сидело этих бастардов-колбасников на троне, от курфюрста Георга до этого немчика и старой суки со вспученным брюхом, что околела недавно?И, убей бог, мы все там полегли со смеху, как он изобразил нам про эту старушку Вик в розовых очках[], мол, что ни вечер, она в своем королевском дворце глушит нектар и амброзию кувшинами, а как упьется до поросячьего визга, тут ее кучер загребает в охапку и плюхает как мешок в постель, а она его дергает за баки да распевает допотопные песенки про Эрен на Рейне и приди туда, где выпивка дешевле. Ну что ж!  говорит Дж.Дж.  Зато теперь у нас Эдуард-миротворец. Сказки для дураков,  ему Гражданин на это.  У этого кобеля заботы  не мир наводить, а триппер не подхватить. Эдуард Гвельф-Веттин[]! А что вы скажете,  Джо ярится,  про этих святош, ирландских попов и епископов, которые разукрасили его покои в Мануте скаковыми эмблемами его Поганского то бишь Британского Величества да картинками всех лошадей, на которых его жокеи ездят? Как же, граф Дублинский. Туда б еще картинки всех баб, на которых он сам поездил,  предлагает малыш Олф.На это Дж.Дж. солидно: Их преосвященства были вынуждены отказаться от этой идеи за недостатком места. Еще одну сделаешь, Гражданин?  Джо спрашивает. О да, сэр,  тот ему. Ну, а ты?  это Джо мне. Бесконечно признателен,  отвечаю.  И дай тебе бог всяческого прибытку. Все то же повторить,  Джо заказывает.А Блум, в своем чернорыжегрязноболотном котелке на макушке, все мелет и мелет языком с Джоном Уайзом, входит в раж, глаза выкатил, что сливы. Преследования,  говорит,  вся мировая история полна ими. Разжигают ненависть между нациями. А вы знаете, что это такое, нация?  спрашивает Джон Уайз. Да,  отвечает Блум. И что же это?  тот ему снова. Нация?  Блум говорит.  Нация это все люди, живущие в одном месте. Ну, уморил,  смеется тут Нед.  Раз так, тогда нация это я, я уже целых пять лет живу в одном месте.Тут, конечно, все Блума на смех, а он пробует выпутаться: Или, возможно, живущие в разных местах. Под это я подхожу,  говорит Джо. А нельзя ли спросить, какова ваша нация?  Гражданин вежливенько. Ирландская,  отвечает Блум.  Здесь я родился. Ирландия.Гражданин на это ничего не сказал, но только выдал из пасти такой плевок, что, дай бог, добрую устрицу с Редбэнк отхаркнул аж в дальний угол. Ну как, поехали, Джо,  говорит он и вынимает платок, чтобы утереться. Поехали, Гражданин,  тот ему.  Возьмите это в правую руку и повторяйте за мной следующие слова.Древняя и бесценная, покрытая хитроумной вышивкой, ирландская лицевая пелена[], которую предание связывает с именами Соломона из Дромы и Мануса Томалтаха-ог-Мак-Доноха, авторов Книги Баллимот, была с величайшими предосторожностями извлечена на свет и вызвала благоговейное восхищение.Избегнем пространных описаний прославленной красоты ее четырех углов, из коих каждый  верх совершенства; скажем лишь, что на них можно было отчетливо различить четырех евангелистов, вверяющих четырем мастерам свои евангельские символы, скипетр мореного дуба, североамериканскую пуму (заметим вскользь, что это не в пример более благородный царь зверей, нежели объект британской геральдики), тельца из Керри и золотого орла с Каррантухилла. Виды же, заполняющие сморкательное поле, изображали наши древние дуны, раты, кромлехи и гриноны[], а также обители просвещения и каменные пирамиды, слагаемые в память о бедствиях, и были столь же прекрасны, а краски их столь же тонки, как и в те незапамятные времена, в пору Бармакидов, когда художники из Слайго отпустили поводья своего творческого воображения.Глендалох, дивные озера Килларни, развалины Клонмакнойса, аббатство Конг, Глен Ина и Двенадцать Сосен, Око Ирландии, Зеленые Холмы Талла, Крок-Патрик, пивоварня фирмы Артур Гиннесс, Сын и Компания (с огр. отв.), берега Лох-Ней, долина Овоки, башня Изольды, обелиск Мейпса, больница сэра Патрика Дуна, мыс Клир, долина Ахерлоу, замок Линча, Скотч-хаус, ночлежка Рэтдаун в Локлинстауне, тюрьма в Толламоре, пороги Каслконнел, Килбаллимакшонакилл, крест в Монастербойсе, отель Джури, Чистилище св.Патрика, Прыжок Лосося, трапезная в манутском колледже, Кэрлис-хоул, три места рождения первого герцога Веллингтонского, скала Кэшел, болото Аллен, склады на Генри-стрит, Фингалова пещера,  волнующие изображения всех этих мест поныне доступны взорам. Со временем они стали еще прекрасней благодаря тем потокам, что скорбно изливались на них, а также обильным наслоениям. Раздай-ка нам кружки,  я прошу Джо.  Какая тут чья? Вот это мое,  говорит Джо,  как сказал черт мертвому полисмену. И еще я принадлежу к племени,  заявляет Блум,  которое ненавидят и преследуют. Причем и поныне. Вот в этот день. Вот в эту минуту.Бог ты мой, а окурок сигары ему совсем уже пальцы жжет. Грабят,  говорит он.  Обирают. Оскорбляют. Преследуют. Отнимают то, что наше по праву. Вот в эту самую минуту,  говорит он и поднимает кулак,  продают на рынке в Марокко, как рабов, как скот[]. Вы что ли говорите про новый Иерусалим[]?  Гражданин спрашивает. Я говорю про несправедливость,  отвечает Блум. Хорошо,  говорит Джон Уайз.  Но тогда сопротивляйтесь, проявите силу, как подобает мужчинам.Уж это будет незабываемая картинка. Мишень для разрывной пули. Старая жирная морда перед дулами пушек. Вот швабру он бы собой украсил отлично, только обряди его в фартук с завязочками. А потом вдруг, в один миг, у него душа в пятки, и он уже накручивает все другое, наоборот, жалкий слабак, тряпка. Но все это бесполезно,  отвечает он.  Сила, ненависть, история, все эти штуки. Оскорбления и ненависть  это не жизнь для человека. Всякий знает, что истинная жизнь  это совершенно противоположное. И что же?  Олф его спрашивает. Любовь,  отвечает Блум.  Я имею в виду, противоположное ненависти.Мне надо сейчас идти,  это он Джону Уайзу.  Тут рядом, заглянуть на минутку в суд, нет ли там Мартина. Если он придет, скажите ему, пожалуйста, что я скоро вернусь. Я на одну минуту.Да кто тебя держит-то? И выскакивает, как жирная молния. Новый апостол язычников,  бурчит Гражданин.  Всеобщая любовь. А что,  говорит Джон Уайз,  разве это не то же, что нам твердят?Возлюби ближнего своего. Кто, этот гусь?  Гражданин ему.  Да у него заповедь  обирай ближнего своего. Любовь, Моуа! Ромео и Джульетта, чистая копия.Любовь любит любить любовь[]. Медсестра любит нового аптекаря. Констебль бляха -А любит Мэри Келли. Герти Макдауэлл любит парня с велосипедом.М.Б. любит красивого блондина. Ли Чи Хань люби целовай Ча Пу Чжо. Слон Джамбо любит слониху Алису. Старичок мистер Вершойл со слуховым рожком любит старушку миссис Вершойл со вставным глазом. Человек в коричневом макинтоше любит женщину, которая уже умерла. Его Величество Король любит Ее Величество Королеву. Миссис Норман В.Таппер любит капитана Тэйлора. Вы любите кого-то. А этот кто-то любит еще кого-то, потому что каждый любит кого-нибудь, а бог любит всех. Ну ладно, Джо,  говорю,  бывай здоров и пой песни. А тебе еще больше сил, Гражданин. Ура!  рявкает Джо. Господь, Мария и Патрик да будут с вами,  говорит Гражданин.И опрокидывает свою кружку, чтоб промочить пасть. Знаем мы эти басни,  говорит он.  Читает благие проповеди, а сам в карман к тебе лезет. Как там богомольный Кромвель и его железнобокие[], что вырезали всех женщин и детей в Дрогеде, а на пушках у них вокруг дул было написано из библии: Бог есть любовь? Библия! Не читали в сегодняшнем Юнайтед айришмен фельетон про визит зулусского вождя в Англию[]? Нет, а что там?  Джо спрашивает.Гражданин вытаскивает из своего личного архива номер газеты и принимается нам читать: Делегация крупнейших хлопковых магнатов Манчестера была вчера представлена Его Величеству Алаки Абеакутскому дежурным Главой Протокола лордом Процедуром из Процедуры-на-Пустом-Месте, дабы выразить Его Величеству горячую благодарность английских коммерсантов за привилегии, данные им в его владениях. Члены делегации присутствовали на завтраке, в заключение которого темнокожий властитель произнес яркую речь, вольно переводившуюся британским капелланом, преподобным Ананией Богомолом Барбоном[]. В ней он выразил благодарность массе Процедуру и подчеркнул сердечность отношений, существующих между Абеакутой и Британской Империей, заявив, что величайшей драгоценностью для него является иллюстрированная библия, книга, в которой слово Божие и секрет могущества Англии, благосклонно подаренная ему предводительницей белых, великою скво Викторией, с личною надписью Августейшей Дарительницы. На этом владыка Алаки, провозгласив тост Черное и Белое, осушил чашу дружбы, полную первосортного ирландского виски, из черепа своего прямого предшественника на троне династии Какачакачаков, носившего прозвище Сорок Чирьев. Затем он осмотрел крупнейшую из фабрик Хлопкополиса и поставил свой крест в книге посетителей, исполнив при этом древний и очаровательный абеакутский военный танец, во время которого он проглотил множество ножей и вилок, поощряемый радостными рукоплесканиями юных работниц. Царственная вдовица,  говорит Нед,  выше всякого подозрения. Но интересно, не использовал ли он эту библию так же, как я бы на его месте. Так же, и даже еще лучше,  Ленехан уверяет.  Ибо потом на той плодородной земле выросло пышное манговое дерево с широкими листьями. А кто написал, Гриффит?  спрашивает Джон Уайз. Да нет,  отвечает Гражданин.  Там не подписано Шангана. Стоит только инициал: П. Что же, отличный инициал,  говорит Джо. Так вот они и действуют,  говорит Гражданин.  Торговля следует за флагом. Да,  замечает Дж.Дж.,  если они ведут себя не лучше бельгийцев в Конго, хорошенькая там жизнь. Вы не читали этот доклад, кто же его написал Кейсмент[],  подсказывает Гражданин.  Он, кстати, ирландец. Да-да, он самый,  продолжает Дж.Дж.  Насилуют женщин, девушек, молотят туземцев по животам, видно, чтоб выжать из них весь красный каучук, какой можно. Знаю, куда он пошел,  вдруг говорит Ленехан и щелкает пальцами. Кто?  спрашиваю. Блум,  отвечает он.  Это все липа насчет суда. А он ставил на Рекламу и побежал сейчас загребать сребреники. Чего, этот белоглазый кафр[]?  Гражданин не верит.  Да он в жизни на лошадь не поставит, даже со злости. Нет, он туда пошел,  твердит свое Ленехан.  Я тут встретил Бэнтама Лайонса, он как раз на эту лошадку хотел ставить, только из-за меня раздумал и он сказал мне это Блум ему подкинул намек. На что хочешь бьюсь об заклад, он сейчас загребает сто шиллингов на свои пять. Единственный во всем Дублине кто сорвал куш. Поставил на темную лошадку. Сам он чертова темная лошадка,  ворчит Джо. Пропусти-ка, Джо,  говорю.  Где у нас тут вход на выход? Туда вон,  кивает Терри.Прощай, Ирландия, я еду в Горт. Значит выхожу я на задворки отлить и убей бог (сто шиллингов на пять) пока я там выпускал свой (Реклама-то взяла двадцать к) пока выпускал свой заряд я себе говорю я ж замечал ей-ей что его (две пинты от Джо и у Слэттри одна) его так и тянет куда-то смыться (сто шиллингов это же пять фунтов) а когда они жили в (темная лошадка) Сикун рассказывал как бывало сидят за картами а они представляются будто ребенок болен (ну сила не меньше галлона напрудил) и эта его вислозадая половина сообщает по внутреннему телефону мол ей лучше или там ей (ох!) весь план к тому чтоб он мог смыться в выгодную минуту с выигрышем а еще (как пузырь-то не лопнул) торгует без патента (ох!) Ирландия говорит моя нация (перр! пукпукпук!) нет уж их не переплюнешь этих чертовых (ага последний остаток) иерусалимских (уф!) рогачей.Одним словом, я возвращаюсь, а они все долдонят, и Джон Уайз рассказывает, это, мол, Блум подал идею шиннфейнерам, чтобы Гриффит в своей газете разоблачал всяческие махинации, подтасовки состава присяжных или там жульничества с налогами, и чтобы по всем странам посылали своих представителей, продвигать торговлю ирландскими товарами. Менять шило на мыло. Тут уж, я скажу вам, густой мрачок, если эта косоглазая рожа еще нам примется устраивать наши дела. Уж дайте нам по-нашему сдохнуть. Боже спаси Ирландию от этого жирного пройдохи и всех подобных ему. Мистер Блум и его шахер-махеры. А до него еще его папаша занимался мошенничеством, старый Мафусаил Блум, бизнесмен с большой дороги, отравился синильной кислотой, но только прежде всю страну завалил своим хламом, брильянтами на пенни пара. Ссуды по почте на удобных условиях. Любые суммы высылаются на основании расписки. Расстояние не ограничивается. Гарантий не требуется.Ни дать ни взять, собачка Ланти Макхейла, что каждому хвостиком виляет[]. Это истинный факт,  говорит Джон Уайз.  И вот вам человек, который про это может все рассказать, Мартин Каннингем.И точно, подкатывает муниципальный кэб, а в нем Мартин, Джек Пауэр и еще один тип, Крофтер то ли Крофтон, оранжист, получает пенсию от таможенного ведомства и при Блэкберне состоит, где ему платят за то,  или, может, Кроуфорд?  что он шляется по всей стране за казенный счет.Наши путники достигли постоялого двора и спешились на землю со своих скакунов. Гей, слуги!  вскричал один из прибывших, чья осанка тотчас изобличала предводителя.  Ленивые прохвосты! Сюда!И с этими словами он шумно принялся колотить рукояткою меча по открытой оконной решетке.На сей призыв немедля появился хозяин, на ходу подпоясывая свой плащ. Добрый вам вечер, милостивые господа!  проговорил он, угодливо кланяясь. Живей пошевеливайся, бездельник!  вскричал ему стучавший в окно.  Вели позаботиться о наших конях. А нам подай лучшего, что только найдется в твоей дыре, ибо, клянусь, добрый ужин не повредил бы нашим желудкам. Увы, добрые господа!  отвечал ему на это хозяин.  В моем нищем доме и в погребе и в кладовке хоть шаром покати. Право, совсем не знаю, что и предложить вашим милостям. Что это ты там мелешь?  вскричал при этих словах второй из прибывших, человек с весьма приятными и живыми чертами лица.  Так-то ты принимаешь королевских гонцов, толстопузый мошенник!Лицо хозяина изменилось во мгновение ока. Прошу вас, смилуйтесь, благородные рыцари!  смиренно взмолился он.  Коль скоро вы гонцы нашего короля (да оградит бог Его Величество!), у вас не будет нужды ни в чем. Клянусь, друзьям короля (да благословит бог Его Величество!) не придется поститься в моем доме. Так живо принимайся за дело!  воскликнул прежде молчавший путник, в ком вся наружность выдавала любителя хорошо поесть.  Чего там у тебя найдется для нас?Вновь низко кланяясь, хозяин ему отвечал: Не окажете ли вы честь, достойнейшие рыцари, моим паштетам из молодых голубей, бифштексам из оленины, седлу теленка, утке, зажаренной с румяным беконом, кабаньей голове с фисташками, чаше сладкого заварного крема, пудингу с рябиновым соком и кувшину старого рейнского? Гром и молния!  вскричал вопрошавший.  Вот это по мне! Фисташки! Ага!  рассмеялся путник с приятными чертами лица.  Нечего сказать, нищий дом и пустая кладовка! Он славный шутник, этот негодяй.Стало быть, входит Мартин и спрашивает, где Блум. Где ему быть?  отвечает Ленехан.  Обирает вдов и сирот. Правда это или нет,  спрашивает Джон Уайз,  то, что я рассказывал Гражданину про Блума и его связи с Шинн Фейн? Да, это правда,  говорит Мартин,  или, по крайней мере, так про него наушничают. Это кто же наушничает?  спрашивает Олф. Я,  отвечает Джо.  У меня шапка с наушниками. Но, в конце концов,  рассуждает Джон Уайз,  почему еврей не может любить свою родину точно так же, как и всякий другой? Отчего бы нет?  Дж.Дж. на это ему.  Если только он знает, где его родина[]. Он что, еврей или же он язычник или католик или методист или, черт дери, еще что-то?  Нед спрашивает.  Кто он такой вообще? Я вам не в обиду, Крофтон. Мы его не желаем,  говорит Крофтер, оранжист или пресвитерианец. Кто такой Джуниус[]?  говорит Дж.Дж. Он  отпавший еврей,  объясняет Мартин,  родом откуда-то из Венгрии, и это именно он придумал все планы насчет венгерской системы[]. У нас в муниципалитете про это знают. А он не родственник дантиста Блума?  спрашивает Джек Пауэр. Нет, просто однофамильцы,  Мартин ему.  Его настоящая фамилия Вираг. Фамилия отца его, который отравился. Он получил разрешение сменить фамилию, то есть не он, а еще отец. Тоже мне новый мессия для Ирландии!  говорит Гражданин.  Остров мудрецов и святых! Что же, они все еще ждут своего искупителя,  говорит Мартин.  В этом смысле и мы как они. Верно,  продолжает Дж.Дж.,  и про каждого новорожденного мужского пола они думают, что этот, может, и есть мессия. Так что у них, надо полагать, каждый еврей себе места не находит, пока не узнает, кем стал, отцом или матерью. Ждет, что ему вот-вот малец,  добавляет Ленехан. Мать честная,  вспоминает тут Нед,  видели бы вы Блума перед тем, как у него сын родился, тот, что умер потом. Помню, я его встретил на южном рынке, он там покупал детское писание, а дело-то еще было за полтора месяца до родов.     [],  говорит Дж.Дж. И это, по-вашему, мужчина?  Гражданин спрашивает. Интересно, он хоть разок сумел вообще задвинуть,  говорит Джо. Ну, как-никак, двое детей народилось,  Джек Пауэр на это. И кого ж он подозревает?  спрашивает Гражданин.Ей ей, в каждой шутке есть доля правды. Ни то ни се, сущий гермафродит, вот он кто. Сикун говорит в этом своем отеле он что ни месяц регулярно в постель головные боли как есть тебе баба с женским делом[]. Да знаете, что я скажу, если на то пошло? Одна бы польза была, если б ухватить вот такого вот недоноска за шкирку, да и шарахнуть в море к едрене Фанни. Оправданная мера самозащиты. А что, скажете, это по-человечески, огрести даровых пять фунтов и смыться, не поставивши людям хоть по единой пинте. Эх, господи благослови! Да тут не будет и блоху утопить. Вспомним про милосердие к ближним,  Мартин советует.  Но только где же он сам? Нам некогда дожидаться. Волк в овечьей шкуре, вот он кто есть,  говорит Гражданин.  Вираг из Венгрии! Агасфер, я бы его назвал! Проклятый богом. А у вас найдется минутка для краткого возлияния, Мартин?  Нед спрашивает. Если только одну,  отвечает тот.  Мы спешим уже. Порцию Джей-джей-си[]. А вы, Джек? Крофтон? Значит, три половинки, Терри. Святому Патрику надо бы снова высадиться в Балликинларе[] и взяться за наше обращение,  Гражданин заявляет,  после того как мы позволили вот таким запаскудить нашу страну. Ну, будем,  говорит Мартин и тянется, поторапливаясь, за своей кружкой.  Всем тут присутствующим да окажет бог свою милость. Аминь,  заключает Гражданин. Окажет-окажет, не сомневайтесь,  это Джо.И под звуки освященного колокольчика[] во главе с несущим распятие, за коим следовали псаломщики, кадилоносцы, ковчеженосцы, чтецы, привратники, дьяконы и иподьяконы, продвигалась священная процессия митрофорных аббатов, приоров, настоятелей, монахов и братии нищенствующих орденов: монахи Венедикта Нурсийского, картузианцы и камальдулы, цистерцианцы и оливетанцы, ораторианцы и валломброзанцы, братья августинцы, бригиттинцы, премонстранцы, сервиты, тринитарии и дети св.Петра Ноланского; и шли также с горы Кармел дочери и сыны пророка Илии, ведомые Альбертом епископом и Терезой Авильской, обутые, равно как и босые; и братья бурые и серые, сыны бедняка Франциска, капуцины, кордельеры, минимы и обсерванты и дочери Клары; и сыны Доминика, братья-проповедники, и сыны Винсента; и монахи св.Волстана; и Игнатия чада; и сообщество Христианских братьев, ведомых преподобным Эдмундом Игнатием Райсом. За ними же шествовали все святые и мученики, девы и исповедники: св.Кирик и св.Исидор Землепашец и св.Иаков, брат Господень, и св.Фока Синопский и св.Юлиан Странноприимец и св.Феликс Канталийский и св.Симеон Столпник и св.Стефан Первомученик и св.Иоанн Божий и св.Ферреол и св.Лигард и св.Феодот и св.Вульмар и св.Ричард и св.Винсент де Поль и св.Мартин из Тоди и св.Мартин Турский и св.Альфред и св.Иосиф и св.Дионисий и св.Корнилий и св.Леопольд и св.Бернард и св.Терентий и св.Эдуард и св.Оун Каникулус[] и св.Аноним и св.Эпоним и св.Псевдоним и св.Омоним и св.Пароним и св.Синоним и св.Лаврентий ОТул и св.Иаков Динглский и Компостельский и св.Колумциллий и св.Колумба и св.Целестин и св.Колман и св.Кевин и св.Брендан и св.Фригидиан и св.Сенан и св.Фахтна и св.Колумбан и св.Гэлл и св.Ферси и св.Финтан и св.Фиакр и св.Иоанн Непомук и св.Фома Аквинский и св.Ив Бретонский и св.Мичен и св.Герман-Иосиф и три святых покровителя отроков, св.Алоизий Гонзага и св.Станислав Костка и св.Иоанн Берхманс, и святые Гервасий, Сервасий и Бонифаций, и св.Брайд и св.Киран и св.Каниций Килкеннийский и св.Иарлат Туамский и св.Финбар и св.Паппин Баллимунский и брат Алоизий Миротворец и брат Людовик Ратоборец и свв.

И шествовали все они, осененные нимбами, венцами и славами, неся пальмовые ветви, арфы, мечи и венки из оливы, в ризах, на коих вытканы были священные символы их служения, чернильницы, стрелы, хлебы, кувшины, оковы, топоры, древа, мосты, младенцы в купели, раковины, сумы, ножницы, ключи, драконы, лилии, картечь, бороды, боровы, светильники, кузнечные мехи, пчелиные ульи, суповые ложки, звезды, змеи, наковальни, баночки с вазелином, колокольчики, костыли, хирургические щипцы, оленьи рога, резиновые сапоги, ястребы, жернова, глаза на блюде, восковые свечи, кропила, единороги. И покуда свершали они свой путь мимо колонны Нельсона, и по Генри-стрит, Мэри-стрит, Кейпл-стрит, Малой Бритн-стрит, распевая входной антифон на  [], что начинается с , [], и затем наисладчайший антифон степенный,  гласящий   [], творили они многоразличные чудеса, изгоняя бесов, воскрешая усопших, совершая умножение рыб, исцеляя расслабленных и слепых, обнаруживая всякого рода утерянные предметы, толкуя, а равно исполняя Писание, благословляя и пророчествуя. И заключал шествие под златотканым пологом преподобный отец ОФлинн, ему же сопутствовали Малахия и Патрик. А когда святые отцы достигли назначенного места, дома Бернарда Кирнана и Кь, с огр. отв., Малая Бритн-стрит, ,  и , оптовая торговля бакалейным товаром, винами и коньяками, с патентом на продажу пива, вина и крепких напитков распивочно, священник благословил дом и окадил окна его и переплеты окон и своды и перемычки сводов и выступы и капители и фронтоны и карнизы и зубчатые арки и шпили и куполы и окропил сочленения оных святою водой и вознес молитву, дабы Господь благословил дом сей, как благословил он дом Авраама, Исаака и Иакова, и ниспослал бы ангелов света Своего, дабы обитали в нем. И, вошед, благословил яства и пития, и весь сонм блаженных вторил его молитвам.     [].     [].  [].

Долгих вам лет, Лэмберт,  говорит этот Крофтон или Кроуфорд. Не против,  отвечает Нед, поднимая стаканчик виски.  Пилось бы да елось.Я поглядываю по сторонам, не придет ли кому-нибудь счастливая мысль, и тут, проклятье, опять он является, с таким видом, как будто спешил со всех ног. А я,  говорит,  только что был в суде, вас искал. Надеюсь, я не Нет-нет,  отвечает Мартин.  Мы готовы.В суде, говоришь, а ну в глаза посмотри, небось, от золота все карманы отвисли. Крохобор хренов, недоделок. Хоть по одной-то поставил бы. Куда, черта с два тебе! Вот они вам, жиды! Один профит знают. Нюх, как у крысы в нужнике. Сто на пять. Никому не рассказывай,  говорит Гражданин. Прошу прощения?  Блум ему. Пойдемте, пойдемте,  торопит Мартин, видя, что пахнет жареным.  Пора двигаться. Никому не рассказывай.  Гражданин повторяет и аж рычит от полноты чувства.  Держи в секрете.Псина тут просыпается и тоже издает рык. Ну, мы пошли, пока,  Мартин говорит.И поживей их выталкивает наружу, Джека Пауэра и Крофтона или как бишь его, и этого между ними посередке, а тот все прикидывается, будто ему невдомек, из-за чего сыр-бор, и все они залезают в свой хренов кэб. Пошел,  говорит Мартин кучеру.Гривой своей тряхнул дельфин белоснежный, и кормчий, встав на золоченой корме, направил вздувшийся парус по ветру. Стремительно полетела ладья на всех парусах, уставив спинакер по штирборту. Прекрасные нимфы всплывали во множестве по бакборту и по штирборту и, приближаясь к благородной ладье, смыкали с нею сияющие очертанья, как делает хитроумный мастер-колесник, прилаживая вокруг оси колеса равноотстоящие лучи, братья один другому, и огибая их ободом, и быстроту сообщая стопам мужей, спешат ли они на грозную сечу или состязаются ради улыбки прекрасных дам. И так, приплывая, располагались они, нимфы благосклонные, бессмертные сестры. И смеялись, резвясь в клубах белопенных, и резво взрезала волны ладья.Но тут, не успел я приземлить кружку на стол, как вижу, Гражданин подымается и прет, шатаясь, к дверям, сопя, раздувшись как от водянки, и изрыгает на того по-ирландски проклятие Кромвеля[] и большую анафему и все трехэтажные приветствия, плюется кругом как бешеный, а малыш Олф и Джо на нем повисли пиявками, пробуют удержать. Пустите меня,  ревет.И я не я буду, он-таки дополз до дверей, они его с боков держат, а он вдруг как заорет во всю глотку: Тройное ура Израилю!, сидел бы уж на парламентской стороне жопы[], не делал из себя посмешище всему городу. Ей-ей, всегда найдется кретин, который из-за куриного дерьма готов лезть в пузырь. Загадят тебе всю лавочку, пива пить не захочешь.А там у дверей уж все оборванцы и потаскухи с целого Дублина, Мартин дергает кучера, погоняй, Гражданин все орет, Джо с Олфом унимают его, а тот уже из кэба опять понес свою лекцию про евреев, зеваки его подзуживают, толкай речугу, Джек Пауэр тянет за рукав, чтобы язык придержал, один из ротозеев, кривой, на глазу повязка, горланит Если б вдруг на луну влез жид[], а какая-то шлюха вопит: Эй, кавалер! У тебя ширинка расстегнута! Кавалер!А тот вещает из кэба: Мендельсон был евреем и Карл Маркс и Меркаданте[] и Спиноза. Спаситель был еврей и отец его был еврей. Ваш же Бог. У него не было отца,  Мартин говорит.  Все, хватит, поехали. Чей Бог?  Гражданин спрашивает. Ну так дядюшка его был еврей,  тот свое.  Ваш Бог был еврей.Христос был еврей, как я.Гражданин при этих словах заныривает обратно в бар. Клянусь Богом,  рычит,  я этому жидку вышибу мозги за то, что треплет святое имя. Клянусь Богом, я ему устрою распятие. Где там была эта жестянка из-под печенья. Стой! Стой!  кричит Джо.Широкое, представительное общество, где были тысячи друзей и знакомых из Дублина и окрестностей, собралось, чтобы проститься с Надьяшагошем урамом Липоти Вирагом[], бывшим сотрудником гг. Александр Том и Кь, печатников Его Величества, по случаю отъезда его в дальний край, в Сажарминчборьюгуляш  Дугулаш[].Прощальная церемония, проходившая с большим оживлением, была отмечена теплотой и сердечностью. Свиток древнего ирландского пергамента, украшенный миниатюрами работы ирландских мастеров, был преподнесен именитому феноменологу от лица значительной части собравшихся, купно также и с другим даром, серебряным ларцом, искусные украшения которого, выполненные в стиле древних кельтских орнаментов, делают высшую честь создателям этого шедевра, гг. Джекоб [] Джекоб.Отъезжавшего гостя приветствовали дружной овацией, и многие из собравшихся не могли сдержать слез, когда оркестр из наших лучших волынщиков заиграл знакомое и родное Вернись в Эрин[], за исполнением чего сразу последовал Ракоци-марш. Костры, а также бочки с дегтем были зажжены в честь события повсюду вдоль линии побережья всех четырех морей, на вершинах холма Хоут, горы Трирок и горы Шугарлоф, на мысу Брэй-Хед, на горах Морн, Галти и Оке, на пиках Донегола и Сперрина, на горах Нэгл и Богра, на холмах Коннемары, на горах Макгилликадди-Рикс, на горах Оти, горе Берна и горе Блум. Под приветственные клики, сотрясшие, казалось, сам свод небес и вызвавшие ответный хор возгласов со стороны многочисленных единомышленников, усеявших отдаленные холмы Кембрии и Каледонии[], исполинский прогулочный корабль медленно отошел от пристани, и вслед ему полетели дары флоры, прощальные подношения представительниц прекрасного пола, собравшихся на берегу в большом числе. Меж тем как судно двигалось по реке в сопровождении целой флотилии барж, ему салютовали, приспустив флаги, Портовое управление и Таможня, примеру которых вскоре последовала электростанция на Голубятне. ,  !![] Он уехал, похитив наши сердца.Ей ей, его сам черт не остановил бы, пока он не заграбастал эту треклятую жестянку и с ней обратно, малыш Олф виснет сзади на нем, он орет как свинья резаная, спектакль почище чем в Королевском театре. А ну, где он, сейчас прикончу!Нед и Дж.Дж. покатываются от хохота. Потеха,  говорю.  Дайте-ка я поспею хоть к занавесу.Но тут, на счастье, кучер развернул, наконец, свою колымагу и давай нахлестывать. Эй-эй, Гражданин,  говорит Джо,  постой.Куда там, он руку уже заносит, и со всего размаху  шарах! Спасибо, что ему солнце било в глаза, а то бы наповал уложил. Засветил так примерно до графства Лонгфорд. Кобыла со страху рванула, паршивый кабысдох кинулся за кэбом как бешеный, народ кругом хохочет, вопит, а треклятая жестянка прыгает с грохотом по мостовой.Катастрофа была мгновенной и ужасающей по своим последствиям.Обсерватория в Дансинке зарегистрировала общим счетом одиннадцать толчков, каждый из них силой в пять баллов по шкале Меркалли, и сейсмических потрясений подобной силы не было отмечено на нашем острове с  года, даты восстания Шелкового Томаса. По всей видимости, эпицентр находился в той части столицы, которая охватывает квартал Инн-куэй и приход св.Мичена, занимая площадь сорок один акр[], два руда и один квадратный перч. Роскошные резиденции, расположенные в окрестности Дворца Правосудия, все были разрушены, а сам благородный чертог, где в момент катастрофы происходили важные юридические дебаты, превратился буквально в груду развалин, под коими, как можно опасаться, все находившиеся в здании оказались погребены заживо. Как явствует из свидетельств очевидцев, сейсмические волны сопровождались также сильнейшими атмосферными возмущениями, носившими характер циклона. Головной убор, принадлежавший, как было позднее установлено, достопочтенному секретарю королевского и мирового суда мистеру Джорджу Фотреллу, а также шелковый зонтик с золотой рукоятью, на которой нанесены были инициалы, герб и номер дома высокоученого и глубокоуважаемого сэра Фредерика Фолкинера, главного судьи Дублина и председателя квартальных сессий, были обнаружены поисковыми партиями в отдаленных пунктах нашего острова, а именно: первый из названных предметов  на третьей базальтовой колонне Проспекта Гигантов, второй же  погребенным на глубине одного фута и трех дюймов на прибрежной песчаной полосе бухты Хоулопен, у древних скал мыса Кинсейл. По свидетельствам других очевидцев, одновременно можно было наблюдать, как неизвестное тело необычайно крупных размеров, раскаленное добела, с невероятною скоростью пронеслось в атмосфере, описав сложную траекторию, пролегавшую в направлении запад-юго-запад. Выражения соболезнования и сочувствия поступали ежечасно со всех концов мира, и его святейшество папа милостиво и благосклонно повелел, дабы во всех кафедральных соборах всех епархий, находящихся в юрисдикции Святого Престола, была бы единовременно совершена служителями особая   [] в поминовение душ верных сынов церкви, ушедших от нас столь неожиданным образом.

Ей-ей, если бы этот лотерейный билет выпал ему по кумполу, уж он бы запомнил золотой кубок, по гроб жизни запомнил, но только, убей бог, Гражданина упекли бы тогда за оскорбление действием, а Джо  за соучастие и подстрекательство. Кучер спас ему жизнь тем, что понесся вскачь, это истинный факт, как то, что Моисея Бог сотворил. Скажете, нет? Убей бог, спас. И вдогонку, как из ушата, густая ругань. Угробил я его или как?  спрашивает.И как заорет своему вшивому псу: Ату его, ату, Гарри! Ату, милок!И что напоследок видим, это кэб заворачивает за угол, он там со своей овечьей башкой все разглагольствует да машет руками, а сукин сын несется вдогонку во всю прыть, уши назад, готов разодрать его на кусочки. Сто на пять! Но тут уж он заплатил за свое сполна, могу побожиться.И се, низошло сияние велие на них, и узрели они колесницу, и Он стоял в той колеснице и возносился на небо[]. И узрели они Его в колеснице, облаченного в сияние славы, одежды же его как солнце, прекрасного как луна и грозного, и в трепете не дерзали поднять глаза на него. И се, глас с небес, глаголющий: Илия! Илия! И Он отвечал воплем велиим: Авва! Адонаи! И узрели они Его, даже и самого Его, бен Блума Илию, посреди сонмов ангельских, возносящегося к сиянию славы под углом сорок пять градусов над пивной Доноху на Малой Грин-стрит, как ком навоза с лопаты[].Эпизод []Летний вечер уж начинал окутывать мир своей таинственной поволокой.Солнце клонилось к западу, и последние лучи, увы, столь быстротечного дня нежно медлили на прощанье, лаская гладь моря и песчаного пляжа, и гордый выступ старого Хоута, верно и вечно стерегущего воды залива, и скалы вдоль берега Сэндимаунта[], затянутые морской тиной, и, наконец, что всего важней, скромную церковку, откуда в вечерней тишине плыли звуки молитв, обращенных к той, которая чистым своим сиянием как вечный маяк светит людским сердцам, носимым по житейскому морю,  к Марии, Звезде Морей.Три девушки, три подруги, сидели на прибрежных скалах, наслаждаясь чудесным вечером и морским ветерком, несущим приятную, еще не холодящую свежесть. Уж сколько раз забирались они сюда, в свое излюбленное местечко, чтобы уютно потолковать под плеск искрящихся волн и обсудить разные девичьи дела,  Сисси Кэффри и Эди Бордмен с младенцем в колясочке, а также Томми и Джеки Кэффри, два кудрявых мальчугана в матросках и матросских шапочках, на которых было написано одно и то же название: КЕВ[]Беллайл. Ибо Томми и Джеки Кэффри были близнецы, каких-нибудь четырех лет от роду, большие шалуны и озорники, но при всем том очень милые и забавные мальчуганы с живыми веселыми мордашками. Они возились в песке со своими лопатками и ведерками, строили башни, как все детишки, играли в большой разноцветный мячик, и счастью их не было границ. Эди Бордмен меж тем укачивала в колясочке пухлощекого малыша, и юный джентльмен блаженно посапывал. Ему было всего одиннадцать месяцев и девять дней, совсем еще ползунок, но он уже понемножку лепетал первые подобия слов. Сисси Кэффри наклонилась над ним, чтобы пощекотать складочки на его пухленьком животике и крохотную ямочку на подбородке. А ну-ка, детка,  улыбнулась она ему,  скажи громко-громко: дайте мне водички.И он лепетал за ней: Ати ати диди.Сисси Кэффри нежно потормошила малютку, потому что она обожала детишек, терпеливее всех возилась с захворавшими крошками, и ни за что на свете нельзя было заставить Томми Кэффри принять касторку, если кто-то вместо Сисси попробует его взять за носик и посулить ему лакомую горбушку черного хлеба с патокой. Эта девушка так умела уговаривать! Но, можно ручаться, малютка Бордмен и вправду был очень мил, сущий херувимчик в слюнявчике. А Сисси Кэффри была вовсе не из породы спесивых красоток вроде Флоры Макфлимси[]. Получив от природы в дар золотое сердце, большие цыганские глаза с вечной смешинкой в них и губки, подобные спелым вишням, она неудержимо привлекала к себе. И Эди Бордмен вместе с нею смеялась лепету своего крошечного братишки.Но тут юный Томми и юный Джеки устроили между собой легкую перепалку.Мальчишки  всегда мальчишки, и наши близнецы нисколько не были исключением из этого бесспорного правила. Яблоком раздора явилась песочная крепость, которую выстроил юный Джеки, а юный Томми, полагая, что лучшее  враг хорошего, стремился внести в нее архитектурные усовершенствования в виде большого входа, такого, как в башне Мартелло. Томми был упорен, однако и Джеки был волевой натурой, и, верный старому изречению, что для каждого маленького ирландца его дом  его крепость, он ринулся на презренного соперника с таким пылом, что незадачливый узурпатор был вмиг повержен, а с ним  как то ни печально!  и сам предмет спора, крепость.Нужно ли говорить, что вопли побежденного Томми достигли бдительного слуха подруг. Томми, ну-ка поди сюда!  строго окликнула его сестра.  Скорей-скорей! А ты, Джеки, как не стыдно, зачем ты его повалил на грязный песок, бедняжку. Вот погоди, я тебе всыплю за это.Юный Томми, с глазами, полными слез, явился на ее зов, потому что слово старшей сестры было законом для близнецов. После пережитого злоключения он был в плачевном виде. Матроска и штанишки были у него сплошь в песке, но Сисси издавна владела искусством справляться с маленькими житейскими неприятностями, и уже через миг на его ладном костюмчике не осталось ни единой песчинки. Однако в голубых глазах еще стояли большие слезы, готовые излиться наружу, и поэтому она крепко поцеловала его, чтобы бобо прошло, и погрозила пальцем нехорошему Джеки, и сказала, что она еще задаст ему, и негодующе на него посмотрела. Противный озорник Джеки!  воскликнула она.Потом привлекла к себе маленького моряка и доверительно, тихонько спросила: А ты у нас кто? Ты у нас детка-конфетка? Скажи-ка нам,  вмешалась тут Эди Бордмен,  а кого ты больше всех любишь? Ты Сисси больше всех любишь? Не-е,  протянул, хныча, Томми. Тогда, значит, Эди?  спросила Сисси. Не-е,  тянул Томми. А я знаю,  сказала Эди без особого ликования, и ее близорукие глаза бросили хитрый взгляд.  Знаю, кого Томми больше всех любит, он Герти любит. Не-е,  тянул Томми, явно готовясь зареветь.Но Сисси быстрым материнским чутьем живо угадала, что тут неладно, и шепнула Эди, чтобы та отвела его за колясочку, где джентльмен не увидит, и присмотрела, чтобы он не замочил свои новые желтые башмачки.Но кто же такая Герти?[]Герти Макдауэлл сидела невдалеке от своих подруг, задумавшись и глядя куда-то вдаль. Самому пылкому воображению было бы не под силу нарисовать более прелестный образ ирландской девушки. Все знакомые в один голос объявляли ее красавицей, хотя и замечали порой, что она пошла больше в Гилтрапов, чем в Макдауэллов. У нее была изящная тоненькая фигурка, даже, пожалуй, хрупкая, хотя таблетки с железом, которые она начала принимать, весьма помогали ей (в отличие от пилюль Вдовы Велч), уменьшая те истечения, что раньше случались у нее, и снимая чувство разбитости.Восковая бледность ее лица, обладавшего чистотою слоновой кости, была почти неземной, однако губки в своем античном совершенстве заставляли вспомнить розовый бутон и лук Купидона. Ее руки с тонкими пальцами были словно из мрамора, пронизанного голубыми жилками, и такой белизны, какую только могли доставить лимонный сок и Крем Королевы, хотя это была злейшая выдумка, будто бы она надевала на ночь лайковые перчатки и мыла в молоке ноги. Однажды Берта Сапл наговорила это про нее Эди Бордмен, но она просто сочинила, потому что в то время была с Герти на ножах (конечно, и у наших подружек иногда случались свои маленькие размолвки, как у всех смертных) и еще она ей сказала чтобы та ни за что на свете не проговорилась кто ей рассказал а иначе она всю жизнь не будет с ней разговаривать. Нет уж.Каждому по заслугам. У Герти была врожденная утонченность, некая томная [], даже нечто царственное, в том не оставляли сомнений изящные линии ее рук и ножка с высоким подъемом. И если бы только ей выпал благой удел родиться в знатной семье и получить тонкое воспитание, Герти Макдауэлл без труда могла бы сравняться с любою из самых блестящих дам всей страны и увидеть себя в роскошном уборе, с диадемой на лбу, и сонмы высокородных поклонников ревниво оспаривали бы честь оказаться у ее ног. Может статься, именно это, возможная и несбывшаяся любовь, и было тому причиной, что ее нежные черты порой обретали какое-то напряженное выражение, исполненное тайного смысла, и ее дивные глаза туманились странной грустью, перед обаянием которой никто не мог устоять.Откуда их колдовская сила у женских глаз? У Герти они светились лазурнейшей ирландской лазурью, оттеняясь лучистыми ресницами и темными выразительными бровями. Однако некогда эти брови не были столь обольстительно шелковисты. Это мадам Вера Верайти[] со страниц своего Уголка Красоты в Новостях принцессы[] впервые дала ей совет попробовать краску для бровей, придающую вашему взгляду то загадочное выражение, что так нас чарует у цариц моды,  и Герти, приняв совет, никогда не сожалела об этом. Потом там еще было научное средство как перестать краснеть и каждая может стать высокой увеличьте ваш рост и ваше лицо прекрасно но как же носик? Последнее пригодилось бы миссис Дигнам, у той просто кнопка. Но главною славой Герти были ее роскошные волосы.Темно каштановые, слегка вьющиеся от природы. Она подрезала их как раз в то утро, по случаю новолуния, и они мириадами блестящих завитков обрамляли ее хорошенькую головку. Она подрезала заодно и ногти, это в четверг к богатству. И сейчас, когда от слов Эди ее щеки зажглись румянцем, легким и нежным, как лепестки роз, она была столь прелестна в своей милой девичьей застенчивости, что, можно смело ручаться, во всей богохранимой стране Ирландии ей бы не нашлось равной.Одно мгновение она еще сидела молча, грустно опустив взор. Она собиралась ответить, но что-то удержало слова, готовые сорваться с уст. Ее тянуло заговорить, однако достоинство ей подсказывало хранить молчание.Хорошенькие губки слегка надулись, но тут же она подняла глаза и рассмеялась веселым смехом, свежим, как юное утро мая. Она отлично знала, уж кому знать, почему эта косоглазая Эди сказала так: потому что он с виду охладел к ней, хотя на самом деле это было как милые бранятся. Как это всегда бывает, кой-кто себе места не находил, что этот парень, у которого велосипед, постоянно разъезжает у Герти под окнами. Но просто сейчас отец велел ему сидеть дома по вечерам и как следует заниматься, чтобы заработать награду на экзаменах, а потом, после школы, он хотел поступать в колледж Тринити учиться на доктора, как и его брат У.И.Уайли, который выступал на университетских велогонках. Быть может, его не очень-то занимало, что она чувствует, и он даже не подозревал, какая пустота и боль охватывали порой ее сердце, пронзая его до глубины. Но он был еще совсем юн и, как знать, со временем мог бы научиться ее любить. Он был из протестантской семьи, а Герти, конечно, знала, Кто шел первым, и за Ним  Пресвятая Дева, и дальше святой Иосиф[]. Но у него была эффектная внешность, это бесспорно, красивый правильный нос, и потом он был настоящим джентльменом во всем, до самых кончиков ногтей, уже форма головы выдавала что-то незаурядное, она всегда отличила бы, и особенно заметно сзади, когда он без шапки, и потом, он так ловко, не держась за руль, разворачивал свой велосипед у фонарного столба, и его дорогие сигареты так хорошо пахли, и еще они очень подходили друг другу по росту, и вот потому Эди Бордмен и думала, что она такая умная, потому что перед ее жалким садиком он что-то не собирался разъезжать.Одета была Герти просто, но с безошибочным вкусом, каким владеют верные слуги Ее Величества Моды, потому что у нее было такое чувство, как будто есть крохотный шанс сегодня встретить его. Изящная блузка цвета электрик, которую она сама покрасила лучшей патентованной краской (когда Дамский Иллюстрированный предсказал[], что электрик скоро войдет в моду), с эффектным узким вырезом до ложбинки и с кармашком для платка (но платок портил бы линию, и Герти всегда там держала ватку, надушенную своими любимыми духами), и темно-голубая расклешенная юбка длиной три четверти чудесно обрисовывали ее гибкую грациозную фигурку. На ней была премиленькая кокетливая шляпка из черной соломки крупного плетения, контрастно окаймленная понизу синей и канареечной синелью, а сбоку украшенная бантиком тех же цветов. За этим сочетанием синели она охотилась в прошлый вторник целых полдня, пока наконец не нашла на летней распродаже у Клери в точности то, что нужно, шнур успел в магазине чуточку залосниться, но на вид совершенно незаметно, по два шиллинга один пенс за локоть. Потом она это все приладила своими руками, и сколько радости было, когда она впервые примерила ее и улыбнулась прелестному отражению, которое увидела в зеркальце! И, натягивая ее на большую кружку, чтобы не потеряла формы, она уже твердо знала, что скоро некоторым знакомым придется сбавить свой гонор. Ее туфельки были последней новинкой моды (Эди Бордмен страшно гордилась, что у нее совсем , но такой ножки, как у Герти, тридцать третьего, у ней не было и не будет, сколько свет простоит), с носками из натуральной кожи и с единственной очень эффектной пряжкой на высоком изогнутом подъеме. Ее юбка открывала точеные щиколотки безупречной формы, а стройные икры, обтянутые тонким чулком с уплотненной пяткой и широкими отворотами для подвязок, виднелись ровно настолько, насколько следует. Что же до белья, то о нем Герти заботилась больше всего, и у кого из тех, кому ведомы трепетные надежды и опасения нежных семнадцати лет (хотя своим семнадцати Герти уже сказала прости), достанет жестокосердия ее упрекнуть в этом? У нее были четыре фасонных гарнитура с дивной кружевной отделкой, каждый из трех предметов плюс ночная сорочка, и причем ленточки у всех разного цвета, розового, голубого, сиреневого и салатного, и когда получала из прачечной она всегда их сама просушивала и подсинивала и гладила у нее такой был кирпичик на чем ставить утюг потому что этим прачкам она нисколько не доверяла насмотревшись как они портят вещи. Она надела голубое на счастье, надеясь наперекор всему, это был ее цвет и еще это счастливый цвет для невесты, если на ней есть где-нибудь голубое потому что когда она надела в тот день зеленое то вышло к несчастью потому что отец засадил его дома заниматься ради этой награды и потому что она подумала может быть сегодня он все-таки выйдет потому что когда она одевалась утром она чуть было не надела эти старенькие наизнанку а это как раз к счастью и к встрече любящих если ты это наденешь наизнанку только чтобы день был не пятница.И однако! однако! Это напряженное выражение лица! Как будто тайная грусть неотступно гложет его. Вся ее душа видна у нее в глазах, и, кажется, она бы отдала все на свете, чтобы очутиться сейчас одной, в укромной тишине своей комнатки, и, давши волю слезам, не сдерживая томящих чувств, выплакаться как следует, но только, конечно, не чересчур потому что она училась перед зеркалом как плакать красиво. И зеркальце сказало, о, Герти, ты мила[]. Гаснущий отблеск дня освещает ее лицо, невыразимо печальное и задумчивое. Напрасно томится Герти Макдауэлл. Да, она с самого начала знала, что ее мечтам о замужестве не суждено сбыться, и не трезвонить колоколам на свадьбе миссис Регги Уайли, К.Т.Д.[](потому что миссис Уайли будет та, на ком женится старший брат), и в светской хронике не появиться строкам о том, что миссис Гертруда Уайли была в эффектном туалете серых тонов с роскошной меховой отделкой из голубого песца. Он слишком молод, чтобы понять. Едва ли он способен верить в любовь, это удел женщины. В тот давний вечер, на празднике у Сторов (он еще тогда ходил в коротких штанишках), когда они оказались одни, он воровато обнял ее за талию, и она вся побелела как мел.Изменившимся, странно охрипшим голосом он назвал ее малышкой и торопливо, еле скользнув губами, поцеловал (ее первый поцелуй!), но это получилось один только кончик носа, и тут же он заспешил из комнаты, бормоча что-то насчет закусок. Какой-то взбалмошный! Сила характера никогда не была сильной стороной Регги Уайли, а тот, кто сумел бы покорить и увлечь Герти Макдауэлл, уж конечно должен быть настоящим мужчиной. Вот только ждать, постоянно ждать, пока на тебя обратят внимание, а тут как раз високосный год[], который, не успеешь оглянуться, пройдет. Нет, ее идеал возлюбленного  не прекрасный принц, приносящий к ее ногам дивный и редкостный дар своей любви, скорей это закаленный мужчина, невозмутимый и сильный, которому не посчастливилось встретить свой идеал, может быть, у него на висках уже блестит седина, и он бы понял ее, надежно укрыл бы ее в своих объятиях, привлек бы ее к себе со всею силой своей глубоко страстной натуры и прильнул бы к ее устам долгим, нескончаемым поцелуем. Это было бы что-то райское. Вот о ком затаенно мечтает она в этот летний задумчивый вечер.Всем сердцем своим она жаждет стать его единственной, его нареченной невестой в бедности и в богатстве, в немощах и в здоровье, покуда смерть не разлучит нас, и да будет впредь по сему[].И пока Эди Бордмен возилась за колясочкой с маленьким Томми, она как раз думала о том, придет ли завтрашний день, когда она сможет назвать себя его будущей женушкой. Вот уж тогда пускай они судачат про нее хоть до одури, и Берта Сапл, и Эди, которая такая злючка потому что ей в ноябре стукнет уже двадцать два. Она бы заботилась о нем, создала бы ему все мыслимые удобства, потому что Герти, не обделенная женской мудростью, хорошо понимала, что всякий мужчина любит у себя в доме уют. Ее оладьи, доведенные до золотисто-коричневого цвета, и пудинг королевы Анны, хранящий вкус и аромат свежих сливок, всегда вызывали шумные похвалы потому что у нее была легкая рука зажигать огонь, значит засыпаешь тонкую муку с сухими дрожжами и помешиваешь все время в одном направлении, потом молоко и сахар и хорошо взбитые белки хотя когда доходило до еды она не любила стеснялась при людях и думала как жаль что нельзя питаться чем-нибудь таким поэтическим фиалками или розами и она бы чудно обставила их гостиную там были бы всякие картины гравюры и фотография Гарриоуна собачки дедушки Гилтрапа она почти была как человек казалось вот-вот заговорит и на стульях покрышки из узорной набойки и серебряный тостер какие бывают в богатых домах она видела такой на распродаже у Клери. Он будет высокий, широкоплечий (она всегда мечтала, чтобы муж был высокий), с белозубой улыбкой под красиво подстриженными усами, и они поедут на континент, чтобы там провести свой медовый месяц (три упоительные недели!), а потом, когда они устроят себе уютное гнездышко, такой маленький миленький домик, то каждое утро будут завтракать вместе, это будет простой, но безупречно сервированный завтрак, только на две их персоны, больше ни для кого, и уходя на службу он крепко обнимет свою милую женушку и на минуту глянет в самую глубину ее глаз.Эди Бордмен спросила у Томми Кэффри, все ли он сделал, он сказал да, тогда она застегнула ему штанишки и сказала, чтобы он бежал играть с Джеки, только пусть они оба будут теперь хорошие и не ссорятся. Но Томми сказал, что он хочет мячик, а Эди ответила нельзя, с мячиком играет малютка и если у него забрать, начнется сразу концерт, но Томми сказал нет, это его мячик, и он хочет свой мячик, и топнул ножкой. Нет, вы подумайте! Ну и характер! Да, он уже был мужчиной, этот маленький Томми, едва выйдя из пеленок. Но Эди ему ответила нет, нет и нет, и чтобы он прекратил, и сказала Сисси, чтобы та не уступала ему. А ты мне не сестра,  заявил неслух Томми.  Хочу мой мячик.Но тут Сисси Кэффри сказала малютке Бордмену посмотри-ка сюда, посмотри на мой пальчик, и быстрым движением подхватила мяч. Она катнула его по песку, и Томми, одержав победу, со всех ног пустился за ним. Главное, чтобы было тихо,  засмеялась Сисси.Она пощекотала крошке его пухлые щечки, чтобы он поскорей забыл, и принялась с ним играть в сорока-ворона кашку варила, деток кормила, этому дала, и этому дала, и этому дала, и этому дала, а самому маленькому не дала. Но тут Эди расшипелась, что вот так он вечно и вытворяет, что ему вздумается, раз все его балуют без конца. Вот погодите,  посулила она,  я еще ему всыплю по одному месту. Ата-та по попке,  весело рассмеялась Сисси.Герти низко опустила голову и густо покраснела, подумав, что Сисси употребляет недопустимые для барышни выражения, каких она сама не произнесла бы ни за что на свете, лучше сгорела бы со стыда, она вся залилась горячим румянцем, а Эди Бордмен сказала, что джентльмен поблизости наверняка все слышал. Но Сисси это не волновало ни на мизинец. Ну и пускай!  воскликнула она, тряхнув беззаботно головой и озорно сморщив носик.  Можно заодно и ему по тому же месту. У меня это быстро.Шальная Сисе с негритянскими кудряшками. Бывает, с ней обхохочешься.Например, скажет, ты выпей лимонаду а я таю с чортом, или нарисует красным на своих ноготках, на одном  кружку, на другом  мужскую физиономию, все, конечно, покатываются, или когда ей захочется в одно место, объявит вдруг, я должна нанести визит мисс Писс. Вот такая вот она вся, Сиссикумс. Ой, а разве забыть тот вечер, когда она напялила на себя отцовский костюм и шляпу, подрисовала жженой пробкой усы и с сигареткой пошла разгуливать по Трайтонвилл-роуд[]! По части шуток и розыгрышей за ней никому не угнаться.Но при всем том  чистейшая искренность, одно из самых смелых и верных сердец, какие Бог сотворил, не из тех двуличных созданий, что чересчур деликатны для прямоты.Здесь в воздухе разнеслись звуки пения и органного гимна. То совершались молитва, проповедь и освящение Святых Даров в приюте трезвости для мужчин, которым руководил миссионер, преподобный Джон Хьюз, О.И. Там они собирались вместе, без всякого различия сословий (и это было весьма поучительное зрелище), ибо все они были вынесены мирскими бурями в сей скромный храм на берегу волн, и все, припадая к стопам Непорочной, читали молитву Божией Матери Лоретской, просили ее заступничества, обращая к ней древние, такие знакомые слова, пресвятая Мария, пресвятая и пречистая дева. Какую печаль несли эти звуки бедняжке Герти! Если б только ее отец вырвался из когтей зеленого змия, с помощью ли обета или тех порошков, исцеляющих от страсти к вину, про которые было в Пирсонс уикли, она бы разъезжала сейчас в своей собственной карете не хуже кого угодно. Она повторяла это себе несчетное число раз, сидя в грустной задумчивости у догорающего камина, не зажигая огня, потому что она терпеть не могла двойной свет, или мечтательно размышляя по целым часам, глядя из окошка на то, как дождь колотит в ржавый мусорный бак. Но гнусное зелье, разбившее столько очагов, столько семей, бросило мрачную тень на ее детские годы.Шутка сказать, ей даже довелось повидать в своем доме буйства, чинимые от невоздержности, и быть свидетельницей тому, как ее собственный отец, распаляемый губительными парами, совершенно забывал себя, ибо тверже всего на свете Герти знала одно: если мужчина когда-нибудь посмеет коснуться женщины иначе нежели с добротой и лаской, он достоин звания самого низкого негодяя[].Голоса продолжали петь, воссылая молитвы Деве Всемогущей, Всеблагой Деве. А Герти, погруженная в свои думы, словно не слышала и не видела ни своих подружек, ни резвящихся близнецов, ни джентльмена, который появился со стороны Сэндимаунт Грин,  Сисси нашла, что он очень похож на отца,  и совершал небольшую прогулку вдоль берега. Конечно, на людях его никогда не увидишь навеселе, но все равно он ей не нравился как отец, может, из-за того, что был слишком стар, или еще почему-нибудь, а может, из-за лица (словом, тут явно был случай доктора Фелла[]), или же угреватого, бугристого носа, или рыжих усов, уже побелевших под носом. Бедный папа! Она его любила при всех его грехах[] и ей нравилось когда он пел О, Мэри, скажи, как тебя покорить и Мой домик и любовь моя вблизи от Ла Рошели и на ужин были тушеные моллюски и салат под майонезом и когда он пел Взошла луна с мистером Дигнамом, который так внезапно умер и уже схоронили, помилуй, Господи, его душу, от удара. Это было в день рождения мамы, Чарли был дома на каникулах, и Том, и мистер Дигнам с женой, и Пэтси и Фредди Дигнам, и они все вместе сфотографировались. Кто бы подумал, что конец уже так близко. А сейчас он в могиле. А мама ему сказала что пусть это ему послужит предупреждением до конца его дней а он даже не смог пойти на похороны из-за своей подагры и ей пришлось сходить в город принести ему с работы письма и образцы линолеума Кэтсби, художественный рисунок, годится хоть для дворца, высокая прочность, и в доме всегда ярко и весело.Герти была не дочка, а просто сокровище, вторая мать всей семье, помощница и ангел-хранитель, золотое сердечко. Когда у матери случались эти ужасные мигрени, такие, что голова раскалывалась, кто как не Герти всегда натирала ей лоб ментоловой свечкой, хоть ей и не нравилось, что мать нюхает табак, это было одно-единственное, из-за чего у них выходили споры, нюхать табак. Все неустанно ее хвалили за ее милое обхождение.Именно Герти всегда отключала газ на ночь, и Герти же повесила на стенке в одном местечке, где она никогда не забывала посыпать хлоркой каждые две недели, календарь с картиной В идиллические времена, что им подарил мистер Танни, бакалейщик. На этой картине молодой джентльмен, одетый по-старинному, в треуголке, протягивал своей возлюбленной даме букет цветов через решетку ее окна, со всей галантностью того давнего времени.Сразу ясно, что за этим какая-то история. И как приятно подобраны краски!Она в белом из облегающей мягкой ткани, и поза самая изысканная, а кавалер в наряде шоколадного цвета и выглядит аристократом до кончиков ногтей. И часто, заходя туда кой-зачем, она мечтательно глядела на них и, засучив слегка рукава, трогала свои руки, такие же белые и мягкие как у той и размышляла о тех временах потому что она нашла в словаре произношения Уокера который остался от дедушки Гилтрапа что это значит идиллический.Близнецы теперь играли вполне по-братски, самым похвальным образом, до тех пор, пока юный Джеки, который и в самом деле был отчаянный озорун, от этого никуда не денешься, нарочно не наподдал мячик изо всех сил в сторону затянутых тиной скал. Само собой ясно, что бедный Томми выказал бурное огорчение, но, к счастью, джентльмен в черном, сидевший там в одиночестве, отважно ринулся на выручку и поймал мяч. Оба соперника с истошными воплями тут же принялись требовать любимую игрушку и чтобы выйти из положения, Сисси Кэффри обратилась к джентльмену, бросьте его мне, пожалуйста.Джентльмен примерился раз-другой и метнул его по песку в сторону Сисси, но он откатился под уклон и остановился у маленькой лужицы под скалой, в точности подле юбки Герти. Близнецы немедля возобновили свои требования, и Сисси попросила ее стукнуть его к ним и пусть они ловят, кто поймает, так что Герти отвела ножку но она предпочла бы чтоб этот их глупый мяч не закатывался к ней и попыталась ударить по нему но промазала, а Эди и Сисси рассмеялись. Раз не вышло, пробуй снова[],  сказала Эди Бордмен.Герти улыбнулась в знак согласия и закусила губку. Ее нежные щеки порозовели, однако она твердо решила им показать и потому приподняла чуть-чуть юбку, немножко, но так, чтобы не мешала, и, хорошенько прицелившись, лихо наподдала ножкой по мячу, так что тот отлетел далеко-далеко, а оба близнеца припустились за ним по гальке. Конечно, это была чистейшая ревность, только чтобы привлечь внимание джентльмена, наблюдавшего неподалеку. Она почувствовала, как жаркий румянец прихлынул и заполыхал на ее щеках, а это всегда был опасный знак у Герти Макдауэлл.Покамест они лишь мельком поглядывали друг на друга, но сейчас она рискнула посмотреть пристальней из-под полей новой шляпы, и ей показалось, что она в жизни своей не видела такого печального лица какое-то странно вытянутое, вымотанное, что встретил ее взор в подступающих сумерках.Благоухания струились через раскрытые окна церкви, и вместе с ними благоуханные имена той, что была зачата неоскверненно[], ковчег духовный, молись за нас, ковчег поклонения, молись за нас, ковчег благочестия несказанного, молись за нас, о роза таиАнственная[]. И были там заботой снедаемые сердца, и труждающиеся ради хлеба насущного, и многие, что блуждали и заблуждались, глаза же их были увлажнены раскаянием, но купно и светились надеждой, ибо поведал им преподобный отец Хьюз то, что сказал Бернард, великий святой, в своей прославленной молитве к Матери Божией: что дарована Приснодеве всякая власть предстательская, и не слыхано от века никем, чтобы она оставила без участия вопиющих к ней.Близнецы снова безмятежно резвились, ибо в детстве огорчения наши мимолетны, как летний дождик. Сисси все играла с малюткой Бордменом, и тот агукал от удовольствия, поводя в воздухе ручонками. Тик-ток! подавала она голос, спрятавшись за верхом коляски, и Эди спрашивала, а куда делась Сисси, и тогда она вдруг выглядывала и восклицала: ку-ку! а мальчуганчик, я вам ручаюсь, весь расплывался от восторга. Потом она стала просить его: скажи папа. Ну скажи папа, маленький. Скажи па-па-па-па-па-па-па.И тот старался вовсю, потому что, все говорили, для своих одиннадцати месяцев он был просто необычайно развит, и притом крупный, здоровенький, прямо на загляденье, такой тебе крошка-очаровашка, и все в один голос предсказывали, что из него вырастет какой-нибудь великий человек. Аля-ля-ля-аля.Сисси утерла ему ротик слюнявчиком и хотела его усадить по-настоящему и чтобы он говорил па-па-па, но едва она его развернула, она так и ахнула, святой Дионисий, да он же мокрый, хоть выжимай, надо скорей перевернуть под ним двойную пеленку другой стороной. Разумеется, эти формальности туалета вызвали досаду и недовольство его младенческого величества, о чем они и довели до общего сведения: Уааа куаакуаакуаа уаа.И две большие круглые симпатичные слезинки покатились вниз по его щекам. Тут было бесполезно утешать, ну что ты, что ты, малыш, или начинать про всяких там гав-гав и му-му, но Сисси, как всегда, моментально сообразив, сунула ему в рот бутылочку с соской, и маленький язычник вскоре затих.Герти нестерпимо хотелось, чтобы они забрали поскорей домой своего писклявого младенца, не действовал бы на нервы, и вообще ему уже поздно, а заодно и этих сопливых близнецов. Взор ее устремлен был в морскую даль.Она ей напоминала картины, которые уличный художник рисовал цветными мелками на мостовой и было ужасно жаль что они там останутся и сотрутся, вечер, и плывущие облака и маяк Бейли на мысу, а ты сидишь так вот и слушаешь музыку и доносится аромат это они там ладан жгут в церкви. Но, между тем как она глядела вдаль, сердечко ее так и колотилось. Да, это именно на нее он смотрел, и притом таким особенным взглядом. Его глаза жгли ее, словно хотели проникнуть в самую глубину, прочесть, что у ней в душе. Они были чудесны, эти глаза, они были несказанно выразительны, только можно ли довериться им? Люди бывают такие странные. Она сразу поняла, что он иностранец, по его темным глазам и интеллигентному бледному лицу, живая копия ее фотографии Мартина Харви[], самого модного актера, если не считать усов но они ей всегда нравились потому что она не была так помешана на театре как Уинни Риппингам та даже предлагала чтобы они с ней одинаково одевались[] потому что по пьесе но только с ее места было не видно какой у него нос, орлиный или же слегка [].Он был в глубоком трауре, это она увидела сразу, и на лице у него читалась повесть печали и мук. Она бы отдала все на свете за то, чтобы узнать их причину. Его взгляд был таким настойчивым, неотрывным, и он видел как она стукнула по мячу так что мог бы наверно заметить и блестящие пряжки на туфельках если она ими будет задумчиво покачивать вот так вниз носочком.Она была рада, что утром чутье подсказало ей надеть эти прозрачные чулки, тогда ее мысль была что может быть она встретит Регги Уайли, но сейчас все это уже в прошлом. Перед нею явился тот, о котором она столько мечтала. Он и только он имел значение и на ее лице была радость потому что она жаждала его потому что она чувствовала всей душой что он и есть ее неповторимый, единственный. Всем своим сердцем девушки-женщины она стремилась к нему, суженому супругу ее мечтаний, потому что с первого взгляда она уже знала, что это он. И если он страдал, перед другими не был грешен[], но лишь другие перед ним, и если бы даже наоборот, если бы даже он сам прежде был грешник, дурной человек, это ее не остановило бы. Если даже он протестант или методист; все равно, она его легко обратит, если только он по-настоящему ее любит. Бывают раны, которые исцелит один сердечный бальзам. Она была настоящей женщиной, не то что теперешние ветреницы без капли женственности, каких он, наверно, знал, как эти велосипедистки, у которых все напоказ, чего у них нет, и она сгорала от жажды все узнать, все простить, если бы только она сумела так сделать, чтобы он полюбил ее и воспоминания утратили власть[]. И тогда, может статься, он бы нежно обнял ее, и как настоящий мужчина, до боли крепко стиснул бы ее гибкий стан, и любил бы ее лишь ради нее самой, единственную свою девочку.Прибежище грешников[]. Всех скорбящих радость.   []. Как хорошо это сказано, что тот, кто молится ей с верою и усердием, никогда не будет оставлен или отвергнут; и как хорошо подходит, что она гавань и прибежище для скорбящих потому что у нее у самой сердце пронзили семь скорбей. Герти живо представляла себе всю сцену в церкви, светящиеся витражи в окнах, свечи, цветы и голубые хоругви братства Пресвятой Девы, а в алтаре отец Конрой помогает канонику ОХанлону, уносит и приносит разные вещи, опустив глаза долу. Он выглядел почти как святой, в его исповедальне всегда было так чисто спокойно и мягкий сумрак и его руки будто из белого воска, а если когда-нибудь она станет доминиканской монахиней в этом их белом одеянии то может он приходил бы к ней в монастырь в новену святого Доминика. В тот раз, когда она сказала ему на исповеди, что у нее это самое, и покраснела до корней волос, боясь, что сейчас он посмотрит на нее, он ей ответил, чтобы она не беспокоилась, это просто голос природы и сказал мы все подчиняемся ее законам в нашей земной жизни и греха в этом нет потому что это исходит от женского естества каким его сотворил Господь, так он сказал, и даже наша Владычица сказала архангелу Гавриилу, да будет со мною по Слову Твоему. Он был такой благостный, такой добрый, что ей очень часто хотелось сделать ему какой-то подарок, может быть, покрышку на чайник, с рюшиками, и вышить на ней цветы, или часы, хотя часы у них есть, она их видела на каминной полке белые с золотом а сверху маленький домик откуда выскакивала каждые полчаса птичка и звонко выкрикивала она зашла в тот день насчет цветов для сорокачасового поклонения потому что это же трудно выбрать подарок может быть альбом с видами Дублина или каких-то еще мест.Невыносимые сорванцы-близнецы опять затеяли склоку, Джеки запустил мячом в сторону моря, и оба они помчались за ним. Мартышки несчастные, надоели как лужи осенью. Давно уж пора, чтобы кто-нибудь хорошенько их проучил. Эди и Сисси тут же принялись кричать им вслед, чтобы они вернулись, перепугавшись, что нахлынет прилив и они утонут. Джеки! Томми!И не подумали! Такие умники стали! Тогда Сисси объявила, что это последний раз в жизни она их взяла гулять. Она вскочила и, продолжая их окликать, устремилась за ними под уклон, откидывая на бегу свои волосы, по цвету они у ней были ничего, только если бы еще подлинней но хотя она в них чего-чего ни втирала не станем уж уточнять они ни чуточки не росли потому что такие есть так что ей одно оставалось делать самой авансы. Она бежала, по-журавлиному вымахивая ногами, странно как юбка не лопалась, в ней масса была мальчишеского, в Сисси Кэффри, и притом она никогда не упускала случая пофорсить а уж тут она знала что бегает как никто потому и проявила такую прыть чтобы он увидал как у нее подол нижней юбки развевается на бегу да голенастые ноги оголяются выше границ приличия.Просто очень было бы поделом, если бы вот сейчас она зацепилась за что-нибудь этими высоченными гнутыми французскими каблуками, все хочет повыше быть, да шлепнулась в землю носом. ![] Дивное зрелище, мужчине есть на что посмотреть.Царица ангелов[], царица патриархов, царица пророков и всех святых, так молились они, царица трисвятейшего вертограда, а потом отец Конрой передал кадило канонику ОХанлону и тот, положив туда ладан, окадил Святые Дары, а Сисси Кэффри изловила близнецов, и руки у нее так и чесались хорошенько надрать им уши но она не стала потому что думала может он на нее смотрит только на этот счет она очень глубоко ошибалась потому что Герти даже не глядя видела как он не сводил с нее глаз а потом каноник ОХанлон снова отдал кадило отцу Конрою и стал на колени глядя кверху на Святые Дары и хор запел   и она стала покачивать ногой в такт музыке, тантумер госа крамен тум[].Три шиллинга и одиннадцать пенсов она отдала за эти чулки у Спэрроу на Джордж-стрит это было во вторник нет в понедельник на Страстной и до сих пор все петли целы вот он на что смотрел, прозрачные, а вовсе не на ее замухрышные там ни тела ни линии (какая нахалка!) он же не слепой сам как-нибудь видит разницу.Сисси поднималась с моря с двумя близнецами и с мячиком и, таща за собой мальчишек, выглядела под стать любой стрил[], шляпка у нее от бега съехала набок, тонкая блузка, купленная всего полмесяца назад, превратилась чуть ли не в тряпку, и для полноты картины сзади торчала нижняя юбка, как рисуют на карикатурах. И вот тут Герти сняла на миг свою шляпу, чтобы поправить волосы. Истинный бог, более изящной, очаровательной головки не красовалось никогда на девичьих плечиках, маленькое сияющее диво, способное свести с ума своей нежной прелестью. Долго пришлось бы постранствовать по свету, чтобы отыскать что-либо подобное роскоши этих ореховых локонов. Она почти уловила, как быстрая искорка восхищения ответно вспыхнула у него в глазах, и от этого все струнки в ней затрепетали и напряглись. Она снова надела шляпу, опустив поля настолько, чтобы из-под них можно было наблюдать, и ножка, посверкивая пряжкой, стала покачиваться чуть быстрей, потому что дыхание у Герти перехватило, когда она перехватила это выражение в его глазах. Он смотрел на нее так, как смотрит удав на свою жертву. Женский инстинкт подсказывал ей, что она разбудила в нем дьявола, и при этой мысли горячая алость начала подниматься от ее шеи ко лбу, пока все личико не сделалось пунцовее розы.Это не укрылось от Эди Бордмен, потому что она все время косилась на Герти, с кривой улыбочкой, в очках, как старой деве положено, а сама делала вид как будто баюкает малыша. Настырней всякого комара, такая она и была и будет, вот потому с ней никто и не мог поладить, потому что она вечно суется не в свое дело. И Эди сказала Герти: Интересненько, что это у тебя на уме. Что?  отвечала Герти с улыбкой, приоткрывшей белые зубки.  Я просто подумала, что уже поздновато.Потому что она не чаяла дождаться, когда наконец эти сопливые близнецы, а заодно и младенец, уберутся подобру-поздорову, поэтому она и намекнула вежливо, что уже поздновато. И когда Сисси вернулась к ним, Эди спросила у нее, который час, а мисс Сисе, что за словом в карман не лезет, ответила без пяти поцелуев час целоваться. Но Эди непременно хотела знать, потому что им наказали быть пораньше. Погоди тогда,  сказала ей Сисси,  сбегаю спрошу у своего дядюшки Питера, который вон там торчит, сколько на его луковице.И она направилась к нему, а когда он увидел, как она подходит, то Герти заметила, что он вытащил руку из кармана, как-то занервничал и стал поигрывать часовой цепочкой и разглядывать церковь. Да, у него была страстная натура, но при этом, как теперь Герти видела, он потрясающе владел собой. Только что он был весь под ее обаянием, глаз от нее не мог оторвать  и вот, в один миг, перед вами серьезнейший джентльмен, и каждая черточка его солидной фигуры выражает полное самообладание.Сисси попросила ее извинить, и не будет ли он так добр сказать ей точное время, и Герти видела, как он достает часы, подносит их к уху, потом поднимает глаза и, кашлянув, говорит, что, к величайшему его сожалению, часы у него остановились, но он полагает, сейчас уже больше восьми, потому что солнце зашло. Он говорил с очень культурными интонациями, размеренным голосом, но, несмотря на это, словно какая-то дрожь проскальзывала в мягком звучании его речи. Сисси сказала спасибо и, вернувшись обратно, высунула им язык и объявила, дядюшка говорит, его луковица слегка протухла.Потом они запели второй стих из   и каноник ОХанлон снова поднялся и окадил Святые Дары и стал на колени, и тут он сказал отцу Конрою, что от одной из свечек вот-вот могут загореться цветы и отец Конрой поднялся и поправил цветы и свечу и она видела как джентльмен заводит свои часы и прислушивается идут ли они и она снова стала покачивать ножкой в такт музыке. Уже темнело, но все-таки ему еще было видно, и он, не отрываясь, смотрел все время пока заводил часы или что там он с ними делал а потом он положил их назад и снова сунул руки в карманы.Она почувствовала некое ощущение во всем теле: покалывало кожу на голове, планшетки корсета раздражали, и она знала что у нее начинается потому что в последний раз это было тоже когда она подрезала волосы в новолуние. Его темные глаза, снова прикованные к ней, впивали все ее очертания, поклонялись ей как божеству, это совершенно буквально. Если вообще когда-нибудь взгляд мужчины может выражать страстное и неприкрытое обожание  сейчас оно было написано на его лице. И эта дань обожания  тебе, Гертруда Макдауэлл, и ты знаешь это.Эди начала собираться в путь, давно ей было пора, и Герти заметила, что ее намек возымел желанное действие потому что по пляжу было довольно далеко до того места где можно подняться с коляской а Сисси сняла с близнецов беретки и принялась заботливо их причесывать конечно чтобы самой выглядеть симпатичней а каноник ОХанлон поднялся риза его встопорщилась колом на спине и отец Конрой передал ему листок с текстом и он начал читать     [] а Эди и Сисси тараторили все время про время и приставали к ней но Герти превосходно сумела им дать отпор и отвечала коротко с убийственной вежливостью когда Эди спросила не разбил ли ей сердце ее лучший поклонник внезапно бросив ее. Герти вся сжалась, словно от резкой боли. Глаза ее в тот же миг метнули холодную молнию, вместившую в себя безмерный заряд презрения. О да, это мучило ее, это резало по живому, потому что Эди, эта коварная кошка, отлично усвоила манеру говорить с невинным видом такие вещи, которые, как сама она знала, ранят и убивают. Губы Герти раскрылись, слово уже готово было слететь с них, но ей так и не удалось его сказать, потому что рыдания подступили к горлу, ее гибкому, совершенно идеальному горлу, линии которого восхитили бы любого художника. Он ведать не ведал, как сильно она любила его. Легкомысленный обманщик, ненадежный, непостоянный, как весь его пол, он никогда в жизни не сумел бы понять, сколько он значил для нее, и на мгновение ее глаза уже защипало от слез.Но они так и сверлили ее своими безжалостными глазами, и, сделав героическое усилие, она нарочно для них бросила самый благосклонный взгляд на нового своего вассала. О,  с быстротою молнии парировала Герти, смеясь и гордо вздернув головку,  год-то ведь високосный, я и сама могу выбирать, кого захочу.Она говорила чистым и звонким голосом, мелодичным как воркованье лесного голубя, и все же в наступившем молчании ее слова падали резко и холодно. Что-то явно слышалось в этом молодом голосе, что давало понять:такая девушка никому не игрушка. А мистера Регги со всем его бахвальством и с капиталами она бы просто отодвинула ножкой, как мусор с дороги, и больше никогда бы не вспоминала, и эту его несчастную открытку разорвала бы на мелкие кусочки. И если бы он когда-нибудь еще осмелился, она бы его наградила таким взглядом, с таким презрением, что он бы умер на месте. У ее ничтожества мисс Эди физиономия весьма вытянулась, стала, можно сказать, темней черной тучи, и Герти насквозь видела, что она готова просто лопнуть со злости, хотя и не подает виду, маленькая киннат[], потому что у ней задели самое больное место, ее мелкую зависть, они же обе знали, что она-то в этих делах при пиковом интересе, навек чужая на этом празднике жизни, и кое-кто еще тоже это отлично знал и видел, так что им теперь только оставалось утереться.Эди уложила поудобней малютку, готовясь в путь, Сисси собрала лопатки, ведерки, мячик, и было уже совсем пора, Бордмену-младшему подошло время засыпать. И Сисси ему сказала, что где-то тут уже бродит Вилли Закрой Глазки и, значит, малюткам пора бай-бай, но малютка, никак не унимаясь, радостно таращил глазенки и хохотал, так что Сисси стало самой смешно, и она пощекотала слегка его пухленькое брюшко, а он, не нуждаясь в позволении, тут же излил свою горячую благодарность на новенький нарядный слюнявчик. Вот тебе на!  расстроилась Сисси.  Приехали с орехами. Совсем слюнявчик испортил.Этот легкий [] потребовал ее внимания, но в два счета она вновь навела порядок.У Герти вырвалось сдавленное восклицание, она нервно кашлянула, и Эди тут же переспросила что-что, и ей хотелось ответить глухим две обедни не служат, но она всегда соблюдала самые светские манеры и поэтому просто тактично обошла, ответив что это благословение потому что как раз в ту минуту над берегом прозвучал в тишине удар церковного колокола потому что каноник ОХанлон вошел в алтарь в облачении которое надел ему на плечи отец Конрой и благословлял держа в руках Святые Дары.Как трогала чувства вся эта сцена в наплывающих сумерках, и Эрина прощальная краса[], и наводящий думы вечерний звон, и юркая тень летучей мыши, что снялась с колокольни, увитой плющом, и с тоненьким жалобно-растерянным криком носилась острыми зигзагами на гаснущем фоне неба. Далеко-далеко светились огни маяков, так красиво, ей бы очень хотелось нарисовать это красками ведь это легче чем человека и скоро уже фонарщик выйдет в свой путь мимо пресвитерианской церкви потом по тенистой Трайтонвилл авеню где прогуливаются парочки потом он зажжет фонарь невдалеке от ее окна тот самый где Регги Уайли всегда разворачивал свой велосипед и все как в книжке Фонарщик мисс Камминс, которая еще написала Мейбл Вохен и другие истории. Дело в том, что у Герти были свои сокровенные мечты, которых она не открывала никому. Она любила стихи, и когда Берта Сапл подарила ей альбом для записи разных мыслей, очень миленький, в кораллово-розовой обложке, она его спрятала к себе, в свой туалетный столик, который, правда, нельзя было упрекнуть в роскоши, но зато он просто сверкал образцовой чистотой и порядком. Там, в ящичке, она сберегала свои девичьи сокровища, там у нее хранились черепаховые гребни, значок Детей Марии, духи Белая роза, краска для бровей, гипсовая шкатулочка для духов, ленточки, которые она меняла на белье, когда его приносили из стирки, а в альбоме уже были разные красивые изречения она их записывала фиолетовыми чернилами купленными у Хили на Дэйм-стрит и как ей чувствовалось она бы даже могла сама сочинять стихи если бы только умела так хорошо выражаться как в этом стихотворении она его случайно увидела в газете куда были завернуты овощи и оно так понравилось ей что она тут же переписала его все целиком. Оно называлось Идеал мой, ты лишь греза, сочинил Луис Дж.Уолш из Маэрфелта[], и дальше шло сумерки, о ты, о скоро ль? или вроде этого и часто от прелести стихов, столь грустной в своей хрупкой красе, взор ее застилали тихие слезы потому что она чувствовала что годы ее уходят один за другим и если бы не этот единственный недостаток она бы вообще не знала соперниц все из-за того случая когда она спускалась по Долки-хилл и она всячески старалась это скрывать. Но она чувствовала, дальше так не может тянуться. Если бы только она уловила в его глазах этот волшебный зов, ее бы ничто не остановило. Любовь не запереть под замок[]. Она бы принесла великую жертву. Она бы старалась всеми усилиями разделить его мысли. И она стала бы для него дороже всего на свете и наполнила его дни счастьем. Но тут оставался наиважнейший вопрос, ей просто смертельно надо было узнать, женат он или вдовец, потерявший свою супругу, а может быть, случилась трагедия, как у того знатного дворянина из страны песен, который вынужден был поместить ее в сумасшедший дом, из жалости жестокость проявляя[]. Но даже допустим  ну и что? Такая ли уж большая разница? Глубоко сидящий инстинкт отталкивал ее от малейшей неделикатности, грубости. Ей были отвратительны эти создания, падшие женщины, что прохаживаются по берегу Доддера, не гнушаясь солдатами и мужичьем, забыв про девичью честь и позоря свой пол, их даже забирают в полицию. Нет, нет, что угодно, только не это. Они будут просто хорошие друзья, как взрослые брат с сестрой, и больше ничего такого, вопреки всем нравам Общества с большой буквы. А может быть, он носил траур в память о былой страсти, владевшей им в незапамятные деньки[]. Ей думалось, она поняла. Она постаралась бы его понять, потому что мужчины, они настолько отличаются. Старая любовь все ждала, ждала, простирая тонкие белоснежные руки, с мольбою устремляя голубые глаза. Сердце мое! Она пошла бы за своей любовью, своей мечтой, не оглядываясь, следуя только голосу сердца, которое говорило ей, что он  все для нее, единственный в целом мире, ибо одна любовь правит всем. Больше ничто не важно. Будь что будет, она порвала бы все оковы, все запреты, она была бы свободна.Каноник ОХанлон положил Святые Дары обратно в дарохранительницу и преклонил колена, хор запел    [], и он запер дарохранительницу потому что обряд благословения был окончен и отец Конрой подал ему шляпу а Эди, противная кошка, спросила ты что не собираешься идти но тут Джеки Кэффри закричал: Ой, Сисси, погляди!И все посмотрели, может быть, это зарницы, но Томми тоже это увидел, там, над деревьями, за церковью, красное и синее и зеленое. А, это фейерверк,  сказала Сисси.И все они побежали по пляжу, чтобы поспеть увидеть над церковью и над домами, всей гурьбой, Эди с коляской, в ней малыш Бордмен, Сисси и Томми и Джеки, она их держала за руки, а то могли упасть на бегу. Герти, иди сюда,  позвала Сисси.  Это фейерверк в честь благотворительного праздника.Но Герти была тверда. Она не намерена бегать за ними как на веревочке.И она отвечала, что, если им нравится, они могут скакать как угорелые, а она посидит, ей и отсюда хорошо видно. Глаза, что были прикованы к ней, волновали ей кровь и сердце. На миг она глянула прямо на него, и взоры их встретились, и словно молния озарила все ее существо. Жгучая страсть была на его лице, безмолвная как могила, и эта страсть покорила ее ему.Наконец то они были одни, без людской зависти и докуки, и она знала, что этому человеку можно довериться на жизнь и на смерть, что он верен и тверд и что он человек чести до последнего дюйма. И руки и лицо его были в возбуждении, и ее охватила дрожь. Она сильно откинулась назад, стараясь разглядеть фейерверк, обхватила колени руками, чтобы не потерять равновесие, и совершенно никто не мог увидеть, только она и он, когда она совсем открыла свои хорошенькие ножки, вот так, они были нежно упругие, изящно округленные, словно выточенные, и ей казалось, будто она так и слышит его неровное тяжкое дыхание и гулкий стук его сердца, потому что она уже знала насчет таких вот мужчин, страстных, с горячей кровью, потому что Берта Сапл однажды ей рассказала под самым страшным секретом, чтобы никогда никому, про их квартиранта из Комиссии по Перенаселенным Районам, он вырезал из журналов картинки с полуголыми шансонетками и с танцовщицами, задирающими ноги, и она сказала он занимался кое-чем нехорошим можешь сама догадаться чем иногда у себя в постели. Но тут ведь совершенно другое потому что огромная разница потому что она почти чувствовала как он привлекает ее лицо к своему, почти осязала первое быстрое обжигающее прикосновение этих красивых губ. И потом, есть ведь и отпущение грехов, если только ты не позволила этого самого до свадьбы и еще пусть были бы священники женщины им бы не нужно было все говорить словами они бы так поняли а у Сисси Кэффри тоже иногда бывает такой блаженный вид с совершенно блаженными глазками так что и ты, моя милочка, а эта Уинни Риппингам что просто помешана на фотографиях актеров и потом это все из-за того что как раз это самое начинается вот это из-за чего.И Джеки Кэффри закричал, смотрите, там еще, и она еще отклонилась назад, и подвязки у нее были голубые, это подходило к прозрачному, и все увидели и закричали смотрите, смотрите, вон там, и она еще и еще сильней отклонялась назад, чтобы разглядеть фейерверк, и что-то непонятное носилось в воздухе, темное, туда и сюда. И она увидала большую римскую свечу[], которая поднималась над деревьями, выше и выше, и все в восторге затаили дыхание, молча и напряженно следя, как она поднимается все выше, выше, и ей приходилось все дальше и дальше запрокидываться назад, почти ложась на спину, чтобы следить за ней, еще, еще выше, почти скрылась из глаз, и лицо ее залилось дивным пленительным румянцем от такой позы, и теперь он мог увидеть еще много нового, батистовые панталоны, материя прямо ласкает кожу, и лучше чем те зауженные зеленые за четыре одиннадцать, а эти беленькие, и она ему позволяла и видела что он видит а свеча поднялась так высоко что на мгновение совсем исчезла и все мускулы у нее дрожали из-за того что так запрокинулась а перед ним было полное зрелище гораздо выше колен такого она еще никогда никому даже на качелях или переходя вброд но ей не было стыдно и ему тоже не было что он так неприлично впился глазами он же не мог устоять перед таким дивным зрелищем когда перед ним все так открыто как у тех танцовщиц что задирают ноги совершенно неприлично а мужчины смотрят на них и он все смотрел смотрел.Ей хотелось закричать, позвать его задыхающимся голосом, протянуть к нему свои тонкие белоснежные руки, чтобы он пришел, чтобы она ощутила его губы на своем чистом лбу, крик любви юной девушки, слабый сдавленный крик исторгнутый у нее против воли, звенящий сквозь все века и эпохи. И тут взвилась ракета, на мгновение ослепив, Ах! и лопнула римская свеча, и донесся вздох, словно Ах! и в экстазе никто не мог удержаться, Ах! Ах! и оттуда хлынул целый поток золотых нитей, они сверкали, струились, ах! и падали вниз как зелено-золотые звезды-росинки, ах, это так прекрасно! ах, это дивно, сказочно, дивно!И как росинки, они растаяли в сгустившихся сумерках  и настало молчание. Ах! Она поспешно выпрямилась и бросила на него быстрый несмелый взгляд, полный кроткого протеста, мягкого застенчивого упрека, и под этим взглядом он покраснел словно девушка. Спиною он прислонялся к скале.Леопольд Блум (ибо это был он) стоит молча, потупив голову под ее чистым невинным взглядом. Какой же он гнусный тип! Снова за старое? Юная неиспорченная душа воззвала к нему, а он, жалкое существо, как же он на это откликнулся? Проявил себя как последний подонок! Причем не кто-нибудь, он! Но в этих глазах светилось безграничное милосердие, они и его готовы были простить, пускай он сбился с пути, блуждал и грешил. Разве девушка должна говорить? Нет, тысячу раз нет. Это их секрет, их личная тайна, которую скрыли сумерки и которую будут знать лишь они одни  да маленькая летучая мышь, что мягко носилась туда-сюда, а летучие мыши умеют хранить секреты.Сисси Кэффри свистнула по-мальчишечьи, показать свои необыкновенные таланты, и громко позвала: Герти! Герти! Мы уходим, пошли! Мы еще оттуда, сверху, посмотрим.И тут у Герти мелькнула мысль, одна из маленьких уловок любви. Ее пальцы скользнули в нагрудный кармашек, вынули надушенную ватку, и она помахала ею, как бы в ответ, конечно, следя за ним, и потом сунула обратно. Хотя не слишком ли далеко до него. Она поднялась. Так это прощание? О, нет. Ей нужно идти, но они еще встретятся, снова встретятся здесь, а до той минуты она будет мечтать об этом, мечтать завтра о том, что привиделось накануне. Она выпрямилась во весь рост. Их души слились в последнем, долгом и томном взгляде, и глаза его, полные странным сиянием, проникли в глубь ее сердца и сами, словно завороженные, не могли оторваться от ее лица, нежного как цветок. Она слабо улыбнулась ему, улыбкой нежной и всепрощающей, улыбкой, готовою перейти в слезы,  и они расстались.Медленно, не оглядываясь назад, она шла по неровной полосе пляжа туда, к Сисси, Эди, к Томми и Джеки Кэффри, к малышу Бордмену. Заметно стемнело, а на пляже там и сям попадались камни, обломки дерева, скользкие водоросли. Она двигалась со спокойным достоинством, свойственным ей всегда, однако осторожно и очень медленно, потому что  потому что Герти МакдауэллТуфли жмут? Нет. Она хромая! О-о!Мистер Блум смотрел, как она ковыляет прочь. Бедняжка! Так вот она почему осталась сидеть, когда все помчались. Я так и думал, тут что-то не то, по всему ее виду. Покинутая красотка. Когда такое у женщины, это в десять раз хуже. Зато делаются обходительней. Хорошо, что еще не знал, когда она устроила свою выставку. Но все равно, горячий чертенок. Не возражал бы. Из разряда диковинок как с монахиней, или с негритянкой, или когда она в очках Та косоглазенькая, кстати, весьма субтильна. Наверно, месячные скоро, это подзуживает их. У меня сегодня ужасно болит голова. А куда я его сунул, это письмо? Тут, все в порядке. Всяческие бредовые прихоти. Полизать монетку. Та монахиня в монастыре Транквилла рассказывала, что у них одна девица обожает запах нефти. У старых дев, думаю, уже помешательство под конец. Сестра, как ее? А у скольких женщин в Дублине это сегодня? Марта, эта. Что-то такое в воздухе. Луна влияет. А тогда почему не у всех женщин менструации в одно время, фазы-то у луны те же? Наверно, еще зависит от даты рождения. А может, все начинают одинаково, а после выходят из графика. У Молли и Милли иногда совпадает.Как бы там ни было я-то воспользовался случаем. Правильно, что не стал утром в бане, над этим ее дурацким я тебя проучу посланием. Это мне в утешение за тот трамвай утром. Болван Маккой привязался со всякой чушью. А эта его жена ангажемент в провинции чемодан, голосишком пополам перепилит.Признателен за вашу небольшую услугу. Притом дешево. По первой просьбе.Потому что им самим хочется. Естественное желание. Каждый вечер их целые косяки из контор. Лучше воздерживаться. Когда за ними не бегаешь, сами липнут. Так и бери тепленькими. Жаль, они сами себя не видят. Грезы о чулочках с аппетитной начинкой. Где это было? Ах, да. Картинки в райке на Кейпл-стрит, только для мужчин. Что подглядел Том. Шляпа Вилли и как девочки позабавились с ней. Их правда снимают в этаком виде или тут трюк?[] придает эффект. Ласкал ее формы под легким дезабилье. Их это самих возбуждает. Я вся чистенькая, иди запачкай меня.Любят наряжать друг дружку перед великой жертвой, Милли была в восторге от новой блузки у Молли. Для начала. Все наденет, чтобы потом все снять.Молли. С чего я купил ей сиреневые подвязки. Да и мы тоже: какой он галстук надел, и брюки с манжетами[], и носки красивые. Пришел он в новых гетрах в тот первый вечерок[]. Нарядная рубашка и на кудрях  чего бы там?  венок. Говорят, потерять шпильку  потерять поклонника. Пришпиливают. Эх, у Мэри панталоны на одной булавке. Нарядилась для кого-то как модная куколка. Во многом их шарм за счет моды. Как только раскусят моду, она меняется. А на Востоке не так: Мария, Марфа, что сейчас что тогда[]. Никакие серьезные предложения не отвергаются. Она вовсе не торопилась. Спешат они только на свидание. В жизни не позабудут. Наверно, просто так вышла, поискать счастья. Они все верят в случай, это у них в натуре. А другие все ее норовили подколоть. Школьные подружки ходят, обнявшись или переплетя пальцы, целуются каждую минуту и нашептывают друг дружке всякую чепуху под страшным секретом где-нибудь в монастырском садике. Монашки в строгих наколках, лицо вымыто известковым молоком, трясут своими четками, злобятся на все, чего им не полагается. Колючая проволока. Не беспокойся и пиши мне. А я тебе. Только будешь ли? Молли и Джози Пауэлл. Пока не найдет себе, а там видятся раз в год по обещанию. ! Господи, нет, вы посмотрите, кто это! Ну как, как ты там? Что у вас делается? Целуются я так рада целуются что я тебя встретила. Вот-вот пробуравят друг дружку, выискивая изъяны в наружности. Ты выглядишь изумительно. Души-сестры нежно оскалились в улыбке. Так-так, а зубы-то у тебя все? Щепотку соли одна другой пожалеет.Эх!Когда у них это дело, они словно сатанеют. Мрачное дьявольское выражение. Молли говорит, любая вещица кажется в тонну весом. Или вдруг почеши мне пятки. Ага, ага, вот так! Ах, как чудесно! Со мной такое тоже бывает. Полезная передышка своего рода. Интересно, не вредно ли в эти дни быть с ними. С одной стороны, безопасно. При них молоко скисает, скрипичные струны лопаются. Где-то еще читал, в саду цветы вянут. Говорят, если увидишь женщину с увядшим цветком, значит, она кокетка. Все они.Пожалуй, она заметила, что я. Когда на это настроен, почти всегда это подвернется. Понравился я ей, что ли? Они всегда смотрят, как одет. Если он за кем ухаживает, тут же это определят: при воротничке, при манжетах.Кстати, у петухов то же самое, и у оленей, у львов. А иногда вдруг им нравится, если галстук или еще там что не в порядке. Брюки? А вдруг бы я в тот момент когда я? Нет-нет. Надо деликатно. Не любят, когда грубо набрасываются. Поцелуй во тьме и вечная тайна. Что-то она нашла во мне.Интересно, что. Уж лучше я чем какой-нибудь рифмоплет, волосенки мажет медвежьим салом, над десным оком завиточек приклеен. Для помощи джентльмену в литературных. В моем возрасте уже надо следить за внешностью. В профиль я к ней не поворачивался. Хотя тут не угадаешь.Хорошенькие за уродов выходят. Чудище и красавица[]. Потом, я уж не совсем, как-никак Молли. Сняла шляпу показать волосы. Поля широкие. С такими покупают прятать лицо, если кого знакомого встретит, опустит голову или станет нюхать букетик ах как пахнет. От волос во время любви. Очески Молли я продал за десять шиллингов, когда бедствовали на Холлс-стрит. А что такого? Или, допустим, он ей даст денег. Что такого? Одни предрассудки.Она стоит и десять, и пятнадцать, и фунт. А то все за так. Почерк, и тот нахальный. Миссис Мэрион. Адрес-то я не забыл на письме, а то, может, как с той открыткой, что послал Флинну? А однажды пошел к Дримми и галстук забыл надеть. Но тогда это сцена с Молли меня расклеила. Нет, я помню.Ричи Гулдинг, тот не такой. Все взвесит. Странно, мои часы остановились в полпятого. Пыль. Маслом из акульей печенки их смазывают. Я бы и сам мог.Дешевле. Может, это точно в момент, когда он с ней?Да, он был с ней. В ней. Она с ним. Заделано.Эх!Мистер Блум аккуратно расправил влажный подол рубашки. Все эта хромая бестия. Становится липко, зябко. Последствия не очень приятны. Что делать, надо же как-то разрядиться. Их это не смущает. Может, даже им льстит.Потом домой, к вечерней булочке с молочком, перед сном прочтет молитву с детишками. Что, не такие они? Увидишь ее какая есть, и все испорчено. Тут требуются декорации, костюм и грим, позы, музыка. И имя важно. Амуры актрис. Нелл Гвин, миссис Брейсгердл, Мод Брэнском[]. Поднимается занавес.Лучезарное серебро луны. Выступает дева с задумчивым лоном. Приди в мои объятия, сладость моя. Но все-таки чувствуется. Придает силы человеку.Тут то и весь секрет. Хорошо, я там у стенки отлил, выйдя от Дигнама. Все этот сидр. Иначе не вышло бы. А после тянет запеть. Лакауз эсант[], тара-тара . Допустим, я бы заговорил с ней. О чем только? Лучше не начинать разговор, если не знаешь, чем кончить. Задай вопрос, они тебе другой. Хороший выход, если видишь, завяз. Конечно, это приятно, если ты ей: добрый вечер, и сразу видишь, она тоже идет навстречу: добрый вечер. Ох, но как вспомню тот вечер, когда чуть-чуть не заговорил с миссис Клинч на Аппиевой дороге[], принял ее в потемках за. Ужас! А в другой вечер девка на Мит-стрит. Заставлял ее повторять всякую похабень. Она коверкала, конечно. Моя жожо, называла свою. Редко найдешь, которая бы. Хо-хо! Пока не свыклась, ей, наверно, ужасно, когда заговорит с кем-то, а тот ноль внимания. Поцеловала руку, когда дал ей лишних два шиллинга. Автоматы. Нажмешь кнопку -птичка чирикнет. Но все-таки лучше б не называла сэр. А какие у нее губы в темноте, о! Женатый мужчина со свободной девицей. Вот что им самое приятное. Отнять у другой ее мужчину. Или хоть послушать про это. Во мне нет такого. Не стал бы связываться с чужой женой. Объедки с чужой тарелки.Как у того типа в трактире, хрящи непрожеванные. А презерватив все еще у меня в бумажнике. Из-за чего половина проблем. Но может же однажды стрястись, правда? Входишь. Все приготовлено. Я тут вздремнула. Что? Хуже всего начало. Меняются как по волшебству, едва увидят, что не в их вкусе.Вопросы: а вы любите грибы, это значит, знала кого-то, кто. Или: а как вы думаете, что он, кто-то там, этим хотел сказать, когда вдруг раздумал и перестал. Но если уж ты всерьез, так и говори, мол, хочу, или в этом роде.Раз уж решил. И она. Вроде обидь ее. А потом загладь. Сделай вид, как будто чего-то до смерти хочешь, потом как бы откажись ради нее. Это им льстит. Наверняка она думает про кого-то другого все это время. Ну и что?Как выучилась думать, с тех пор и думает, не про того, так про этого.Первый поцелуй все решает. Роковой миг. Пружинка какая-то разжимается. Вся сразу млеет, хоть держится, а по глазам видно. Первый порыв не сравнить ни с чем. Помнится до смертного часа. У Молли, это когда ее лейтенант Малви поцеловал за садами, под Мавританской стеной[]. Пятнадцать, по ее словам. Но уже груди были вполне. А после крепко заснула. После обеда в Гленкри, когда ехали домой через гору Фезербед. Скрипела зубами во сне. Лорд-мэр на нее очень поглядывал. Вэл Диллон. Апоплектик.Вон она там, с ними, глядят фейерверк. И у меня фейерверк. Подымется ракетой, опадет плетью[]. А ребятишки, похоже что близнецы, только и ждут каких-нибудь происшествий. Хочется быть взрослыми. Наряжаются в мамашины платья. Будет время, еще поймут, как все на свете устроено. А эта растрепанная чернушка с негритянскими губами. Так и знал, что она умеет свистеть. Подходящие губы для этого. Как у Молли. Та шикарная шлюха у Джеммета, странно, отчего у нее такая вуаль короткая, только до носа.Будьте добры, вы мне не скажете время? Скажу в свое время, где-нибудь в укромном местечке. Если толстые губы, каждое утро сорок раз повторять: пруды, призмы[]. И очень ласковая с младенцем. Со стороны видно. Конечно, они чувствуют животных, птиц, маленьких детей. Это по их части.Когда шла по пляжу, не оглянулась. Не снизошла. Те приморские красотки.Красивые у нее глаза, ясные. Это скорей белки создают впечатление, зрачки не так важно. А все-таки знала она, что я? Наверняка. Так кошка вспрыгнет, где не достать собаке, и глядит на нее. Женщины всегда остерегаются таких, как наш Уилкинс в школе, рисует Венеру, а у самого так и выпячивается.Может, это и есть невинность? Бедный кретин! Жене его авансом полное обозрение. Они в жизни не сядут на свежевыкрашенную скамью. Все вокруг обшарят глазами. Заглянут под кровать неизвестно зачем. Все время ищут чего-то остренького. И сами востры как иголки. Говорю Молли, что этот встречный на углу Кафф-стрит был приятной наружности, показалось, он ей понравился, а она отвечает, у него же вместо руки протез. И правда. Как это у них так выходит? Секретарша у Роджера Грина поднималась по лестнице через две ступеньки, чтобы, кто сзади, видели бы всю канцелярию.Передается от отца, то бишь от матери, к дочери. В крови у них. Милли, например, сушит свои платочки на зеркале, чтоб не гладить. Лучшее место для рекламы, если что-нибудь дамское, это на зеркале. Или когда послали ее забрать шотландскую шаль от Прескотта, не забыть, кстати, про объявление для него, на обратном пути спрятала сдачу в чулок! Догадливая плутовка.Никто ее этому не учил. Идет с какой-нибудь ношей, несет изящно, легко.Такие мелочи привлекают мужчин. Когда руки красные, поднимет в воздух, помашет, чтобы кровь отлила. Это кто ж научил тебя? Никто. Мне няня сказала. Их и учить не надо! Однажды, когда годика три было, уселась за туалетным столиком Молли, на Западной Ломбард-стрит, уже съезжать собирались. Я класивая! Моллингар. Кто знает? Так на свете устроено.Молоденький студент. Во всяком случае, уже на своих ногах, не то что другие. Но та, это штучка. Боже, до чего мокро. Черт, еще как. Ножки кругленькие. Чулочки прозрачные, натянутые  вот-вот лопнут. Не то что то чучело. А.Э. Чулки гармошкой. Или та, что на Грэфтон-стрит. В белых. Фу!Толстомясая.Взорвалась с шумом шутиха, разбрызгивая трескучие искры. Трах-тарарах!И Сисси с Томми и Джеки побежали смотреть, следом Эди с коляской, а за ними и Герти, огибая скалу. Оглянется? Оглянись! Взгляни! Посмотрела.Словно почуяла. Миленькая, я видел твои. Все-все видел.О, господи!По крайней мере, мне полегчало. А то после Кирнана, после Дигнама совсем сник. Признателен я вам за облегченье[]. Из Гамлета. О, господи!Тут все было сразу. Возбуждает. Когда она навзничь, даже кончик языка засвербило. Вскружат голову бедняжке. Это он верно. Мог бы худшего дурака свалять. Лучше так, чем трепаться ни о чем. Тогда я тебе скажу все. А пожалуй, у нас и было какое-то общение. Кстати, а вдруг она и есть? Да нет, они ее звали Герти. Ну и что, могло быть фальшивое имя, как у меня, и адрес Долфинс-барн липовый.Она звалась в девицах Джемма БраунИ приглашала в гости в Айриштаун[].Это место меня навело на такие мысли. Все они одним миром мазаны. Об чулки вытирают перья. Но мячик будто знал подкатился к ней. Пуля сама цель знает[]. Конечно, я и в школе-то не умел кидать прямо. Вечно куда-нибудь по кривой. А грустно, что им всего-то отпущено два-три года, а там пойдут кастрюли да скоро папины штаны будут Вилли впору[] да присыпка для малыша после того как высадили сделать а-а. Житье не сахар. Зато спасительно. Не даст сойти с пути истинного. Естество. Обмывают младенцев, обмывают покойников. Дигнам. Вечно облеплены детишками. Головенки с кокосовый орех, еще мозжечок не затянулся, как есть мартышки, в пеленках кислое молоко, разложившийся творожок. Не надо было давать тому ребенку пустую соску. От этого у них только газы. Миссис Бьюфой, Пьюрфой. Стоило бы зайти в больницу. Там ли еще та медсестра, Каллан. Иногда заходила приглядеть за ребенком, когда Молли работала в кафе. А этот молодой доктор ОХейр, смотрю однажды, она чистит ему пальто. Когда-то миссис Брин с миссис Дигнам были такие же вот, на выданье. Самое худшее по ночам, как миссис Дугган рассказывала в Городском гербе. Муж притащится на бровях, от него смердит кабаком как от хорька. А ты дыши всю ночь этим вонючим перегаром.Наутро спросит: никак я был под хмельком с вечера? Но все-таки неправильно все валить на мужей. Тут как аукнется, так и откликнется. Рыбак рыбака видит издалека. Женщины не без греха тоже. И вот уж тут Молли вне конкуренции. Южная кровь. Мавританская. К тому же лицо, фигура. Руки ласкали ее пышные. С другими никакого сравненья. Запрет жену дома как скелет в гардеробе. Позвольте вам представить мою. И выплывает нечто неописуемое, не знаешь, каким словом назвать. Всегда видно по жене, где слабые места у мужчины. С другой стороны, судьба, уж кого полюбишь. У каждой пары есть свой секрет. Иной давно пошел бы ко дну, если бы жена его не взяла в ежовые рукавицы. Или, скажем, жена  малявочка, и муж  коротышка. Созданы друг для друга. А дети, глядишь, получатся вполне ничего. Ноль да ноль единица[]. Или еще богатый старик под семьдесят и рядом с ним юная, краснеющая. Женился-вздурился, наутро каялся. Фу, как мокрое неприятно. Липнет. Хорошо не залуплен. Давай отлепи-ка.М ме!Или наоборот, сам каланча, а жена ему до пупка. В длинном и кратком варианте. Огромный и крохотная. Очень что-то странное с моими часами.Наручные вечно портятся. Может, есть какие-то магнитные волны от людей, ведь именно в это время он. Да, я думаю, сразу. Кот со двора  мышки за пирушку. Помню, на Пилл-лейн я смотрел. И что сейчас, тоже магнетизм. За всем скрывается магнетизм. Земля, например, притягивает и сама притягивается. Отсюда происходит движение. А время? Тоже понятно, раз есть движение  на него нужно время. Значит, если где-то что-то там остановится, так и вся эта астролябия постепенно. Уж так устроено.Магнитная стрелка может сказать, что делается на солнце, на звездах.Простой кусочек железа. Когда подносишь магнит к железу. Ближе. Ближе.Хоп! В точности, женщина и мужчина. Магнит и железо. Молли и он.Разоденутся, строят глазки, делают намеки, позволяют себя разглядывать, поддразнивают, ну погляди хорошенько, мужчина ты или нет, и уж тут, это как тяга чихнуть, ножки, глядишь, глядишь, и если ты только не деревяшка.Хоп! Прощайся со всем.Интересно как у нее самочувствие в тех местах: Стыд, это только на зрителя. А так ее дырка на чулке больше волнует. Молли, голова вздернута, губы сжаты, это она на конной выставке, из-за того фермера в сапогах со шпорами На Западной Ломбард-стрит были художники. У одного замечательный голос. Джульини так начинал[]. Понюхай-ка мою мазню. Как цветы. И правда.Фиалками. Наверно, от скипидара в краске. Чего только не пускают в дело. А когда этим занималась, возила по полу шлепанцем, чтобы они не услышали.Мне кажется, из них очень многие неспособны кончить. Продолжают часами.Это как будто по всему телу и сзади до поясницы.Погоди ка. Хм-хм. Точно. Ее духи. Вот она что махала рукой. Оставляю на память, чтобы ты думал обо мне, когда я уже далеко, под одеялом. Что же это такое? Гелиотроп? Нет. Гиацинт? Хм-м. Пожалуй, роза. Такое она и должна любить. Дешево и сердито, но быстро портятся. Молли поэтому предпочитает опопонакс. Очень идет ей, когда с маленькой добавкой жасмина.Как низкие и высокие ноты в ее голосе. Она с ним познакомилась на танцевальном вечере, танец часов. В жару запахи сильней. Она была в своем черном, на нем сохранились еще духи от прошлого раза. Черное  хороший проводник. Или плохой? То же самое для света. Может, есть связь. Например, если спустишься в темный погреб. Вообще загадочно. Почему я только сейчас почуял? Движется медленно, но верно, как и она сама. Ведь это, если представить, миллионы и миллионы крохотных зернышек летят по воздуху.Именно так. Потому что Острова Пряностей, кстати, вспоминал сингалезов утром, они чувствуются по запаху за много миль. Сейчас скажу, что это такое. Это как тонкое кружево или паутинка, что их окутывает с головы до ног, тонкое-тонкое, как эта, как ее, кисея, и они беспрерывно ткут это из себя, тонкое как воздух, всех цветов радуги, сами того не чувствуя. И на всем, что она снимет с себя, оно остается. Подошвы ее чулок. Теплая туфелька. Корсет. Панталоны: слегка взмахнет ножкой, чтобы сбросить. Пока, до встречи. Кошка тоже любит зарыться в ее белье. Узнал бы ее запах из тысячи. И вода в ее ванне. Напоминает землянику со сливками. Интересно, откуда идет. Оттуда, или из подмышек, или между грудей. Такое впечатление, будто изо всех дырок и уголков. Гиацинтовые духи делают на эфирных маслах, кажется. Мускусная крыса. У ней под хвостом мешочек, там зернышки, и от каждого одного запах может стоять годами. Собаки друг друга сзади.Фук фук. Наше почтение. Вам также. Как вам нюхается? Фук-фук-фук. Отлично, благодарю. Животных ведет чутье. А присмотрись, у нас то же самое.Например, некоторые женщины так отпугивают, когда у них месячные.Подойдешь поближе, почуешь такое, что хоть топор вешай. Похоже на что?Может, на тухлую селедку? Бр-р! Просьба на этот газон не ступать.А они от нас, может быть, чуют мужской запах. Хотя что там? Перчатки, пропахшие сигарой, у Длинного Джона на столе. Дыхание? В нем только то, что съел или выпил. Не тут. В смысле, мужской запах. Скорей связан с этим делом, потому что у священников, которые обходятся без, у них другой.Женщины вьются вокруг них, как мухи над патокой. В алтарь не пускают  подберутся иначе, любой ценой. Запретный поп сладок. Ах, отче, а вам не хотелось бы? Пусть я буду первой. Это как-то расходится по всему телу и все пропитывает. Источник жизни. И запах такой интересный, странный. Как сельдерейный соус. А ну, дай-ка.Мистер Блум сунул свой нос. Фук-фук. За. Фук-фук. Пазуху своего жилета.Миндалем, что ли. Нет. Лимоном. Ах ты, да это ж мыло.А кстати кстати, лосьон-то. Я помню, еще что-то в голове было. Не зашел, и за мыло не заплатил. Не люблю таскаться с бутылочками, как та карга утром. Хайнсу пора бы уже отдать три шиллинга. Можно упомянуть просто Маэра, чтоб напомнить. Хотя, если он поможет с тем объявлением. Два и девять. Что он теперь обо мне подумает. Завтра зайти. Сколько я должен вам? Три девять? Два и девять, сэр. Ах, да. В другой раз может не отпустить в кредит. Вот так и теряют клиентов. В трактирах та же история.Иной дождется, пока счет стал в локоть длиной, и перекочует в другое заведение, а это будет сторонкой обходить.Опять этот важный, что уже проходил. Каким его ветром? Едва туда и уже обратно. К ужину минута в минуту. Гладкий, так и лоснится: недурно подзакусил. Теперь наслаждается природой. Его молитва после еды, пройти пешком милю. Наверняка счетец в банке, казенная служба. Можно пойти за ним по пятам, поставить в глупое положение, как меня мальчишки сегодня. Но это чему-то учит. Что видит взор его и прочих. Лишь бы женщины не смеялись, а остальное какая важность? Можно таким путем разведать. Или попробуй так угадай, кто он. Таинственный незнакомец на пляже, премированный рассказ мистера Леопольда Блума. Гонорар гинея за столбец. Как сегодня этот на кладбище в коричневом макинтоше. Хотя его фортуна натерла себе мозоли[].Кажется, у здоровых рассасываются. Свист, говорят, насылает дождик. Верно, идет где-нибудь. В Ормонде соль влажная. Тело чувствует перемену в воздухе. У старушки Бетти суставы ноют. Матушка Шиптон[] пророчила насчет кораблей, что смогут в один миг вокруг света. Нет. Это к дождю.Королевская предсказательница. И дальние холмы как будто стали ближе.Хоут. Маяк Бейли. Два, четыре, шесть, восемь, девять. Гляди-ка. Он должен мигать, иначе подумают, это дом. Спасатели. Грейс Дарлинг[]. Люди боятся темноты. И светлячки, велосипедисты, им тоже пора включать свет.Лучше всего сверкают драгоценные камни, алмазы. Женщины. Свет как-то успокаивает. Ничего нехорошего не случится. Конечно, сейчас лучше, чем в старину. На большой дороге. Кишки тебе выпустят ни за что ни про что.Бывают два типа, когда с кем-то столкнешься. Угрюмые и любезные. Пардон!Нет нет, ничего. Для поливки растений сейчас лучшее время, сразу после захода. Еще немного светло. Красные лучи самые длинные. Вэнс нас учил, как однажды Жак-звонарь головой свалил фонарь: красный, оранжевый, желтый, зеленый, голубой, синий, фиолетовый. А вот и звезда. Венера? Еще пока не скажешь, Вон и вторая, а ночь считается, когда три[]. Ночные облака, они там были все время? Словно корабль-призрак. Нет. Погоди. Может, это деревья?Оптический обман. Мираж. Здесь страна заходящего солнца. Солнце гомруля садится на юго-востоке. Родимая земля, спокойной ночи[].Роса выпала. Милочка, тебе вредно сидеть на камне. Белые выделения.Ребеночек не сможет родиться, разве что будет такой силач, пробьется с боем наружу. И сам могу схватить геморрой. Липуч как простуда летом или как лихорадка на губах. А еще хуже, если порежешься бумажкой или травинкой. Трение сидения. Было бы недурно побыть той скалой, на которой она сидела. Ах, милая крошка, ты и сама не знаешь, как ты была прелестна.Мне уже начинают нравиться в таком возрасте, зелененькие. Клюют на все, что им предлагают. Думаю, только в этом возрасте любят сидеть, поджав ноги. Сегодня в библиотеке, дипломницы. Блаженны стулья под ними. Но тут и вечер влияет. Они все это чувствуют. Знают свой час, раскрываются как цветы, подсолнухи, земляные груши, в бальных залах, люстры, фонари на аллеях. Какой-то ночной цветок у Мэта Диллона в саду, где я поцеловал ее в плечо. Хорошо бы иметь ее портрет маслом, во весь рост, какой она была тогда. И тоже был июнь, когда я за ней ухаживал. Возвращается год. История повторяется. О горные вершины, я к вам вернулся вновь[]. Жизнь и любовь путешествуют вокруг нашего маленького шарика. Что же на этот раз? Грустно, конечно, что она хромая, но надо остерегаться, слишком уж не впадать в жалость. Они на этом играют.На мысе Хоут сейчас все тихо. И дальние холмы как будто. Там, где мы.Рододендроны. Может быть, я осел. Ему достаются сливы, мне косточки от слив. Моя доля. А старый холм этого навидался. Меняются имена  и только.Влюбленные знай чмок-чмок.Устал я что-то. Хватит уже сидеть? Ох, погоди. Выпила из меня мужскую силу, негодница. Она меня целовала Молодость моя. Больше уж не вернется.Раз в жизни. И у нее. Съездить бы туда завтра. Нет. Это уже не то. Как ребенку второй раз в тот же дом. Хочешь нового. Ничто не ново под солнцем.Долфинс барн, до востребования. Так ты несчастлив в семейной? Мой противный, мой миленький. В Долфинс-барн играли в шарады у Люка Дойла. Мэт Диллон со своим выводком дочерей: Тайни, Этти, Флуи, Мэйми, Луи, Гетти. И Молли с ними. В восемьдесят седьмом это было. За год до нашей. Старый майор, любитель пропустить рюмочку. Интересно что она единственный ребенок и я тоже. Все возвращается. Думаешь, убежал и налетаешь на самого себя[].Кружной путь домой самый короткий. И в точности, когда она с ним. Цирковая лошадь по арене кругами. Мы разыграли Рип ван Винкль[]. Рип  прицепили Хенни Дойлу репей. Ван  ванна у них в доме. Винкль  бутылка вина и бумажный куль. А в конце я представил возвращение Рипа ван Винкля. Она смотрела, облокотясь на буфет. Мавританские глаза. Проспал двадцать лет в Сонной Пещере. Все изменилось. О нем забыли. Молодые состарились. Ружье заржавело от росы.Фрр. Что это тут летает? Ласточка? Никак, летучая мышь. Подслеповата, думает, что я дерево. А нюха разве у птиц нет? Метемпсихоз. Они верили, что от горя можно превратиться в дерево. В плакучую иву. Вон, вон полетела. Ишь ты, козявка-нищенка. Где она живет, интересно. Колокольня виднеется. Верней всего, там. Висит вверх ногами и дышит святостью.Видимо, звон вспугнул. А месса, кажется, кончилась. Все было слышно.Молись за нас. Да молись за нас. Да молись за нас. Повторение, это ценный прием. Как в рекламном деле. Покупай у нас. Да покупай у нас. Окошко в доме священника светится. За скромным ужином. Помнится, я ошибся в оценке, когда работал у Тома. На самом деле, там двадцать восемь. У них два дома.У Габриэла Конроя брат викарий[]. Фрр. Снова она. И почему они шастают по ночам, как мыши. Какая-то помесь. Птицы вообще вроде скачущих мышей. А что их пугает, свет или звук? Лучше не двигаться. Всякий инстинкт, это как у той птицы, когда захотела пить, догадалась набросать в кувшин камешков[].Похожа на человечка в плаще и с крохотными ручонками. Тонкие косточки.Чуть ли не видно как поблескивают, такие голубовато-белесоватые. Цвет зависит от освещения. Например, погляди на солнце, только не щурься, а как орел, и после на свой башмак: покажется желтое пятно. Хочет поставить свой штамп на всем. Скажем, этот кот на лестнице утром. Какого-то торфяного цвета. Говорят, будто не бывает трехцветных. Неправда. В Городском гербе был тигровый кот, рыжий, черный и белый, и на лбу метка как буква эм.Шкура пятидесяти цветов. Хоут только что засветился как аметист. Маяк сверкнул. Так вот этот мудрец, как бишь его, своим зажигательным стеклом[].А бывает, вдруг загорится вереск. И не от того, что турист бросил спичку.А от чего? Может, от ветра сухие стебли трутся один о другой и загораются.Или разбитая бутылка в кустах, луч солнца упадет  она как зажигательное стекло. Архимед. Эврика! Память пока работает.Фрр, еще раз. Кто знает, чего они без конца летают. За насекомыми? На прошлой неделе пчела влетела в комнату, гонялась за своей тенью на потолке. Может, та самая, что меня ужалила, вернулась проведать. И птицы тоже. Никогда не узнаешь, о чем говорят. Как наше чириканье. А он сказал а она сказала. Какие им нужны нервы, лететь через океан и обратно. Массами гибнут, штормы, телеграфные провода. И у моряков ужасная жизнь. Громадины, океанские пароходы, прут, пыхтя, сквозь ночную тьму, мычат как морские коровы.   ![] С дороги, так вашу перетак!А другие суденышки, парус что детская рубашонка, как пробки прыгают на волне, едва посильней задует. Взять кто женаты. Не бывают дома годами, мотаются по разным концам земли. У нее нет концов, круглая. Жена в каждом порту, так про них говорят. Суровая у ней жизнь, если не позволяет себе, пока Джонни не явился домой[]. Если он вообще появится. Пропахший всеми портовыми закоулками. И за что любить море? А они любят. Подняли якорь и в плаванье, на нем иконка или наплечник на счастье. Ну и что. А у отца бедного папы над дверью висели эти, как же их, тефилим[], нет, как-то иначе, и полагалось до них дотрагиваться. Исход из земли Египетской и в дом рабства[]. Что-то в них есть, во всех этих суевериях, не знаешь ведь, уходя в путь, что тебе там грозит. Ухватившись за доску или верхом на бревне, в жилетике надувном, цепляется за свою горемычную жизнь, глотает морскую воду, и такова его последняя выпивка, перед тем как акулы разорвут.Интересно, рыбы страдают морской болезнью?А чуть позже  дивная гладь, на небе ни облачка, полное спокойствие и безмятежность. Команда и груз мелким крошевом в брюхе у морского царя. С высоты мирно глядит луна. Не моя вина, храбрецы.Последняя запоздалая ракета благотворительного базара Майрас взлетела в небо для сбора средств на нужды больницы Мерсера и, падая вниз, рассыпалась гроздьями лиловых звезд, среди которых сверкала одна серебряная. Они плыли по небу, опускались, гасли. Час сумерек, час объятий, обетов. Почтальон с вечернею почтой снует от домика к домику, радуя обитателей знакомым двойным постукиваньем, и светлячок-фонарик на поясе у него мерцает то тут, то там в кустах молодого лавра. Фонарщик, подняв высоко свой пальник, зажигает фонарь, стоящий на Лихи-террас в окружении пяти молодых деревьев. Мимо освещенных экранов окон, мимо неотличимых садиков несется, удаляясь, пронзительный и жалобный крик:Ивнинг телеграф, экстренный выпуск! Итоги скачек на Золотой кубок! и из дверей дома Дигнамов выбежал мальчуган, окликая вдогонку. Летучая мышь, попискивая, металась взад и вперед. Прилив, пенистый, грязно-серый, набирал силу, подкрадывался к дальним пескам. Хоут укладывался спать, его, старика, утомил долгий день и чмоканья в рододендронах, и он с приятностью чувствовал, как ночной ветерок ерошит, почесывает его папоротную шкуру. Он улегся, но выставил сторожко красное недреманное око, дыша медленно, глубоко, дремля и бодрствуя в то же время. И вдалеке на отмели Киш плавучий маяк мигал, подмигивая мистеру Блуму.Несладко тем парням, которые там. Сиди, как на привязи. Ирландское Управление Маяков. В наказание за грехи. И береговая охрана. У тех ракеты, багры, буйки, лодки спасательные. Когда ездили на морскую экскурсию на Короле Эрина, бросили им тюк старых газет. Медведи в зверинце. Вшивая прогулочка. Пьянчуги вылезли протрясти печенку. Блюют через борт, кормят рыбок. Морская болезнь. Все женщины с перепуганными лицами. А Милли как ни в чем не бывало, хохочет. Голубой шарфик вьется по ветру. Не знают, что такое смерть, в эти годы. Притом желудки еще здоровые. Зато их пугает потеряться. Когда мы спрятались за дерево в Кромлине. Я был против. Мама!Мамочка! Детки в лесу. Еще любят пугать их масками. Или подкидывать в воздух и ловить. У-у, сейчас как брошу и разобьешься. Что тут забавного? А сами они играют в войну. Со всей серьезностью. Как это можно целиться в человека из ружья? Бывает иногда само выстрелит. Бедные дети. Ничем не болела, только крапивница и краснуха. Принес, помню, каломель. Как полегчало, уснула рядышком с Молли. У них зубы совсем одинаковые. Что в них любят? Свое подобие? А ведь как-то утром гонялась за ней с зонтиком.Может быть, только так, не больно. Я щупал у нее пульс. Бьется. Была маленькая ручонка  теперь большая. Дражайший папулька. Рука говорит все, когда ее трогаешь. Любила считать пуговицы у меня на жилете. Помню ее первый корсетик. Так смешно было. Грудки уже начинались. Кажется, левая чувствительней. У меня тоже так. Ближе к сердцу? Если в моде пышная грудь, вату подкладывают. В период созревания боли по ночам, стонала, я просыпался. А как испугалась, когда природа в первый раз заявила ей о себе. Бедный ребенок! И для матери это странный момент. Вспоминает свое девичество. Гибралтар. Вид от Буэна Виста. Башня ОХара. Птичьи крики над морем. Мартышки, один старый самец сожрал все свое семейство. Заход солнца, выстрел из пушки  сигнал всем вернуться в крепость. Смотрела на море, когда дала мне ответ[]. Вечер как сегодня, только ясней, безоблачней.Я всегда думала, что я выйду за лорда или за богача со своей яхтой.  , .      []. Тогда почему же я? А ты очень отличался от других.Чего я прилип к этой скале как улитка. Такая погода отупляет. Судя по свету, около девяти. На Лию или Лилию Килларни уже поздно. Домой. Хотя нет. Вдруг еще не легла. Зайду в больницу, проведаю. Надеюсь, она уже родила. Длинный денек мне выдался. Марта, в баню, на похороны, дом Ключей, музей и богини. Дедалово пение. Потом этот горлопан у Барни Кирнана. Но я там перед ними не спасовал. Пьяные пустозвоны. Как сказал про его бога, его аж перекосило. Ударом отвечать на удар  ошибка. Или нет? Нет-нет.Лучше бы разошлись по домам да там посмеялись над собой. Одно желание, собраться всем в кучу да наподдать. Как малые дети, боятся одни остаться.А если бы он ударил меня. Посмотрим с его точки зрения. Тогда ничего ужасного. Может, он и не хотел причинить боль. Тройное ура Израилю.Тройное ура его невестке, которую он расхваливал, с тремя последними зубами во рту. Тот же тип красоты. Милейшее общество для светского чаепития. Сестра жены дикаря с Борнео приехала в наш город[]. Представь-ка себе такое рядышком с собой поутру. На вкус и на цвет товарища нет, как сказал Моррис, облобызав корову. Но визит к Дигнамам меня совсем доконал.Дом в трауре страшно угнетает, потому что никогда не известно. Но ясно, что деньги ей требуются. Надо зайти к Шотландским вдовам[], раз обещал.Странное название. Подразумевает, что непременно мы раньше. Какая-то вдова возле Крамера  когда это было, в понедельник?  так на меня посмотрела.Схоронила беднягу-мужа и здравствует себе на страховку. Лепта вдовицы[]. А что такого? Чего ты от нее хочешь? Должна как-то устраиваться, чтоб жить дальше. Вот на вдовцов ужасно смотреть. Ходит словно потерянный. У несчастного ОКоннора жена и пятеро детей отравились моллюсками. Сточные воды. Совсем пал духом. Пусть бы какая-нибудь сердобольная купчиха в шляпе кастрюлей его пригрела. С физиономией как луна, в широченном фартуке, и прочно на буксир горемыку. Женские панталоны серой фланели по три шиллинга за пару, фантастическая дешевка. Говорят, дурнушку полюбишь  не разлюбишь. Только ни одна себя такой не считает. Люби, лги и будь красивой, потому что завтра умрем. Уж несколько раз его видел, все бродит, доискивается, кто же сыграл с ним шутку! К.к.: ку-ку. Такая судьба. Выпало ему, могло мне. Часто с какой-нибудь торговлей бывает так. Словно злой рок привяжется. Что-нибудь снилось мне этой ночью? Постой. Какая-то путаница.Она в красных шлепанцах. Турецких. И в мужских брюках. А положим, она попробует? Понравилась бы она мне в пижаме? Ужасно трудно сказать.Наннетти уехал. С почтовым. Сейчас уже где-то у Холихеда. Надо пробить эту рекламу для Ключчи. Хайнса обработать и Кроуфорда. И гарнитурчик для Молли. Ей-то уж есть на что его натянуть. А что это там? Может, деньги?Мистер Блум нагнулся и подобрал листок бумаги с песка. Поднес к глазам, пристально разглядел. Письмо? Нет. Ничего не разобрать. Надо бы идти. В самом деле. Только устал, не пошевельнуться. Из старой тетрадки. Все эти лунки, гальки, кто их сочтет? Можно найти что угодно. Бутылку с запиской о зарытых сокровищах, брошенную при кораблекрушении. Почта для посылок.Детишки любят бросать всякие вещи в море. Доверчивость? Хлеб, отпущенный по водам[]. А это что? Так, чурочка.Ох! Измочалила меня эта дева. Уже не чувствуешь себя молодым. А придет она сюда завтра? Ждать ее где-нибудь весь век. Должна вернуться. Убийцы всегда. А я?Подобрав маленькую чурку, мистер Блум вяло потыкал ею в песок. А если написать что-нибудь для нее? Может, и сохранится. Только что?Я[].Все равно какой-нибудь косолапый утром наступит. Бесполезно. Или же смоет. Прилив доходит сюда. У ее ног была лужица. Наклониться, увидеть там свое лицо, в темном зеркале, дохнуть на него, пойдет рябью. Кругом скалы, покрытые царапинами, рисунками, надписями. Ах, эти ее прозрачные! И они не знают, к тому же. Что он означает, тот свет. Я назвала тебя противным мальчишкой, потому что мне совершенно не нравится.ЕСТЬ. А.Места нет. Ну его.Мистера Блума башмак медленно затер буквы. Песок гиблая штука. На нем ничего не растет. Все вянет. Здесь нечего опасаться больших судов. Одни только баржи Гиннесса. Вокруг Киша за восемьдесят дней[]. Как будто нарочно сделано.Он отбросил свое стило, и чурка торчком воткнулась в вязкий песок. А мог бы попусту неделю стараться чтобы вот так. Случай. Мы больше никогда не увидимся. Но это было чудесно. Прощай, милая, спасибо тебе. Я почувствовал снова молодость.Если бы чуточку вздремнуть. Сейчас около девяти. Ливерпульский давно ушел. Уже и дымка не видно. И она пусть тоже. Впрочем, она уже. Белфаст. Я не поеду. Спешить туда, оттуда спешить в Эннис. Пускай уж он. Просто прикрою на минутку глаза. Не спать, только подремать. Сон никогда не повторяется точно тот же. Опять летучая мышь. Никакого вреда. Я только чуть-чуть.Ах милая все твои беленькие девичьи до самого верха я видел шлюха брейсгердл меня заставила люби липнет мы вдвоем противный Грейс Дарлинг она с ним в пол в постели метим псу хвост безделушки для Рауля какими духами твоя жена черные волосы вздымались ее окру сеньорита юные глаза Малви пухленькие сны вернуться закоулки Агендат чаровница-баловница мне показала свои на будущий год в панталончиках вернуться на будущий в свои будущий свои будущий.Летучая мышь мелькнула. Туда. Обратно. Туда. Мистер Блум с приоткрытым ртом, зарыв левый ботинок в песок, накренясь набок, посапывал. Я только чуть-чуть. Издалека донесся во тьме бой часов, и в их мерном бом-бам отчетливо слышалосьРо гаРо гаРо гаПробили и часы на каминной полке в доме священника, где каноник ОХанлон, отец Конрой и преподобный Джон Хьюз, О.И., подкреплялись бараньими отбивными под острым соусом, пили чай с бутербродами и беседовали проРо гаРо гаРо гаПотому что в этих часах выскакивала птичка из домика и так выкрикивала и Герти Макдауэлл ее заметила когда была здесь потому что она моментально все замечала, такой уж она была, Герти Макдауэлл, и она тут же заметила что этот иностранный джентльмен, который сидел на камнях и смотрел, что у него былиРо гаРо гаРо гаЭпизод []На Полдень к Холлсу Грядем.

Ибо сыщется ли где тот кто хотя малую улучив толику разумения не раскусил бы что пышность и блеск коснодвижное и к низости наклонное естество собою прикрывать могут или кто напротив столь туп и непросвещен чтобы того не постигать что изо всех благодеяний натуры ни одному с даром размножения отнюдь не сравниться так что надлежит всякому благонравному обывателю соделаться проповедником и наставником себе подобных и трепетать дабы то чему в прошлом столь блистательный был дан в державе почин в грядущем не оказалось бы отправляемо без прежнего совершенства буде с течением времени постыдные нравы низведут дошедшие к нам от предков почтенные обычаи до такого падения что потребна будет великая отвага тому кто возвысить дерзнет свой голос утверждая что нет на свете более гнусного проступка нежели в небрежении и забвении покинуть оный завет равно и заповедь и обетование каковой всем смертным предрекая изобилие либо грозя оскуденьем навек и неотвратимо высшим их долгом определил беспрестанное продолженье рода?А посему нет резонов[] нам повергаться в недоумение, ежели, как надежнейшие летописания повествуют, меж кельтами, не в обычае коих было нечто превозносить, по естеству своему превознесения не достойное, искусство врачевания всемерно почитаемо было. Не говоря уж об устроении домов призрения, приютов для прокаженных, парных бань, чумных ям, славнейшие их целители, происходившие из родов ОШил, ОЛи и ОХикки[], измыслили многоразличные способы, коими больных, а равно и расположенных к возврату недуга сызнова приводить в здравие, пускай бы снедали их даже бледная немочь либо Коннеллово детское недержание. И как неусумнительно что во всяком деле хоть несколько имеющем важности для общего блага сообразное с тою важностью приуготовленье потребно, то посему решен был меж ними план[](а был ли он сочинен как бы в предвиденье либо по зрелом опыте, то сказать затруднительно, оттого что сужденья позднейших разыскателей между собою разноречивы и даже доднесь нимало не приведены в ясность) в согласии с коим материнство от всякой превратности вполне бы сделалось упасенно, чрез то что каковой бы уход ни оказался потребен в сей жесточайший для всякой женщины час разрешения от бремени, и тот за самую малую мзду бывал бы незамедлительно доставляем, притом же не только тем кто многой казной владеет, но равно и тем кто, не имея достатков, скудную, а порой даже и худшую скудной влачит долю.Отныне и впредь никакие досаждения им не могли быть чинимы, ибо согласно все сознали и порешили, что не бывать никоим образом благоденствию, когда нет оного у матерей чадородных и коль скоро подобает вечность богам смертным же продолжение рода то присматривали за нею и как подходил час родильницу доставляли туда повозкою имея к сему большое усердие и побуждая один другого дабы она была принята в тот приют. О мудрой державы знак не только при узрении своем но даже и при одном заочном о нем узнании премногой хвалы достойный что они в предвидении своем чтили уже в ней мать, что тотчас зрела и чувствовала она как начинает быть всемерно оберегаемою и холимою!Отроча еще не раждено рачителей рвение разожже[]. Еще в лоне лежаи любовию людскою лелеемо. Вся надлежащая о сем с надлежащим же прилежанием сьвершена быша.

Сей бе от племене Израилева еже по свету носимо беаше и в далнюю сию даль притече. И се единым влекомь благоутробиемь чловеческымь одиноко влачися и дома сего достиже.Сему же дому Хорн есть хозяин. Ту содержит он одры числомь седьмдесят на нихже матере лежаща и страждуща суть да изведуть в мир здравая чада яко же ангел Господень провеща Марии. Сестрицы белыя четою тамо безсонно бдять болящим благоугождающе. Страсти лехчат сущим ту, ихже за двенадесять лун три сотни. Добрыя ложеслужителници сии суть именемь Хорна покой в полатах храняще.Служителница же услышавши яко прииде муж сей мяхкосерд убрусом главу покрыту подъя и иде еже ему врата отверсти. Зри, и се во мгновение ока молние твердь неба Ирландскааго на западе блистанием велиим облиста. И велми ужасеся си яко Господь Воздаятель хотяя сгубити водою весь род людскый за беззаконие и грехы его. И се знамением крестныим осени перси своя влече его да внидеть вборзе под кров. И муж сый ведый яко воля ея добра есть взыде в Хорна хоромы.Страшася в поздню пору прерывати покой преминашеся пришлец в передней.Во время оно с нею во суседстве витааху с возлюбленною женою и с любезною дщерию обаче оттоле девять уже лет яко странствова по разным морем и землям. В некый день повстреча ю во пристанищи града онаго и поклонение ея не отдасть. И се моляше ю еже его простити и добру указа вину юже си прият яко точию мельком лице ея увиде и не позна мняй яко младо зело. И от онех его словес просияста очеса ея и ланиты зардестася.И убо увиде на нем ризы темны и ужасеся яко горе его постиже. Обаче посем радовася яже опасася преже. Вопроси ю аще не присылаше ОХейр Целитель[] некоя добры вести от далняго брега и на то рече горестно воздыхающи яко ОХейр Целитель на небеси есть. И слыша то оный муж опечален премного бысть и вся внутренняя его испостраданием велми отяготишася. И ту поведа ему вся, кончину друга столь млада оплакивающи обаче аще горюющи ничтоже хотящи прекословити правосудию Божию. Рече яко удостоился бе кончины лепы и мирны по благостыни Господней отпущение грехов и приобщение святых тайн получивый и елеопомазание удом своим.Посем же муж инокиню вопроси со участием каковою смертию умерший умре и глагола ему еже умре от рака утробна на острове Моне трем летом минувшим на Избиение Младенец и моляяшеся она Всемилостивейшему Господу да упокоит душу его идеже жизнь вечная. Печалным речем сиим внимаяй, с главы он своея убор сложи и взор печален прият. И се некый час в скорби купно стояаста.Да воззрит убо всяк[] на конец грядущь иже есть смерть твоя и на персть объемлющу коегождо от жены рожденна яко аще наг изыде от чрева матере своея и такожде наг возвратися в последний час отшед яко же пришед.Муж пришедый в дом глагола к сиделице и вопроси ю о здравии тоя жены яже тамо бе и разрешения ждаше. И сиделица восприявши рече яко тая жена ныне три дни кряду муки терпяше яко рожеству зело люту быти обаче ныне конец уже приблизися. И рече еже виде рожества многа но ни едино тольми жестоко бысть яко сия жены.Напослед же возвести вся ему зане ведаше яко сый витааху во время оно близь того дома. И муж словесем ея внимаше зане чюдишеся яко жены тяжко труждахуся чад родити и такожде чюдишеся зрети лице ея еже муж всяк мняй яко лепо есть аще и лета мнози она яко служителница труждашеся. Девятью двенадесять истечений крови в неплодии ю укаряху.И егда тако беседоваста[] храмины двери отверзостася и клики слышны быша яко же бо аще мнозем за трапезою сидящим. И се убо вниде идеже они стояста уноша благороден ученик сый нарицаемый Диксон. Леополд же странный ведяше и от того часу егда сретостася в доме милосердия идеже пребываше сей ученик благороден понеже Леополд странный ту притече исцеления искати яко же бысть в персех уязвлен копием имже порази его летящий змий[] зело ужасен и лют и того ради сотвори ученик врачебное былие из нюхателныя соли и помазания елико же довлеет ему. И рече яко достоит ему ныне внити в тую храмину и с тыми веселие имети иже суть тамо. И Леополд странный рече еже достоит ему инуду отъити яко же бе муж потаен и лукав. Такоже и госпожа согласие с тем восприя и укори ученика сего аще и добре разуме яко странный сей прорече ложная словеса ради лукавства его. Обаче ученик тый не хотяше ни слышати ниже покорятися госпоже ниже прияти противное его желанию и глагола яко храмина сия чюдна есть. И Леополд странный вниде во храмину хотя аще и малое прохлаждение дати удом своим яко изнеможе зане поприща мнози прошед по окрестным землем и овогда похоти покоряшеся.И посреде храмины сея столешница бе сотворена от брезы корелския и четыре карлы от тоя же земли ю держаху и шевелнутися не можаху яко закляты бяху волхвованием. И на той столешнице мечи и ножи ужасны ихже сотвориша в велицей пещере ис пламене бела бесы тяжко труждающеся и укрепиша в розех буих и елениих имиже ту избыточествующе. И такожде быша сосуди иже соделаны по чародействам Бохмита[] из воздуха и песка морскаго яко же некий волхв дыхание свое в няже вдуваше яко в пузырь. И неиздреченна обилность на сей столешнице бе и всякая богатая и драгая и никтоже помысли вящшей обилности ниже вящшаго богатства. И такожде бе ковчежец сребрян иже отверст бе ток
